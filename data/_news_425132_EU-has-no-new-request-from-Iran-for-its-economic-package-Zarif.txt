TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Friday that the European Union has no new request from Iran for offering its economic package to save the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 “The only request of the EU is that Iran should remain committed to its obligations under the JCPOA,” he told reporters upon arrival in Vienna. Zarif was in Vienna to attend the joint commission of the JCPOA to discuss the EU’s package of proposals to save the nuclear deal. The EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and foreign ministers of France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China are attending the meeting. Since U.S. President Donald Trump’s exit from the nuclear pact on May 8, Iran has been seeking guarantees that its interests are protected otherwise it will resume nuclear activities at a greater speed. The deal, signed in July 2015, went into force in January 2016. Zarif said Iran expects the remaining signatories to the deal to uphold the Iranians’ political and nuclear rights along with the economic rights. Prior to his arrival in Vienna, Zarif made a tweet saying, “In Vienna for JCPOA Ministerial Meeting. My mandate is crystal clear: Forge practical solutions. Expecting EU/E3+2 counterparts to make verifiable & actionable commitments rather than lofty & obscure promises. Make no mistake: Sanctions & JCPOA compliance are mutually exclusive.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
