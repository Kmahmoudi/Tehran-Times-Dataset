TEHRAN – The Parliament Research Center plans to hold meetings this week to review the law on prohibition of the employment of retirees. Kazem Jalali, chairman of the research center, said on Sunday that the law will be discussed with executive and supervisory bodies so that a clever decision can be made in revision process, Mehr reported. Prohibiting employment of retirees is intended to involve the younger generations in top state jobs and provide job opportunities for others. Earlier this month, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the law will “break the closed management circle”, but also suggested that it should be revised.
