TEHRAN - The war of words between U.S. and Pakistani politicians doesn't seem to end. Latest to jump the bandwagon is U.S. envoy to UN Nikki Haley who has repeated allegations against Islamabad. Haley, the first Indian-American to hold a senior cabinet position in Trump administration, said the U.S. did not need to give money to countries that wish harm to America, go behind its back and try and “stop us from doing things”. “...I think there should be a strategic view on which countries we partner with, which ones we count on to work with us on certain things, and move forward accordingly. I think we just blindly allow money to keep going without thinking that this is real leverage. We have to use it,” Haley told US magazine ‘The Atlantic’ Haley, who recently resigned from her UN posting, launched a direct tirade against Pakistan for 'harboring terrorists'. “The one example I’ll give you is, look at Pakistan. Giving them over a billion dollars, and they continue to harbour terrorists that turn around and kill our soldiers —that’s never okay. We shouldn’t even give them a dollar until they correct it. Use the billion dollars. That’s not a small amount of change,” she alleged. She said Pakistan should be told “you have to do these things before we will even start to help you with your military or start to help you on counterterrorism”. The relations between the two countries have deteriorated since last year and the top leaders of both countries have been engaged in intense war of words in recent months. U.S. President Donald Trump has on many occasions alleged that Pakistan wasn't doing enough to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries while Pakistan's Prime Minister has maintained that Pakistan has gone out of its way in 'war against terrorism'. A few days ago, PM Khan, noticeably exasperated, said Pakistan won't be fighting anyone else's war now and it won't be a 'hired gun', in response to Trump's appeal to Pakistan to help in bringing peace to Afghanistan.
