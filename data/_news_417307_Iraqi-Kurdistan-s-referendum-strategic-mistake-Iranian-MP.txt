TEHRAN - Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said on Tuesday that independence referendum in the Iraqi Kurdistan region was a “strategic mistake”. In an interview with IRNA in Damascus, Boroujerdi called on the Kurdish officials to boycott the referendum and provide a stable and secure atmosphere. Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region held independence referendum on September 25. Kurdistan’s President Masoud Barzani turned a cold shoulder to international calls to call off the referendum.
