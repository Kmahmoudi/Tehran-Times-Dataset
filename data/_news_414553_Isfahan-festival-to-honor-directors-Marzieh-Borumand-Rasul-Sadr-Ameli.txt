TEHRAN – Veteran directors Marzieh Borumand and Rasul Sadr-Ameli will be honored with lifetime achievement awards at the 30th International Film Festival for Children and Youth, secretary of the event Alireza Rezadad said.
 He made the remarks in a press conference held at the Film Museum of Iran on Saturday.  Borumand is most famous for her hits “Grandmother’s Home” and “School of Mice”, two popular puppet series from the 1980s.  “I’m Taraneh, 15”, “Waiting for a Miracle” and “The Girl in Sneakers” are among works by Sadr-Ameli.  Rezadad also said that a commemoration ceremony in honor of Abbas Kiarostami and film producer Ali Moallem has also been arranged at the festival.  “There are no plans to divide the festival into two separate festivals, however the films for children and young adults will be judged separately,” he added.  A number of workshops have also been arranged on the sidelines of the festival, Rezadad said.  “Shadmehr Rastin and Mohsen Damadi will be holding screenwriting workshops, while Shahram Mokri is due to hold a filmmaking workshop for children,” he added.
