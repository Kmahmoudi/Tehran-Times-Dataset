TEHRAN- A philanthropist from the city of Meybod, central province of Yazd, has donated 9 billion rials (around $215,000) for giving interest-free loans to the underprivileged people, IRNA reported on Saturday.  The anonymous benefactor made the donation to Velayat Relief Fund that gives financial aids to the financially struggling people, Reza Zare, the Fund’s director announced. Velayat Relief Fund was established in May 2015 by Imam Khomeini Relief Committee to serve solely as the provider of interest-free loans to the poor, covering the expenses of education, marriage, employment and medical care as well as helping the ones convicted with unintentional crimes.  In the first half of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-September 22), 1,123 interest-free loans were granted to both people supported by Imam Khomeini Relief Committee and others who needed financial aid, said Zare.  Last year, Velayat Relief Fund provided 3,022 people in need with 177 billion rials (around $4.2 million) worth of loans, he added.
