TEHRAN – Over 140 tour guides from 35 countries on Wednesday embarked on a three-day sightseeing in Iran ahead of the 17th World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations convention, which will be held in Tehran from Jan. 28 to Feb. 1. The tour guides are scheduled to visit arrays of natural beauties and historical spots scattered across provinces of Qazvin, Zanjan and Hamedan, CHTN reported on Jan. 25.  The excursion is within the timetable of the WFTGA convention. “The event is of high national and global importance so we must seize the opportunity as the guests would remember our hospitality traditions for several years ahead,” Morteza Rahmani-Movahhed, the deputy director of Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization said in Dec. 2016. Ancient civilization, fascinating culture, diverse traditional dishes and the famed Persian hospitality are amongst ingredients the Iranian tourism sector relies on.  Iran won the bid to host the 17th WFTGA convention in December 2014, after battling it out with Singapore and Denmark, and winning the required votes from WFTGA member states. The convention is organized by the Iran Federation of Tourist Guide Associations under the auspices of the CHTHO. During the event which also includes variety of tours across the country, the WFTGA members will confer to elect the new board of directors and the host of the 18th convention.
