TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Saturday and said that Iran will not let the Trump regime reach its illegitimate objectives.
 The statement was released as the White House announced on Friday that it will restore all the sanctions against Iran, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The statement said that this action of the U.S. will have less economic consequences compared to the past six months, however, it will be a “big moral decadence and political collapse” for the U.S. “This action alone is violating the JCPOA, the UN Security Council’s resolution, the ruling of the International Court of Justice and also confronting with will of the major countries and ignoring humanitarian, legal and moral principles,” the statement said. It added that the U.S. action showed the international community, especially the U.S. allies, that Washington has no respect for international law and punish other countries, including its allies, for respecting law and their commitments. The U.S. has no “political independence” and just fulfils certain regime’s demands, the statement noted. “It is not clear was is going on in the U.S. domestic policies. The county’s officials have learned nothing from the past and it seems that each president of this country should repeat all wrong policies of the past and reach the same results and experience inefficiency of wrong approaches by himself,” he said.
