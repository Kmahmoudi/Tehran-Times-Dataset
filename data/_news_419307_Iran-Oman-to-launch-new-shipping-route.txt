TEHRAN – A new shipping route between Iran and Oman will be launched in late December. It will connect Iran’s port city of Khorramshahr to the Omani port of Sohar, Trade Promotion Organization of Iran reported, citing Abbas Abdolkhani the Iranian commercial attaché in Oman. The first shipping route between the two countries was put into operation in March 2015 between Iran’s Bandar Abbas and Oman’s Sohar. “Operated by an Iranian privately-owned company, the service will run every two weeks for one year and will be increased in the future,” the official said. In December 2016, Iran and Oman inaugurated direct shipping routes from two Omani ports to the Iranian port of Shahid Bahonar.
