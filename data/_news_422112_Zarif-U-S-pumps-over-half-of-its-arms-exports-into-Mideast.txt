TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has denounced the United States for taking advantage of the conflicts in the Middle East and flooding the region with arms, which end up in the hands of war criminals. In a tweet on Wednesday, Zarif reacted to a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which revealed the U.S. has increased its arms sales by 25-percent over the past five years. “The U.S. pumps over half of its arms exports into our region. The vast majority goes to inexperienced and adventurist leaders who are engaged in war crimes,” Zarif lamented.
