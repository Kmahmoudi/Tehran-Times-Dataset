TEHRAN – Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl on Saturday said the 2015 nuclear deal is the result of multilateral diplomacy and said the U.S. pullout from the deal has undermined mutual trust, IRNA reported, citing Russia Today. “The JCPOA is the outcome of international action and subject to independent verification regime which must be preserved,” Kneissl said, addressing the 73rd session of the UNGA. On May 8, President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA and restored sanctions on Tehran. The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on August 6 and the second batch will be restored on November 4.
