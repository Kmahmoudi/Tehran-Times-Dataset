TEHRAN – The Iranian Navy’s 50th flotilla departed the country’s southern coasts on Tuesday morning for a routine mission in international waters. The Iranian naval fleet, comprising Tonb logistic-combat warship and two destroyers – Naqdi and Bayandor – set sail for high seas as part of regular operations to ensure security in critical maritime zones and protect trade vessels against piracy, Tasnim reported.
