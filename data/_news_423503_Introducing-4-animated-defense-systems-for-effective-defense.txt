TEHRAN- Defense systems utilizing identification technology, weapons, processing and communication units play a significant role in today’s modern military capabilities. Taking a glance at wars and threats in current and past times illustrate that effective defense systems have also been focal points in psychological operations. The Islamic Republic of Iran has emphasized air defense systems for obvious reasons. Ayatollah Khamenei, the Commander-in-Chief of armed forces, underscores this: “The Iranian Air Defense is at the forefront of safeguarding Iran's dignity and existence.” The Supreme Leader has always stressed flexible defense systems, and his strategy has been implemented by the armed forces in the context of designing, constructing and refurbishing Iran’s defensive capacities. The S-200 missile defense system Brigadier General Farzad Esmaili, the current commander of the Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base, on January 12, 2012 at the ceremony of commemorating Martyr Sattari, said the Supreme Leader emphasized the mobile S-200 missile system. Seven months after the presentation of this strategy by the Supreme Leader of the revolution, the first S-200 missile defense system was unveiled. The S-200 is a long-range missile which can hit air targets at a range of 300 kilometers. The S-200 system is 11 meters long, weights seven tons, and has a warhead carrying 217 kilograms of explosives that explodes upon impact. Due to the heavy weight and mass of the missile, the mobility of this system, including radar, missile and the control system, is complicated but it has been thoroughly tested and proven to work. “Sevom Khordad”, the home-made missile system The combination of all the essential components of a defense system such as a missile, fire control system, and radar tracking is among its unique capabilities. It is mobile and subject to changes of defense strategy, as needed, so the enemy cannot easily determine its operation. The system can simultaneously track four targets and shoot eight missiles. It seems that the tactic for Iranian commanders to use this system is due to high mobility and the integration of all systems on a chassis in the context of the “shoot-run” debate. The next point about the missiles is the additional use of 2b fighting missiles. These missiles are very similar to those of the Sam-6 missile and Russian systems, but they have the advantages of an optimal wing and tail design.  “Talash” air defense system The “Talash” missile defense system, designed for high-altitude combat clashes, can search and track various targets that can be eventually destroyed by a missile from the “Sayyad” family. This system consists of several components: missile launcher, search and tracking radar, fire control, command and control cabin and monitoring units. The “Sayyad-3” missile, launched in July, 2017, is the latest member of the Sayyad rocket family. “Kamin -2” is the newest missile defense system in Iran The “Kamin-2” missile system was unveiled as the newest missile system in our country during the current year's military parade in Tehran. This missile system, which is in fact a portable and upgraded “Mersad” missile system, is capable of combating drone and unmanned aerial bombers at low altitudes. The system features a missile named “Shahin” which is capable of destroying targets at a distance of 45 to 50 kilometers, and the missile's guidance system is “Fire and Forget”. All components are portable in the “Kamin -2” defense system. Along with the above-mentioned defense systems, which are the most important defense weapons of the country with air mobility platforms, other systems such as Raad, Tabas, Herz 9, Toor M1, etc., also have the ability to enhance the organization of air defense of the country. Due to the increasing proliferation of anti-radiation weapons in the world, the mobility of defense systems is crucial for effective protection of Iran.
