TEHRAN - Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC)’s second-in-command, warned on Friday that any war against Iran will lead to annihilation of the Zionist regime of Israel.
 Salami made the remarks while addressing worshippers in Tehran. "Let me speak to the Zionists. We know you well. You are highly vulnerable. You have no depth. Neither is your reserve as big as our ‘Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas’. “You have no way to escape. No way but to wade the sea. Do not trust your airbases. They are within range and will be soon shut down. Do not assure yourselves on account of the U.S., France, or the UK. They may arrive when you are no more. So mind your behavior and do not make dangerous calculations,”  He added Iran’s missiles are ready to be launched. “Hands are on the trigger and missiles are ready and will be launched at any moment that the enemy tries to carry out its sinister plot against (our) lands,” Tasnim news agency quoted him as saying.
