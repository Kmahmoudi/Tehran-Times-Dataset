TEHRAN – Robert R. Bianchi, a Professor at the University of Chicago, believes that “single meeting with no defined goals cannot produce lasting improvements in the deeper tensions between Pyongyang and Washington or in the Asia-Pacific region.” Professor Bianchi, who also teaches at the Shanghai International Studies University (SISU), adds that “No country trusts Trump’s pledges or intentions. World leaders don’t expect him to maintain the same position on any issue from one day to the next.” Following is the complete text of the interview: Q: How can the U.S.-North Korea summit improve relations between the two countries? A: There might be some temporary benefit in halting insults, but a single meeting with no defined goals cannot produce lasting improvements in the deeper tensions between Pyongyang and Washington or in the Asia-Pacific region. Q: Is there an expectation that the summit may lead to North Korean denuclearization and sanctions relief?  A: Denuclearization is not even a remote possibility despite the insincere rhetoric on both sides. Sanctions relief is always negotiable and easily reversible. Q: With respect to Trump's withdrawal from JCPOA, how much can we trust any possible deal between the U.S. and NK? Is it possible that the next U.S. president will walk away from this agreement too?  A: No country trusts Trump’s pledges or intentions. World leaders don’t expect him to maintain the same position on any issue from one day to the next. Q: How can the warming ties between the U.S. and NK affect Pyongyang's relations with China and Russia? A: North Korea hopes that China and Russia will provide greater economic and political support if Pyongyang can cultivate influence with Trump. All three countries believe they can weaken Washington’s credibility with its traditional allies in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
