During the said period, the government could gain 1.98 quadrillion rials (about $44 billion) of revenues, of which 797.7 trillion rials (about $17.7 billion) were tax income. Some 721.6 trillion rials (about $16 billion) were earned from divesting capital assets, the share of oil revenues stood at 718.5 trillion rials (about $15.9 billion), the report added. Offering financial assets let the government gain 607.2 trillion rials (about $13.4 billion). Iran gained some 526.4 trillion rials (about $11.7 billion) of tax income during the first seven months of the current Iranian calendar year (ended on October 22, 2017), Tasnim news agency reported in mid-December, 2017. According to the report, the Iranian government could manage to collect $12.6 billion of the total 689.2 trillion rials (about $15.31 billion) anticipated to be earned in the said period.  The gained tax income registered a 2.7 percent growth in comparison with the same time span in the preceding year.  As planned the government is to collect 1.16 quadrillion rials (about $25.7 billion) of tax income by the end of the present Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2018).
