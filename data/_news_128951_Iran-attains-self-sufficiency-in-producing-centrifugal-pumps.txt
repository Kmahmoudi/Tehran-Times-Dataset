According to the reports released on Monday, as these centrifugal pumps are being used in the water treatment installations of the power plants, and also with regards to the fact that the high prices of the relevant spare parts have created lots of problems, the Iranian researchers decided to offer Iranian pumps to the domestic markets. The 200-23 and 250-29 pumps of Iran Pump Company are now being used instead of the British and South Korean pumps. Zargan Power Plant is under the management of Mostazafan Foundation (MF). This power plant produced some 2,020,794 megawatts electricity last year. With its two 145 megawatts steam units and four 32 megawatts units, Zargan Power Plant plays a significant role in adjusting the voltage of the electricity network in Khuzestan Province.
