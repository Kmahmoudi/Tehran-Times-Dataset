Hours later, the Intelligence Ministry also issued a statement stating that in a complicated operation six more persons who “provided support for the terrorist criminal team" had been apprehended. A terrorist attacked pilgrims in the Shah-e Cheragh shrine on October 26.  The attack took place at evening prayers. The Daesh Takfiri terrorist group claimed responsibility for the savage act. The heavily-armed terrorist killed 15 pilgrims, including a woman and three schoolchildren, and wounded at least 30 others. According to police chief of Fars province, the gunman started mowing down at everyone within the shrine. Security personnel injured the offender and then arrested him.
