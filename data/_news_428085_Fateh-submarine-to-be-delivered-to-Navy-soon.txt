TEHRAN – Navy Commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi said on Monday that the Fateh submarine will join the Navy’s fleet on November 28, noting Fateh will be a “surprise” for the enemies of the Islamic Republic. “After the Fateh submarine, we are building the Fateh 2 and Fateh 3 submarines, and God willing, working on a heavier submarine is on our agenda,” Defa Press quoted Khanzadi as saying. He also hailed Iran’s self-sufficiency in producing military products, saying before the Islamic Revolution, Iran was dependent on military equipment bought from Western countries, particularly the U.S. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
