Speaking to the participants in the Conference on Islamic Unity who have come to Iran from various parts of the Islamic world, Tehran-based ambassadors of Islamic countries, heads of the three branches of the government and a large audience, the Leader said that the birth of the holy Prophet (S) was the dawn of divine blessings in the fields of teaching, self-purification, guidance, and material and spiritual progress of man in history. Unfortunately, the Islamic ummah over the centuries due to losing sight of real Islam, internal differences, and domination by alien powers has not achieved the objectives set by the holy Prophet (S), he said. Despite the backwardness of the Islamic world in the past, today, the great movement of Islamic awakening and return to Islamic principles which guides the Muslims toward dignity and Islamic identity has begun, the Leader stressed. The Islamic awakening is in the interests of Islamic countries, he said, adding that the Islamic Revolution of Iran was a clear example of restoration of dignity. Through reliance on the Islamic teachings, Imam Khomeini was able to restore dignity to the country and put an end to the long years of dictatorship and foreign domination, the Leader noted. Referring to the opposition of the enemies of Islam to the Islamic awakening spearheaded by the United States, the Leader said the U.S. is evil incarnate and Satan. The atrocities in Palestine and tragedies in Iraq are a historical and political laboratory for the Islamic ummah to take lessons from, he said, adding that the U.S. through the slogan of democracy and freedom, supports the crimes of the Zionist regime in Palestine and with the same slogans deprives the Iraqi people of their inalienable rights. Referring to the justifications of the U.S. for their attacks on Iraq, that is, Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction, he said the question now is: Who supplied the chemical and other sophisticated weapons to Saddam's regime? The main objective of the United States in equipping the Baath Party was to confront the Islamic Revolution and the Islamic awakening. Force will not be able to stop the Islamic awakening in the world, he added. Pointing to Imam Khomeini's distinction between the American and Mohammadan Islam he said the American Islam is ossified and is intermingled with superstition or is an Islam which has been adapted to the American principles which is supported by the West. The Islamic ummah can have a bright future by holding fast to the Mohammadan Islam, which is monotheism, unity among Muslims, and resistance against the arrogant powers, noted the Leader. Speaking before the Leader, President Mohammad Khatami congratulated the Muslims on the birth anniversary of the holy Prophet (S) and Imam Sadeq (AS). He said the best way to confront the enemies of Islam is emphasis on the illuminating path Imam Khomeini offered and holding fast to Mohammadan Islam as well as unity among Muslims and intertwinement of religion and politics in human life. Parochialism in understanding Islam as well as disunity among Muslim nations and governments as well as the threat of great powers are among the dangers ahead of Muslims today, the president said.
