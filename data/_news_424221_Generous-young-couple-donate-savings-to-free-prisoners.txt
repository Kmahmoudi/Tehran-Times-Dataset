TEHRAN – A young couple in Tehran donated as much as 2.34 billion rials (nearly $55,000) of their savings to free 13 prisoners who had committed involuntary crimes, IRIB reported on Thursday. The couple referred to Goftegoo Park’s donation booth, northern Tehran, on June 5, and made the contribution to free prisoners who had committed involuntary crimes, Manouchehr Rahmani, the director of Tehran’s office of Blood Money Organization, explained. The philanthropist couple preferred to stay anonymous, Rahmani added. Since the beginning of the current [Iranian calendar] year (March 21), more than 70 prisoners who have committed unintentional crimes have been released in Tehran, Rahmani remarked, adding, last year, Tehrani citizens helped free more than 1,006 prisoners in the capital. During the holy month of Ramadan, a special booth in Goftegoo Park receives people’s donations and contributions, he stated. Also people can refer to Tehran office’s website www.tehipro.ir to get more information, as well as how to send donations and help release prisoners, Rahmani concluded.
