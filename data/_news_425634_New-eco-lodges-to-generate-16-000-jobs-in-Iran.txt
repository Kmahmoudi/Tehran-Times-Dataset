TEHRAN – Building new eco-lodges will create some 16,000 jobs in Iran, the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization’s director has said. The organization aims to launch 2,000 new eco-lodges by 2021, CHHTO director Ali-Asghar Mounesan added. On May 13, government spokesman Mohammad-Baqer Nobakht pledged support for ecotourism by providing loans to applicants seeking to build eco-lodges. Iran has a very diverse nature where sightseers may even stay with a nomad or rural family or enjoy an independent stay to feel its rustic routines, agriculture, wildlife as well as traditional arts and culture.
