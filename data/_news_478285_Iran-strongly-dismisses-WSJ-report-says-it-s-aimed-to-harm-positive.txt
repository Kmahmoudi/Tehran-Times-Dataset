TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman on Wednesday reacted to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that Iran is about to hit targets inside Saudi Arabia, saying such baseless allegations are intended to undermine the “growing positive” process in relations between the Islamic Republic and regional Arab countries. “Such prejudiced reports by certain Western and Zionist circles are intended to create a ‘negative atmosphere’ against Iran and harm the ‘ongoing positive process’ with regional countries,” Nasser Kanaani said. He said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue its policy of good neighborliness based on mutual respect within the framework of international principles and regulations and it will seriously continue to establish and promote stability and security in the region through constructive ties with neighbors.” Quoting Saudi and U.S. officials, in a report on Tuesday Wall Street Journal claimed, “Saudi Arabia has shared intelligence with the U.S. warning of an imminent attack from Iran on targets in the kingdom, putting the American military and others in the Middle East on an elevated alert level.”  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
