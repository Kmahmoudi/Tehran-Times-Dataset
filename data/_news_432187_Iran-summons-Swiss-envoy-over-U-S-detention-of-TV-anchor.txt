TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Tuesday that Iran had summoned Swiss Ambassador to Tehran Markus Leitner over the U.S. detention of Iranian TV anchor Marzieh Hashemi.
 The Swiss embassy in Tehran represents U.S. interests in Iran. Hashemi, 59, was detained at St. Louisâ€™ Lambert International Airport on January 13 and then taken by the FBI to Washington. On Saturday, a U.S. federal judge said Hashemi, who works for Press TV, has not been charged with any crime, but has made two appearances in District Court, NPR reported. She is expected to be released when she completes her grand jury testimony. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
