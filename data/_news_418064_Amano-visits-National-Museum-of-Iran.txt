Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, paid a visit to the National Museum of Iran on October 29, 2017. He toured various sections of the museum including the ones dedicated to prehistoric, ancient, and Islamic-era Iran as well as countless archaeological objects that chronicle the country’s juicy history.  Accompanied by several senior officials, Amano also visited a Tehran-Yerevan joint exhibit titled “Armenia and Iran: Memory of The Land”. “I am very pleased to find the objects that are similar to those in Shosoin Temple. This shows a long-standing good relation between Iran and Japan, my country,” he wrote in the memorial book of the museum.  On the same day, Amano also held talks with President Hassan Rouhani, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and some other officials.
