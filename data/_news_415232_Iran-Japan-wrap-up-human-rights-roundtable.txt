TEHRAN – Iran and Japan wrapped up the 12th round of human rights negotiations in the capital Tokyo on Thursday. The forum provided an opportunity for the two sides to study bilateral human rights consultations as well as human rights ties in relevant international bodies.  The previous session was held two years ago.  Relations between Japan and Iran have gathered momentum particularly after the signing of the nuclear deal in 2015 between Iran and six world powers of the U.S., Russia, China, France, Germany, and England.  PA/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
