TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that the Israeli prime minister is trying to distort history, calling on him to study history and the Jewish Bible.
 In a meeting with Russian President Putin in Moscow on Friday, Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Persia made an attempt to destroy the Jewish people that did not succeed nearly 2,500 years ago, today there is an attempt by Persia’s heir, Iran, to destroy the state of the Jews.” Larijani said “apparently, [Netanyahu] is neither acquainted with history, nor has read the Torah.” He added Netanyahu “has distorted the Iranians’ pre-Islam historical era and attempted to misrepresent events. Of course, nothing more than presenting such lies is expected from a wicked Zionist.”  Larijani also called Israel as the main culprit behind the bloody conflict in Syria, saying the main reason behind all the crises in the Middle East region is to defeat the “axis of resistance” in order to pave the way for a total dominance of the Zionists. Larijani said Netanyahu’s comments in the meeting with Putin proved the fact that the Syrian war does not benefit the Muslims, and that Israel is behind the conflict in Syria. Larijani called on the Islamic countries to find the truth behind regional crises. During his meeting with Putin, the Israeli prime minister claimed that there could never be peace in Syria as long as there was an Iranian presence there. “We discussed at length the matter of Iran, its objectives and intentions in Syria, and I clarified that there cannot be a peace deal in Syria when Iran is there and declares its intention to destroy Israel,” Al Jazeera quoted Netanyahu as saying shortly after his meeting at the Kremlin.
