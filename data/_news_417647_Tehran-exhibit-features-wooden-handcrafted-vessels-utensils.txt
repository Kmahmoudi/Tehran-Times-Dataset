TEHRAN – A patchwork of wooden vessels and utensils, handcrafted by Iranian artisan Sajjad Badkoubeh, has been put on show at the headquarters of the Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization in Tehran. “High-density wood pieces have been used for making the dishes and vessels,” Badkoubeh who is a native of Gilan province told Mehr on Sunday, adding, finishes of all the products are free of any chemicals. “The woodcutting process has been done completely in a traditional style using an ax and without the intervention of machineries.”   The exhibit will be running until October 18. It features over 200 workable products such as bowls, plates, spoons, trays, disposers and other forms of utensils. Over the past couple of years, dozens of high-quality Iranian handicrafts have been honored with the UNESCO Seal of Excellence.
