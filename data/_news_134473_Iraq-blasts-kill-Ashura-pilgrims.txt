Police said a bomb left in a rubbish bin in the centre of Khanaqin, a mainly Kurdish town north-east of Baghdad, killed at least 13 people. People had been gathering at a local religious hall for ceremonies marking the death of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson in the 6th Century. An hour later, a suicide bomber struck in Baladruz, killing at least 23. Police said they were worshippers gathered outside a Shia mosque in the Dur Mandali area of Baladruz, east of Baghdad, when the man wearing a bomb vest detonated himself. Ashura, the most important Shia festival, has witnessed serious sectarian violence since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Peaceful town Both Khanaqin and Baladruz lie near the Iranian border northeast of Baghdad. The area is ethnically and religiously mixed with a population of Kurds, and Sunni and Shia Arabs. More than 90 people are reported wounded in the two bombings. There are other reports of gun attacks on Shia pilgrims, resulting in injuries. Police spokesman Idris Muhammad said the casualties in Khanaqin were Kurdish Shias, who make up the majority in the city. Most of Iraq's Kurdish minority are Sunni Muslims, but some are Shia. The city has seen serious violence before - a bombing 14 months ago that killed more than 70 people. Police described Baladruz as normally a peaceful town. An estimated two million pilgrims have gathered in Karbala, south of Baghdad, for Iraq's main Ashura rituals, which are to mourn the death of Imam Hussein, the Prophet Muhammad's grandson. There are no reports of violence there. Security measures have been especially strict there, with several thousand extra police and troops deployed. It is the first Ashura since Sunni extremists bombed an important Shia shrine in Samarra last February, sparking an upsurge in sectarian violence.
