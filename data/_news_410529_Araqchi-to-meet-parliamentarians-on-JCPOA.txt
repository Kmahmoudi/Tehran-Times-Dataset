TEHRAN – Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will attend a session of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee in the coming days to discuss the status of the implementation of the JCPOA, the committee’s spokesman said on Saturday.

 The meeting is necessary considering the anniversary of the JCPOA implementation and a recent Foreign Ministry report on it, Hossein Naqavi Hosseini told Tasnim. He said the meeting had been set for last Thursday, but was postponed because Araqchi was in Vienna on that day. SP/PA
