TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi dismissed on Tuesday the UN General Assembly human rights resolution, saying it is politically motivated.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran dismisses the resolution on the situation of the human rights in Iran which was issued at the 71th UN General Assembly session by Canada and its allies and consider it unacceptable. Unfortunately, this resolution has been issued without considering realities in the Islamic Republic of Iran and simply based on selective approach pursuing certain political motivations,” Qassemi said. The spokesman also condemned the abuse of human rights by certain countries. “The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns any instrumental and political use of human rights by the Western countries against the independent countries of world,” he said. He added, “The UN human rights’ mechanisms should not be used as tool for the major powers’ political games and some countries’ hostilities towards others.” The resolution against Iran is in line with serving the interests of the Zionist regime, Saudi Arabia and some other countries in the Middle East region which have no democracy and incite terrorists and spread violence. The UN General Assembly’s Third Committee approved five draft resolutions on Tuesday, four of which pertained to human rights situations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Syria, Iran and Crimea. The resolution call for “greater accountability for human rights abuses and for the Iranian Government to ensure transparent and inclusive presidential elections in 2017”.
