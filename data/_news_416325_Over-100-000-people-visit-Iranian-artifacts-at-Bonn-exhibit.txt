TEHRAN – A total of 118,140 museumgoers visited “Iran, Ancient Culture between Water and Desert,” an exhibit of loaned Iranian artifacts which opened on April 13 in Bonn, Germany, ISNA quoted National Museum of Iran Director Jebreil Nokandeh as saying on Monday. Hosted by the Art and Exhibition Hall of the Federal Republic of Germany -- Kunst und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland – the showcase came to an end on August 20. According to the German museum, the exhibit opens up a window onto a country that has been inaccessible for decades and whose imagery is little known in Europe. Nokandeh said all the artifacts will be back home within two weeks. The event represented 446 objects some of which associated with the Achaemenid era (c. 550 –330 BC) and Bronze Age Iran.
