TEHRAN - Amir Rastegari, managing director of the Defense Ministry’s Marine Industries Organization, said on Sunday that domestically-manufactured Qadir-class submarine has been armed with subsurface-to-surface missiles.
 “The submarine has in the past 10 days been equipped with subsurface-to-surface missiles and enjoys a good anti-surface capability,” Fars news agency quoted him as saying. He said that Iran is capable of mass-producing and exporting Qadir submarines. Rastegari added a unique periscope has been mounted on Qadir submarine and that a number of industrial countries have sought to purchase this periscope and optical system from Iran.
