TEHRAN – Tehran Province’s chief justice has said that former banker Mahmoud Reza Khavari is still able to file an appeal against the verdict against himself. Khavari, a former banker involved in the 2011 massive fraud, was sentenced last month to long-term imprisonment. He was tried in absentia on November 21 and was found guilty of disrupting the economic, monetary and banking system. Speaking to Mehr on Saturday, Qolamhossein Esmaili said since Khavari is not in Iran, he has a two-month deadline to file an appeal. MH/PA
