TEHRAN - In a message of condolence on Saturday, President Ebrahim Raisi expressed his deep grief over the cowardly assassination of a prominent Sunni cleric in the border province of Sistan-Baluchestan. Raisi urged security forces to immediately identify the culprits and bring them to book. Senior Sunni cleric Molavi Abdulvahed Rigi was kidnapped on Thursday and was later found dead. He was the Friday prayers preacher of Imam Hussein Mosque in Khash. He was also a seminary teacher. Mehdi Shamsabadi, the province’s prosecutor, said the cleric was present at his mosque on Thursday, but unknown individuals called him from the rear door, making him sit in a car that had no license plate, according to Press TV. Shamsabadi said local forces had been mobilized to find the whereabouts of the cleric since Thursday, but his dead body was found on the roadside in Khash County. The cleric was hit by three bullets, said the prosecutor, adding the bullets came out of his head. The official also said the police are investigating the case to detect and arrest the perpetrators. In a Sunday message, Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf also expressed his condolences over the cleric’s assassination and said intelligence and security apparatus should immediately identify and punish the perpetrators. The cleric played a leading role in thwarting enemies' plots to sow discord among Shia and Sunni Muslims and promoting dialogue among religions, Qalibaf added. On Saturday, Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei ordered the judiciary chief of Sistan-Baluchestan to make serious efforts in cooperation with intelligence, security and police forces to identify and arrest those who carried out the assassination. In his message, Mohseni-Ejei said the enemies of national unity have failed to achieve their sinister and evil goals and implement the plots hatched by arrogant powers against Sistan-Baluchistan.
