In fact, the U.S., Britain, France and Germany have agreed on partitioning mission of weakening the Islamic Republic. INSTEX lacks locomotive engine too,” Amir Abdollahian wrote on his Twitter account, the Persian language website of Sputnik reported on Saturday.   He added “Iran needs an act to conduct fundamental reform” in view of “sanctions and economic terrorism atmosphere.” INSTEX - Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges - is supposed to be a financial channel and a special mechanism for transferring money in spite of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
