TEHRAN – The new U.S. sanctions against Iran are “destructive” and will be “obstructive”, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters on Wednesday.

 He said Iran has objected to the introduction of new sanctions in a protest to the 5+1 group, ILNA reported. Zarif also confirmed that a Saudi aircraft had entered the Iranian airspace.  He added the captain decided to head back to Saudi Arabia after Iran’s air defense dismissed his reroute request. SP/PA
