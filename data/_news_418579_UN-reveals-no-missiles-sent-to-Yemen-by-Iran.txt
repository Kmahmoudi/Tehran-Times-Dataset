A panel appointed by the UN Security Council sent a confidential letter to diplomats on November 10 questioning evidence presented by the Saudi-led coalition that the missile fired on November 4 was connected to Iran.
 “The Panel has seen no evidence to support claims of SRBM [short-range ballistic missile] having been transferred to the Houthi-Saleh alliance from external sources in violation of paragraph 14 of resolution 2216,” The Intercept reported on Friday. “Analysis of the supply route options by land, sea or air identifies that any shipments of the large containers used to ship and protect the missiles in transit would stand a very high chance of being interdicted in transit by the Saudi-Arabia-led [sic] coalition forces or the Combined Maritime Forces naval forces deployed in the region. No such interdictions have been reported to the Committee in accordance with the requirement to report arms or arms related material seizures in accordance with paragraph 17 of resolution 2216,” the panel’s brief said. Saudi Arabia accused Iran of supplying Yemen with the missile which was intercepted by the Saudi Air Force in midair over King Khalid International Airport in the Saudi capital Riyadh on November 4. Iran categorically dismissed the allegation. U.S. President Donald Trump also claimed on November 5 that Iran is behind the missile launch. In response, Islamic Revolution Guards Corps chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said Trump has “many absurd” things against Iran and this one is like others.
