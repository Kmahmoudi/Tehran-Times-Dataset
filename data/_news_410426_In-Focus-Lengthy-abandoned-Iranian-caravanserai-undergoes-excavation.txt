A combination photo depicts archaeological associates excavating ruins of the historical Kaj Mohammad Abad Caravanserai near Qom, central Iran, on January 21, 2017. Iran’s Research Institute of Cultural Heritage and Tourism leads this season of scientific excavation that was launched on December 21, 2016 and will be running through January 29. Earlier research conducted by the Iranian Center for Archaeological Research in 1985 indicates that the mudbrick caravanserai dates back to early Islamic era and had been in use from Seljuk era (1037–1194) until end of the Safavid epoch (1501–1736). The inland routes across the Silk Road were heavily dotted with caravanserais, the then road inns and guest houses, which provided services for merchants, their caravans and quadrupeds.
