TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that the U.S. is seeking to cause division between the people and the establishment, suggesting strong links between the people and the system to neutralize the plot. “Enemy’s plan is to cause division and separation between the people and system which shows their stupidity, because they do not know that the Islamic republic system is nothing but the Iranian nation and these two cannot be separated,” Leader said in a ceremony held for the cadets graduated from the Imam Hussain Academy.   The Leader urged the officials to raise awareness to protect national integrity given the enemy’s plot to cause rift between the people and the system. He also noted, “Surrendering will definitely cost higher than resistance... and achievements in resisting are hundreds of times more than cost of surrendering.” “Iranian nation’s hatred towards the U.S. has been deepened.”He attached great importance to “patience” and “piety” to counter the enemies’ plots. “Patience” and “resistance” are required to reach causes of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Khamenei added. The Leader also described “national confidence” and “the people’s influence on all affairs of the country” as elements of the Islamic republic’s power. The real power should be based on “independence” and “freedom”, he noted. He said that the U.S. has spared no efforts to take “evil” actions against Iran but could not do a damn thing and this proves that Iran is a powerful country. Ayatollah Khamenei also said that the U.S. has formed a regional coalition to counter Iran. “The U.S. has increased animosity towards Iran due to the Islamic republic system’s power and progress, however, the Iranian nation’s hatred towards the U.S. has also been deepened,” he said.
