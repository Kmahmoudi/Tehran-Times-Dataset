TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that the U.S. “wickedness” in the 1953 coup is now noticed in Iran’s nuclear issue and defense capabilities.
 “Imperialist wickedness is seen in another forms in the issues of Iran’s nuclear program and defense power,” he said in an open session of the parliament. The U.S. and Britain jointly orchestrated the 1953 coup against the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mossadeq after he succeeded to nationalize oil industry. Larijani noted that the Iranians will follow the right path and foil all the plots through unity and under the guidance of Leader of the Islamic Revolution. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran.  The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on Monday, August 6. The second batch will be restored on November 4. This came despite the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency has issued many reports each time confirming Iran’s commitment to the terms of the nuclear agreement. Some analysts argue that Washington has a hidden agenda behind its pullout from the UN backed nuclear accord. They cite Trump’s choice of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state and John Bolton as national security advisor are proof that he seeks regime change in Iran. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif censured the U.S. government for setting up a team to ramp up pressure against Iran, saying it is yet another plot, similar to the 1953 coup, to overthrow the Iranian government. “65 years ago today, the U.S. overthrew the popularly elected democratic government of Dr. Mossadegh, restoring the dictatorship & subjugating Iranians for the next 25 years. Now an ‘Action Group’ dreams of doing the same through pressure, misinformation & demagoguery. Never again,” Zarif tweeted.
