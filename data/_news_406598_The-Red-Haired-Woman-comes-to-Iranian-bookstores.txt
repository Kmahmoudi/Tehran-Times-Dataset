TEHRAN – A Persian version of Turkish Nobel Prize-winning author Orhan Pamuk’s “The Red Haired Woman” has recently been published by Hoonaar Publications in Tehran. Translated by Roya Purmanaf, the book is the story of a well-digger and his apprentice who are looking for water in the barren lands around Istanbul in mid-1980s. In the inner layer, the story compares two fundamental myths of the West and the East respectively: Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex (a story of patricide) and Ferdowsi’s tale of Rustam and Sohrab (a story of filicide). Published in February 2016, “The Red Haired Woman” is Pamuk’s tenth novel.
