IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said on Monday that all signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly called the nuclear deal, should continue abiding by their commitments in order to make implementation of the agreement sustainable.
 According to the JCPOA, Iran must slow down its nuclear activities and instead all nuclear related economic and financial sanctions against the country be terminated. “In the coming months and years, the continuing strong commitment of all parties will be needed to make implementation sustainable,” Amano told the IAEA Board of Governors. the IAEA website quoted Amano as saying at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. Following is part of Amano’s statement posted on the IAEA website: Mr Chairman, You have before you my report on Verification and monitoring in the Islamic Republic of Iran in light of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), regarding Iran’s implementation of its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. It summarizes the verification and monitoring activities that the Agency has conducted under Security Council Resolution 2231 and relevant Board resolutions. These activities are consistent with the Agency's standard safeguards practices. The report presents the facts in an objective and factual manner and includes relevant information which the Agency can share with Member States. We are in the early stages of a process which requires constant and careful attention from all stakeholders. All stakeholders have worked to make implementation possible. In the coming months and years, the continuing strong commitment of all parties will be needed to make implementation sustainable.  Activities have continued under the Additional Protocol to Iran's Safeguards Agreement, which Iran is provisionally applying, pending its entry into force. Since my last report, the Agency has conducted complementary accesses to sites and other locations in Iran under the Additional Protocol. I will continue to keep the Board informed.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
