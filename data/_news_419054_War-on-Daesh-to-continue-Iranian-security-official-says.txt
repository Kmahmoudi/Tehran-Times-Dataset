TEHRAN - Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said on Monday that cultural and military fight against Daesh will persist.
 “Constant and comprehensive fight should be continued to eradicated roots of Daesh ideology which is being supported by some regional countries,” he said during a meeting with Humam Hamoudi, the head of Iraq’s Islamic Supreme Council and the country’s first deputy parliament speaker. Shamkhani said that the Iraqi people proved that it is possible to overcome security threats through reliance on people rather than trusting foreign powers. He also appreciated the Iraqi parliament for its effective role in confronting moves to disintegrate the country, an indirect reference to efforts to partition the northern Kurdistan region from the mainland Iraq. The top security official said as a neighbor Iran attaches great importance to maintaining unity in Iraq and protecting the country’s territorial integrity. For his part, Hamoudi praised Iran’s role in fighting terrorist groups in the region. He also said that Iraq will continue fighting terrorists with the help of its “true allies”. Armed forces in Syria and Iraq, backed by Popular Mobilization Units and Iranian military advisors, have managed to flush Daesh militants out of their last strongholds in both countries, declaring full victory over the notorious group.
