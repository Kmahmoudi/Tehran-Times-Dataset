U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday warned that Washington will not certify the “ill-conceived” Iran nuclear deal, reiterating a previous threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw from the deal unless it is fixed.  “The Iran nuclear deal is a disaster and the United States of America will no longer certify this ill-conceived agreement,” Russia Today quoted Pence as saying in an address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. “Unless the Iran nuclear deal is fixed, President Trump has said the U.S. will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal immediately,” he added.
