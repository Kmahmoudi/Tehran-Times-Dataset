TEHRAN – Terrorism continues to threaten the world although ISIS is losing territory, a senior Iranian security official said on Wednesday.  “Although the most powerful terrorist group, Daesh, has been vanishing over the past two years and has lost most of the territory it once seized in Iraq and Syria, the threat of terrorism has not been reduced in the world,” Ali Shamkhani told the International Meeting of High Representatives for Security Issues in Russia.  The summit started on Tuesday and would last until Thursday, with issues of global information security and fight against international organized crime high on the agenda. Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said any attempt to obliterate terrorism will demand its fertile grounds to be “eliminated” and “extremist thought” rectified.  “We should target in on fountainheads of disseminating terrorist thoughts and dry up them. “On the other hand, we need to address its political, social, economic, and technological factors.”  Shamkhani also reiterated that Iran’s ongoing provision of military advisory support to the Iraqi and Syrian armies was taking place at their respective governments’ request. Acting on Damascus’ plea, Iran has been cooperating with Russia to push back terrorists in Syria.  This, he said, has helped inflict serious losses on terrorist camps, separated them from the ranks of the armed Syrian opposition, and eventually contributed to the conclusion of last year’s ceasefire with the opposition. The official concluded his remarks by urging action against the terrorists’ attempts to establish their reign over the cyberspace.
