TEHRAN- A 36-member Malaysian commercial delegation will start its four-day trip to Iran next Monday to hold talks with Iranian companies and officials from Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA). The Malaysian delegation, as IRNA reported on Friday, is headed by Dzulkifli Mahmoud Chief Executive Officer of Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE) and is comprised of directors and representatives of 27 private sector companies. The visit comes a week after Malaysian foreign Minister Anifah Aman's journey to Tehran last Tuesday where he met President Hassan Rouhani, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh. In his meeting with Zarif, Aman called for expansion of ties between the two countries in various spheres, especially economy. For his part, Zarif said that Iran and Malaysia have always had “good relations” and Tehran has no limit to expand ties with Kuala Lumpur. “Relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Malaysia have been good and forward moving from a historical point of view and the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to expand all-out cooperation with Malaysia,” Zarif said.
