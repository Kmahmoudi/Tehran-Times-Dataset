Regretting the fact that the real image of Iranian women has been distorted by Western news media in the world, Ms. Shojaei said that women of the world have to familiarize themselves with the true status of Iranian women if the stereotype is to be removed. She said that Imam Khomeini's efforts to raise the rights of Iranian women and his profound views on women's rights have greatly elevated the status of Iranian women. The Iranian presidential advisor blamed current and past injustices committed against women in different countries of the world on the performance of governments and people in general, and termed restoration of women's rights in Iran as one of the achievements of the Islamic Revolution. She cited the presence of Iranian women in the cabinet, the Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majlis), universities, city councils and other arenas of social life as clear examples of the level which they have achieved in the recognition of their rights. According to Shojaei, the Islamic code of dressing (hijab) for women is a means of meeting their personal need for decency and security, adding that observing hijab in an Islamic community is but a means of giving respect for regulations. She stressed that Iranian women in Islamic hijab are actively present in all political, social, scientific and sports scenes at the domestic and international level. Observance of hijab, she added, not only would not restrict their active participation in international fora but, rather, would raise their confidence. As for the implications of the policies of political factions on the scope of freedom of women in social activities, Shojaei said political groups in Iran highly value women's status in society, terming differences in opinion in this respect as very limited. On the possibility of women's access to the post of president in Iran, Shojaei said although merit is the deciding factor in this respect, a woman in the position would not be the solution to the country's entire problems. However, she further remarked, laws should not place any impediment on the way of women who wish to rise to the post. Shojaei has already conferred with Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan in which she elaborated on the achievements of Iranian women in various social fields and expressed the determination of the Islamic Republic to uproot illiteracy in the country. The presidential advisor, who heading a woman delegation for an official visit, arrived in Amman on Monday. She also conferred with Princess Basmah bint Talal, president of the National Union of Jordanian Women. The two sides exchanged views on issues related to involvement of Iranian and Jordanian women in social affairs as mandated by Islamic laws and values adhered to in their respective countries. Shojaei and Bint Talal, a sister of the late Jordanian monarch King Hussein ibn Talal, stressed the importance of exchanging visits between Iranian and Jordanian female delegations, saying they contribute to the cause of promoting the role of Muslim women in regional and international fora, IRNA reported.
