TEHRAN - Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, chairman of the Expediency Council, said on Sunday that the spirit of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, has created an international trust and proved that Iran does not seek to harm international community.
 The JCPOA, commonly called the nuclear deal, proved that all the propaganda campaigns against Iran’s nuclear technology were wrong, the veteran politician noted. He also said that the JCPOA is more beneficial to Iran compared to the 5+1 group (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany). On the advantages of the nuclear deal, Rafsanjani said now Iran can sell enriched uranium and heavy water. Iran and the six major powers finalized the text of the JCPOA in July 2015. The nuclear agreement went into effect in July 2016. NA/PA
