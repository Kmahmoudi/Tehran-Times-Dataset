He stressed the existence of various fields for economic relations between Iran and Russia and said, "Russia's economy is a large economy and this country has about $260 billion in imports, so we, as Russia's neighbor, can provide some of the goods it needs and have our share of the market of this country.” “Our relations with Russia are mostly in political, security and defense fields, and on the other hand, due to the mutual economic potential that exists, economic relations between the two countries should undoubtedly be developed and expanded”, the ambassador further stressed. As previously announced by the chairman of Iran-Russia Joint Chamber of Commerce, Iran’s exports to Russia have increased 20 percent during the first quarter of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-June 20, 2020). Hadi Tizhoosh Taban has said that the growth in the exports indicates that the coronavirus pandemic has not affected trade between the two neighbors.

To have multilateral cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union (EUEA) in the framework of Russian President Vladimir Putin's initiative to create the customs "Green Corridor" in coronavirus and post-coronavirus periods is among the main agenda of development of economic relations, the ambassador said. During the talks, the two sides exchanged views about fostering customs cooperation and solving some problems for the Iranian lorry drivers.
