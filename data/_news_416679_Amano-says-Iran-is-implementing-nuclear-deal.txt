Yukiya Amano, chief of the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency, reconfirmed on Monday that Iran is honoring its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 Speaking at the seasonal meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors in Vienna, Amano also said the body under his leadership is continuing to “implement the Additional Protocol in Iran”.
  
Additional Protocol allows surprise inspection of nuclear sites. Amano said the IAEA is conducting its inspection of Iran’s nuclear activities in “an impartial and objective manner”. According to the nuclear deal, Iran is obliged to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of financial and economic sanctions. The IAEA is tasked to monitor Iran’s compliance with the agreement. A reconfirmation of Iran’s nuclear compliance is another blow to U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley and her chief Donald Trump who have been seeking to downplay Tehran’s loyalty to the international deal negotiated between Iran, France, Germany, Britain, the European Union, China, the U.S., and Russia.
 
Following is Amano’s statement published by the IAEA website: My report on Verification and monitoring in the Islamic Republic of Iran in light of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) covers the verification and monitoring activities that the Agency has conducted in the last few months. The Agency has been verifying and monitoring the implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action since JCPOA Implementation Day in January 2016. The IAEA is conducting its inspection of Iran’s nuclear activities in “an impartial and objective manner”.
We fulfil this role in accordance with the modalities set out in the JCPOA, consistent with the Agency’s standard safeguards practices, and in an impartial and objective manner. The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented. The Agency continues to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material declared by Iran under its Safeguards Agreement. Evaluations regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran remain ongoing. We will continue to implement the Additional Protocol in Iran, including carrying out complementary accesses to sites and other locations, as we do in other countries with additional protocols.
