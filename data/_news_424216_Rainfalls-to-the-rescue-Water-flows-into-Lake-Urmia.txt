Following the recent spring rainfalls water has flowed into Lake Urmia, the “the turquoise solitaire of Azarbaijan”. Lake Urmia, located in the northwestern province of West Azarbaijan, used to be the largest salt-water lake in the Middle East and a home to hundreds of bird species as well as a popular tourist destination for those who took advantage of the therapeutic properties of the lake. The 30 billion cubic meters of water stretching over some 5,000 square kilometers has now shrunk to half its size with nearly 2 billion cubic meters of water.
