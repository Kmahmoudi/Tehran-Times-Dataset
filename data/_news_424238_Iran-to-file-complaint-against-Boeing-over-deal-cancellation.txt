TEHRAN – An Iranian lawmaker said the Islamic Republic plans to file a complaint with relevant international bodies against Boeing after the U.S. airliner unilaterally canceled its deal with Iran. “Such an act (by Boeing) will not undermine our resolve and they cannot harm us in this way,” Taqi Kabiri said on Friday, Tasnim reported. A Boeing spokesman said on Wednesday that “we have not delivered any aircraft to Iran, and given we no longer have a license to sell to Iran at this time, we will not be delivering any aircraft.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
