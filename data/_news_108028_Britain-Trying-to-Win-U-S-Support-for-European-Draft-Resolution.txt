Diplomats attending the IAEA meeting believe that the talks between Straw and Powell will produce a positive outcome. In the serious talks between the members of the IAEA Board of Governors, the third European draft resolution has undergone some changes and there will probably be some more changes, the Mehr News Agency correspondent in Vienna reported. Diplomats said these changes were made due to pressure from the United States and its allies Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan. India and South Africa, which have a rather more independent view on Iran’s nuclear program, talked with IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei in order to resolve the issue.
