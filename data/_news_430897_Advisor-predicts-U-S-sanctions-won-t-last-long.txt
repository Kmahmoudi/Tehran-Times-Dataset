TEHRAN – The new round of the unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran cannot last for long because sanctioning all of the countries that are willing to cooperate with Iran is impossible for the United States, a senior advisor to the president said on Wednesday, the Borna news website reported. “The U.S. is alone in [imposing] sanctions and has not been able to engage the world and create a consensus against Iran, and as a result, many countries that were in favor of Iran sanctions in the previous round (prior to the JCPOA) are now unwilling to impose sanctions against Iran,” Hesamoddin Ashna commented. Ashna further emphasized that those countries are seeking to challenge Washington’s economic hegemony in the world.
