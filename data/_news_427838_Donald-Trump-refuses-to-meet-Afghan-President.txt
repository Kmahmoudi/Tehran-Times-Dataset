TEHRAN - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has reportedly cancelled his visit to New York to attend the UN General Assembly (UNGA) session after Donald Trump refused to meet him, said a media report. An official in Afghanistan’s ministry of foreign affairs (MoFA) was quoted saying by Pajhwok Afghan News that it was expected that President Trump and President Ghani would meet on the sidelines of the UNGA meeting in New York. He said a delegation in this regard recently visited the U.S., but President Trump turned down the request, saying that Ghani could meet vice president Mike Pence. Afghanistan’s National Security Council spokesman Qader Shah said he was unaware of the development while the President Ghani’s office rejected the claim. Deputy presidential spokesman Shah Hussain Murtazavi said the president was not intending to attend the UNGA meeting. Earlier, chief executive officer (CEO) Dr. Abdullah Abdullah left for the U.S. to attend the 73rd UNGA meeting. Dr. Abdullah, heading a high-level delegation, would take part in the meeting on behalf of the Kabul government, a statement from his office said. Dr. Abdullah will underline the need for countering terrorism and narcotics, and for enhancing regional and international cooperation with Afghanistan in this regard, the statement added. The CEO would explain Afghanistan's preparations for the parliamentary and district council elections.
