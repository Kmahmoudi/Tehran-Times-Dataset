In his speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, Donald Trump left no doubt that as president he is unbelievably reckless, imprudent, irresponsible, impulsive and dangerous.
 The countries’ responsible leaders use the UN podium to present solutions to the pressing international problems but Trump made the world anxious with his extremely hostile remarks against Iran; Also, instead of using the largest international gathering to push for diplomacy to resolve the dispute with North Korea, he said the U.S. would “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies. Of the 193 countries present at the annual UN conference it was only Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team who were smiling when Trump made his debut speech at the UN. After Trump’s rash remarks were over, Netanyahu made a tweet saying, “In over 30 years in my experience with the UN, I never heard a bolder or more courageous speech.” However, one should not be surprised by such reactions because Trump, Netanyahu and other extremists like John Bolton share many things in common. Netanyahu is a bloodthirsty. He has proven this in reality, killing children in the occupied Palestinian territories. The world may also see Trump would leave a legacy of war and destruction though his refusal to abide by the international climate accord is a kind of crime as some scientists believe the consequences of global warming are more dangerous than a nuclear war. On the nuclear deal, which the United States is only one party among seven others, he again said it is "the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”. As a real estate businessman who was miraculously catapulted to the post of president, he looks at international agreements such as the Paris climate agreement and the July 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA), which has been endorsed by the UN Security Council, as commodities or better say residential buildings. He has been repeatedly saying that his country has no benefit in staying in these deals. It is surprising how can a normal president rail against an international agreement at the United Nations which enjoys the backing of the entire world? He called the nuclear agreement an “embarrassment”. Contrary to his remarks, it is Trump himself who is an embarrassment to the great majority of the American people and the large world. It is he who is on the wrong side of history. PA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
