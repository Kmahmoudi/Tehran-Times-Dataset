Iran’s defense chief also said a plot is underway by the hegemonic system to destabilize the region. “Unfortunately, some regional and extra-regional countries do not stop destabilizing acts and are trapped in the U.S. and the Zionist regime of Israel’s plots and seek to disintegrate the regional countries and fuel chaos,” Hatami pointed out. Hatami described the U.S. and Israel as the “most dangerous” supporters of terrorism in the region. Iran uses all its capabilities to help maintain security in the region and protect the regional countries’ territorial integrity, he added.
