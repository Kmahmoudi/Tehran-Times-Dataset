TEHRAN – A former vice president for parliamentary affairs has said Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf will run for presidential post only if all principlist groups concur on him.

 Speaking to Arman newspaper in an interview published on Monday, Mohammad Reza Mirtajeddini said Qalibaf would make the “risk” only in that case. Mirtajeddini said in the 2013 presidential election the principlists had many candidates and that is why they did not succeed.
