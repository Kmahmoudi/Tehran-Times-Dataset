TEHRAN – The Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization has recently launched a social campaign for using domestic handicrafts as gifts to celebrate Noruz, the Iranian New Year. The organization has adopted two mottos, which are literally translated into “Yes to national products” and “I will give handicrafts as gift this Noruz”. “The move requires nationwide participation and we want all handicraft sellers to install posters of the mottos at their stores,” Mehr quoted Majid Mahdavi, a CHHTO official, as saying on Sunday. Perhaps the most enduring image of Noruz is about socializing, deepening family bonds and meeting up with old friends mostly in their homes. Over the past couple of years, dozens of high-quality Iranian handicrafts have been honored with the UNESCO Seal of Excellence.
