TEHRAN- In an effort to create cutting-edge military hardware, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Ground Force has effectively test-launched a new domestic top attack anti-tank missile. General Ali Kouhestani, the head of the IRGC Ground Force’s Research and Self-Sufficiency Jihad Organization, announced on Saturday that the Sadid-365 anti-tank missile, which has an 8-kilometer range and can destroy a variety of armored vehicles, is a noteworthy military development. He pointed out that the optically guided missile, designed and produced locally, has a high degree of pinpoint precision. The weapon is intended to engage targets from above using plunging fire, and can even pierce the active protection system (APS) of tanks and obliterate them, Kouhestani explained. The general stated that in the following stage, the IRGC scientists will enhance the missile and give it new firing control technology and folding wingtips. He said the personnel carriers of he IRGC Ground Force will be equipped with four Sadid-365 missiles, two of which will be mounted on either side of the turrets. The IRGC Ground Force received the ground-launched Almas anti-tank missile on July 7, 2021. The homemade missile is said to be a powerful strike weapon with an 8-kilometer range. The IRGC had previously created an air-launched variant of the Almas missile, which was fired by Ababil-III drones. The armed forces are now self-sufficient thanks to extraordinary advancements made in recent years by military specialists and engineers in the manufacture of a wide variety of indigenous equipment. Iranian officials have emphasized time and time again that the country will never hesitate to improve its defense capabilities, particularly its missile capacity, which is solely intended for defense. Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, has consistently urged actions to preserve and expand Iran’s military capabilities while denouncing foes for casting doubt on the nation’s missile program.
