TEHRAN – In line with the national schemes for reviving sustainable tourism industry, Iran has started creating eight eco camps along the coastline of its southern Qeshm Island located in the Persian Gulf.
 The Qeshm Free Zone Organization (QFZO) in close collaboration with the private sector is implementing the project in a bid to broaden accommodation on the island, the IRIB reported on Tuesday. Farzin Haqdel, the deputy director of the QFZO, anticipated that the camps would be warmly welcomed by travelers to the island, the nature lovers in particular.   The campsites, each with a capacity of about 70 people, are expected to be completed by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017), he added. Residents of provinces such as Kerman, Yazd, and Sistan-Baluchestan consist a majority of the ever-growing travelers to the island, Haqdel explained.
Iran’s Cultural Heritage Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, as the main supporter of the program, seeks to create 10 more eco camps in several other tourist spots across the country, he noted.
