TEHRAN – Numerous energy projects worth over 5.69 trillion rials (about $135.4 million) were inaugurated in three provinces in the 31st week of the Energy Ministry’s A-B-Iran program, IRNA reported. In a ceremony attended by the Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian, projects including the establishment of some electricity transmission lines, some substations, water supply to rural areas, and a small-scale power plant were inaugurated through video conferences in Tehran, Ilam, and Golestan provinces. Of the mentioned projects, eight were put into operation in Ilam province, eight were in Golestan and the other one was inaugurated in Tehran. Water supply to 43 villages was the only project inaugurated in Tehran province, which provided a population of more than 14,000 households with sustainable drinking water. The inaugurated projects of Golestan include a 25-megawatt (MW) small scale generator, modification, and optimization of 28 electricity distribution lines, increasing Gorgan transmission substation capacity, as well as improvement and optimization of stations, transmission lines, and water supply projects to 39 cities and villages.
