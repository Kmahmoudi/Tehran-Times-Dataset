TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif reiterated on Friday that Iran’s four-point plan is still the only viable option to resolve the Yemeni crisis.
 “I said this on the crisis in Yemen in April 2015. Today, after untold human suffering & war crimes by the Saudi coalition & its U.S. accomplices, & efforts to whitewash their crimes with absurd allegations against Iran, our four-point plan still remains the only viable option,” Zarif tweeted on Friday. In April 2015, Zarif submitted a letter to Ban Ki-moon, then UN secretary general, outlining its four-point peace plan for Yemen. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and end of all foreign military attacks, humanitarian assistance, a resumption of broad national dialogue and establishment of an inclusive national unity government. U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook unveiled on Thursday pieces of missiles, rockets, drones and other weaponry at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington D.C., claiming that Iran is involved in supplying the Houthis with weaponry.  Also on December 14, 2017, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley presented a charred tube and other material that she claimed were from an Iranian-made ballistic missile fired from Yemen at the King Khalid International Airport near the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on November 4 of the same year. Houthis are not getting any support from Iran: Hisham Sharaf Hisham Sharaf, the Yemeni minister of foreign affairs, said on Wednesday that Yemenis got their missiles from the Soviet Union many years ago and they are not getting any support from Iran. “I can tell you that we are not getting any support from Iran,” he said in an interview with CNN aired on Wednesday. “If anyone has the documents, satellites, pictures, anything that proves that let them show it to the world. Not to go and see the Scud missiles that we got from the Soviet Union very long time ago and we improved them and try to prove to the world that these are Iranians’ missiles,” he explained.
