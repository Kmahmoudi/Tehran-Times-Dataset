TEHRAN – Iran will start testing its first domestically-made coronavirus vaccine by injecting it to 56 volunteers aged 18 to 50 years on Monday. The candidates must remain in quarantine for a week to a month to show the side effects of the vaccine, IRIB reported. In the meantime, the test results are checked several times for blood and cellular immunity. After the results of the study are determined, the second stage begins with the injection in 500 people, and after 28 days, the third phase begins with mass production. Iranian vaccination by Sept. 2021 Mostafa Ghane'ei, an official with the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology, said that the domestically produced COVID-19 vaccine will probably be injected into the whole population by September 23, 2021. Now that coronavirus vaccines have been developed in the world and the third phase of clinical trials has passed, the possible side effects are almost certain, and Iran will be aware of the side effects which speeds up the process, he noted, adding, “vaccines produced in Iran are the same as those produced in China, India, the United States, etc.” Iraj Harirchi, the deputy minister of health, has said that in Iran, 12 groups are making efforts to develop coronavirus vaccine, three of which have passed the animal testing.
