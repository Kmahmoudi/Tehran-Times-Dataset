TEHRAN – In an indirect criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said terrorism in the name of race and religion has nothing to do with neither of them.
 “Quick to insult Islam but hesitant to condemn racist terror at home. Terror in name of race or religion is plain terror & represents neither,” Zarif tweeted. The remarks by Zarif came after clashes erupted between white nationalists and a group of counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. The clashes were intensified when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person on August 12. Trump put part of the blame for violent clashes on those marching against the white supremacists. An act which was criticized by the U.S. closest allies including British Prime Minister Theresa May. Surprisingly, Trump tweeted on Friday condemning “radical Islamic terrorism” and calling for “tough” position to counter it.  Trump’s twitter message was referring to a terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain, on Thursday which left 13 people and injuring more than 100.
