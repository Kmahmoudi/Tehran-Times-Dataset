TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani reacted strongly to the hostile remarks against Iran by new U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, saying, “Who are you who want to decide for Iran and the world”.
 Pompeo, who was CIA chief until he was confirmed as secretary of state  on April 26, said in a speech on Monday that the U.S. will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic. The harsh remarks by Pompeo came nearly two weeks after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 international nuclear deal. “A person who was at the center of espionage until yesterday and now introduced as secretary of state wants to decide for (others),” Rouhani asserted, adding, “Who are you who want to decide for Iran and the world.” Rouhani said the world cannot tolerate that the U.S. decide for the world through bullying. The president said the Americans have experienced the “remarks” by George W. Bush and noticed their consequences but again a new group has come to power who repeat those “words”.
