TEHRAN – If U.S. President Donald Trump eschews certifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, aka JCPOA, mistrust will emerge, former U.S. undersecretary of state Wendy Sherman said on Saturday.

 Speaking at the New Yorker Festival, Sherman said if Trump decides not to certify the deal and “kick it over to Congress,” the measure could have a negative impact, according to United Press International. “Decertification will have an effect on the trust deficit,” Sherman said.  “There are eight reports Iran has complied with the deal, and it’s a multilateral agreement,” she added. Sherman also raised the point if the U.S. doesn’t certify Iran's compliance “Why, then, would North Korea talk with us?” She had last week said that seeing the Iran deal decertified, North Koreans will infer that the U.S. is not trustable. The New Yorker Festival is an annual event usually held in early October by The New Yorker magazine since 1999. The event brings together big names in arts, politics and some other fields.
