TEHRAN – The older person’s population will grow three-fold within the next 30 years in Iran, as some 700,000 people are added to the aging population of over 60 each year, head of the secretariat national council of the elderly has said. The population of senior citizens currently exceeds 8 million in Iran and the annual growth rate of the country's aging population is about 3.8 percent, IRNA quoted Hassan Salmannejad as saying on Sunday. In developing countries, 80 percent of the population is expected to age over 60 in the next three decades, he added. In 2050, the elderly population will constitute 39 percent of the total population in almost all of the countries, he said, adding that so the elderly must more participate in cultural activities and play a more significant role in the society. Currently, half of the elderly population in country are aging 60-70, who does not need constant care or supervision, he noted. According to the World Health Organization between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12 to 22 percent. By 2020, the number of people aged 60 years and older will outnumber children younger than 5 years old. The pace of population ageing is much faster than in the past.
