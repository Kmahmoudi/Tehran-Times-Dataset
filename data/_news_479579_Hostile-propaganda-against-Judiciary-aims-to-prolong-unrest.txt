TEHRAN – A senior Iranian security official has reacted to criticism against Iran for executing a rioter, saying the enemy’s propaganda in this regard aims to prolong the unrest.  Seyed Majid Mir-Ahamadi, the Deputy Interior Minister for Security and Police affairs, said the people have demanded that the Judiciary to put on trial the rioters and the Judiciary has done so.  He made the remarks in an interview with Fars News.  The security official said the enemy’s propaganda against the Judiciary is natural because they want the rioters to act freely.  He pointed out the implementation of sentences against rioters has caused them to feel that they cannot allow themselves to continue their crimes.  On Thursday, the Judiciary executed a rioter who had blocked Sattar Khan Street in Tehran. The rioter, Mohsen Shekari, was convicted of Moharebeh, according to Iran’s state news agency IRNA.    Following the execution of Shekari, the West leveled huge criticism against the Islamic Republic. They accused Iran of violating human rights, a charge Iran roundly denied.  Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani has condemned the new meddlesome statements of some Western countries and officials about Iran's internal affairs, according to a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry.  Kanaani said just as governments are responsible to "enforce law" and "establish public order", they, including the government of Iran, are also obviously and necessarily tasked with giving an effective and deterrent response to any violation of law and to attempts to create chaos and cause insecurity in the society. He added that Iran, in line with its internal rules and regulations, acts to protect people's rights, security and public order and to prevent crimes. Kanaani noted that Iran stresses its inherent competence in this regard. He maintained that the same governments that resort to violence against the civil and peaceful demands of their own people and officially and publicly order harsh crackdown on demonstrators, are in no position to speak about the Islamic Republic’s actions to enforce its laws and issue court rulings in a completely legal manner in order to deal with flagrant violence and maintain law and order for the Iranian people. He went on to say it’s regrettable that these countries adopted a hypocritical political stance from the onset of the recent developments in Iran and violated international law by overtly and covertly resorting to different meddlesome methods. Kanaani said the western countries instigated and promoted violence against Iran’s integrity and national security under the banner of supporting human rights and women’s rights and are now claiming that they defend the Iranian citizens and are worried about their security. The Foreign Ministry spokesman underlined that many European governments have directly or indirectly violated the human and legal rights of Iranians and even their right to life due to imposition of cruel and illegal sanctions by the U.S. against the Iranian nation. Kanaani added that the sanctions hitting medicines and treatment have caused the deaths of many Iranian citizens. President Ayatollah Seyed Ebrahim Raisi has also reacted to the conspiracy of the enemy against Iran. He said that “the enemy intended to attack the values, the Islamic Revolution and the people in a hybrid war and a new conspiracy, but the vigilant children of the nation stood against this attack, according to a readout put out by the official website of the Iranian presidency. Raisi added, "The enemies wanted to implement the prescription that they had implemented in some countries in Islamic Iran with hollow and deceptive slogans, unaware that here are brave men, women and young people who are standing by the Revolution and their values and country with a sense of responsibility". He said, "The enemy targeted the Revolution and the people in the recent ISIS-like events and displayed the utmost enmity, hatred, and malice towards the value stream and the revolution front." The president said, "Today, if the situation in our cities is calm and we are safe, it is thanks to the blood of dear young people who stood up against the rioters. Although the grief of their loss is very difficult for us, but the achievement of their pure blood was the despair of the enemy."
