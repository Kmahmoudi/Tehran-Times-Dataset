TEHRAN – Any foreign aggression will add more complexity into the Syrian crisis, widening war and bloodshed to the whole region, Iran’s Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan said on Tuesday.   “Any aggressive action against Syria exacerbates the crisis and widens the scope of war and bloodshed and causes violence to continue in the region,” Mehr news agency quoted Dehghan as saying in an appearance with visiting Syrian chief of staff General Ali Abdullah Ayoub.  “Iran will spare no effort to restore stability to Syria,” he further noted, underscoring that the two nations are fighting terrorism in the same “stronghold.”  Iran, along with Russia, backs the legitimate government of Syria in the fight against foreign-backed terrorists.  The meeting comes days after Israel carried out several attacks on a military base near the Damascus airport on Thursday, causing explosions. Iran’s Foreign Ministry condemned the attack as “violation of national sovereignty and territorial integrity” of Syria.   Also, early April, the U.S. launched a military strike on a Syrian government airbase in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of Syrian civilians.
