TEHRAN – France's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the new U.S. sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea appeared at odds with international law due to their extra-territorial reach. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that French and European laws would need to be adjusted in response, adding that discussions would be necessary at European Union level because of the potential impact on European citizens and firms. The House of Representatives voted 419-3 on Tuesday to impose new sanctions on Iran, Russia and North Korea, moving the bill one step closer to President Donald Trump’s desk. The new sanctions could affect European firms. The bill includes sanctions against the Islamic Republic and the IRGC for allegedly supporting terrorism, an accusation Tehran vehemently denies. It also targets North Korea for its missile tests, and aims to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the reunification of Crimea with the Russian Federation. The EU had warned Washington against the measure, as it would adversely affect its new energy deals with Russia. On Wednesday, the European Union warned that it was ready to act within days to counter proposed new U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they would harm the bloc's energy security. "The U.S. bill could have unintended unilateral effects that impact the EU's energy security interests," EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said in a statement. Responding to the new sanctions, the Kremlin described the move as an extremely unfriendly act and sad news for Russia-U.S. relations and their further development. "The attitude to this (law) will be formed on the basis of a thorough analysis, and the decision (on how to respond) will certainly be taken by the head of state, President Putin," Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, told a conference call with reporters. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani also condemned the bill, and vowed to take retaliatory measures against the United States. “We… withstand the pressure and sanctions, and will take reciprocal action,” Rouhani noted.
