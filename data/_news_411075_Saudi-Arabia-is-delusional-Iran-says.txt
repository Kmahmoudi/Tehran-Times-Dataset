TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has said that Saudi Arabia’s stance on Tehran shows that Riyadh does not have information about the Middle East region and Iran.
 “Assuming that Saudi Arabia and Emirates have adopted harsher position on Iran under the influence of Trump’s slogans, I think we should advise them avoid making such historic mistake,” he said in a televised interview with al-Alam aired on Sunday. Given the status of Iran in the region, it is better for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to adopt policies based on the regional “realities”, he added. He noted that establishing “balanced” and “fair” relations with the neighboring and regional countries is Iran’s principled policy. “We are willing to settle the issues with our neighboring countries and we have never initiated efforts to undermine relations with any country,” the Foreign Ministry official remarked. Qassemi added that Iran is ready to enter negotiations with Saudi Arabia if kingdom seeks friendly relations with Iran and make up for previous mistakes. “Saudi Arabia is delusional and is making a mistake. The mistake caused some problems for Saudi Arabia in the past,” he pointed out. He added, “Saudi Arabia cannot continue following this path…”  ‘Trump has not ended his campaign yet’ Given Trump’s rhetoric and position, it seems that he has not yet started his job seriously, Foreign
Qassemi also said U.S. President Donald Trump is still continuing his electoral campaigns. Given Trump’s rhetoric and position, it seems that he has not yet started his job seriously, he said.  It is too soon to see what path Trump will take, he added. Pointing to the fact that the U.S. has adopted hostile policies towards Iran, Qassemi said Trump’s comments are something repetitive. Elsewhere, he said that Iran has always relied on the people in countering the enemies. “Iran is a peace-seeking country and has always been interested in establishing good relations with the other countries under the condition of mutual respect and non-interference in others’ affairs,” the diplomat stated.  NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
