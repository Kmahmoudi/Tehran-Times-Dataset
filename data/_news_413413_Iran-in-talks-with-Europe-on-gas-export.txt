TEHRAN – National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC)’s Managing Director Hamidreza Araqi said Iran is in talks with European countries to export gas to Europe, ISNA reported on Saturday. The official noted that sending Iranian gas to Europe is possible both through pipeline and in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
“Various European companies expressed willingness in this regard but reaching a final deal generally takes near five years,” he added. EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
