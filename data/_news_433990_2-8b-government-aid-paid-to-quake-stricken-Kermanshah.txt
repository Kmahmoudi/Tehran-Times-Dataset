TEHRAN – The government has so far spent 120 trillion rials (about $2.8 billion) to make up for the damages caused by earthquake in the western province of Kermanshah, Esmaeil Najjar, head of the National Disaster Management Organization has said. “Over 104,000 residential units have been destroyed through the earthquake last year, 52,000 of which have been reconstructed,” he explained. He went on to say that some 23,000 quake-affected houses in villages have been retrofitted and provided to the residents, and some 4,000 houses are being reconstructed for the families residing in rental houses.
