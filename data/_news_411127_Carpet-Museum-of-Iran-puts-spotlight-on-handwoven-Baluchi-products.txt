TEHRAN – A total of 28 handwoven Baluchi products crafted by southeastern Iranian inhabitants are on display at the Carpet Museum of Iran. The exhibit, which also embraces kilims and rugs along with variety of indigenous spreads and saddlebags, runs through Mar. 5, Mehr news agency reported on Sunday.  Baluchi rugs are usually all wool, but their material may also include goat and camel hair, cotton for whites, and in some cases a few knots of silk. The knotting is customarily asymmetrical. Patterns of such carpets are highly varied, many consisting of repeated motifs, diagonally arranged across the field. Some present a maze of intricate latch-hooked forms. Covering an area of 3400 square meters, the Carpet Museum of Iran is located on the northwest of Laleh Park in the heart of Tehran.
