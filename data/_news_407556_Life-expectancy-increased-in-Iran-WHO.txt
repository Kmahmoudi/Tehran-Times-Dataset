TEHRAN — According to the figures released by World Health Organization (WHO) Iran’s life expectancy rose to 74 last year from 72 in 2011, ISNA reported on Saturday. In respect of infants’ mortality rate in the last Iranian calendar year (March 2015-March 2016) the number of deaths of children less than 5 years has decreased compared to the past decades and accordingly life expectancy increased. The indices from 2011 indicated that life expectancy increased from 72 to 73 in 2013. The chief reasons behind such an increase are decrease in infants’ mortality rate, sufficiently widespread health care coverage, promoted literacy rate, and creating health care facilities in rural areas. Based on the numbers announced by WHO the infant mortality rate for children below age 5 in 2012 and 2013 were 18 and 17 deaths per 1,000 live births respectively and the rate for children below age one were 15 and 14 deaths per 1,000 live births over the same period. In 2013, some 98 percent of the infants were given vaccination for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT), tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, and hepatitis.
