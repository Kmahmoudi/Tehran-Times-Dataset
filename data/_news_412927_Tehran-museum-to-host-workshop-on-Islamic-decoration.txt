TEHRAN â€“ Malek National Library and Museum Institution in downtown Tehran will hold a workshop on gereh-Sazi (literary: making knot) from April 29 to May 1. Skilled artisan Saeid Shakuri is set to train know-how of the craft that creates intricate geometric designs using wood stripes or other substances to adorn buildings in the Islamic architecture. Gereh-Sazi, also called girih-chini, refers to two related techniques of woodworking: either a lattice frame, which could be left plain or filled with wooden insets, colored glass, or other materials and was used for balustrades and window screens; or a mosaic panel, composed of hexagons, stars, and other geometric shapes and used to decorate the mosques, palaces, and private houses.
