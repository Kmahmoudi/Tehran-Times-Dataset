TEHRAN - The climate change is real and it is illustrated by the heat wave conditions spreading like a plague in India and Pakistan. According to a new research, it can have dangerous consequences in these two countries in near future. In 2015, India and Pakistan experienced heatwave conditions that ended up killing over 3,600 people in just three months. The history might repeat itself, says a new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body set up in 1988. If average world temperatures increase by between 1.5ºC and 2°C, potentially deadly heatwaves are likely to substantially increase (pdf) in frequency, and those similar to the one in 2015 could become an annual occurrence in India and Pakistan, says the report, putting coastal cities such as Karachi and Kolkata at high risk. The landmark report, released in South Korea on Monday, was compiled by a team of 91 authors from 40 countries following the 2015 Paris climate agreement, in which policymakers from around the world, including India and Pakistan, agreed to work towards limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C. The IPCC report reveals the widespread effects of global warming of 1.5°C and above, which includes increased coastal flooding and the salinization of river beds, besides increased heatwaves. And the south Asian region, where millions of vulnerable people live and work outdoors, is especially at risk for all of this, it says.
