TEHRAN - First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Tuesday that the U.S. will not reach its objectives if Iranians maintain unity and integrity.
 Inaugurating several major infrastructure projects worth $690.2 million in south of Kerman province, Jahangiri said it is true that the country is in a difficult situation due to U.S. sanctions but the Iranians will overcome problems through reliance on domestic capacities and proper planning. “The Iranian nation will defeat sanctions by relying on domestic capacities and capabilities,” he said. Enemies should know that sanctions cannot affect Iran, the vice president added. “We should not underestimate ourselves, because Iran is a great country with many capacities,” he remarked. Jahangiri noted that the U.S. has waged economic war against Iran, however this will reach nowhere. He said that the U.S. has spared no effort in taking actions against Iran during the past 40 years, however, it has not been successful and Iran has always followed the path of progress. Elsewhere, he noted that Iran should fight corruption, support private sector and provide opportunity for competent managers. The pragmatic vice president also said it is a duty to create “bright prospect” for the youths. “Today, the three branches (of government) and political, academic and economic intellectuals have the mission of boosting hope in the society,” the vice president stated. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. In an interview with the European Council on Foreign Relations published on January 11, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that the EU is working with the rest of the international community to keep alive the landmark nuclear agreement.
