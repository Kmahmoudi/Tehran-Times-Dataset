TEHRAN – The Workers’ Party of Algeria has condemned the Arab League’s anti-Iran statement, saying Iran is not the enemy of Arabs, but imperialism and the Zionist regime are the enemies of the region’s nations. In a statement, the Workers’ Party said it is regrettable that the Arab leaders condemned Iran instead of the Zionist regime in their meeting in Dhahran, IRNA reported. It further said such acts would lead to the continuation of aggressions against Muslim nations, adding that Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia, are safeguarding America’s interests in the region.
