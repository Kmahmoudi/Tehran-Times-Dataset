TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Velayati, the senior foreign policy advisor to the Leader, said on Tuesday that Iran is against disintegration of the countries in the Middle East and counter any attempt in this respect.
 “We are against any move that will lead to disintegration of the regional countries and will stand against this kind of actions which are detrimental to the region,” he said during a meeting with Hervé Morin, the former French defense minister. From geopolitical and geostrategic points of view the situation in the West Asian region is “volatile”, said Velayti who was Iran’s foreign minister from 1981 to 1997.  He also said expansion of cooperation between Iran and Iraq can prove very effective in helping establish peace in the region. For his part, Morin said that fighting terrorism in the region is impossible without the involvement of Iran. He also attached great importance to the nuclear deal between Iran and the six major powers (the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany), saying it benefits international peace and security. Kamal Kharrazi, the head of Iran’s Strategic Council, also met separately with Morin on Tuesday. Kharrazi said the nuclear deal has provided opportunities for cooperation between Iran and the 5+1 group. He, also foreign minister from 1997 to 2005, said that Iran is a stable country that can play an important role in helping establish peace and stability in the Middle East. The former French official said that no problem in the region can be resolved without Iran, adding Iran is playing a “key role” in the Middle East. He also said the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, will revive regional diplomacy and cooperation with Europe. The nuclear agreement went into effect in January 2016. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
