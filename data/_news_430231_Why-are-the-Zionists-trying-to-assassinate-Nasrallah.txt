TEHRAN - The Zionist military commanders, who are in pain over their recent defeat in the occupied territory of Palestine and in Syria against the Islamic resistance group, have called for assassination of Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, the General-Secretary of Lebanon’s Hezbollah. General Roei Leivi, a Zionist military commander, in an article in Maarkhot which is a Zionist publication has emphasized the need of assassination of the Hezbollah leaders, particularly Nasrallah.   Assassination policy on the Zionists’’ agenda  This is not the first time that the Zionists have spoken of the need for the assassination of the resistance leaders as the Zionist publication, Walla, had previously published a report on Tel Aviv’s projects to assassinate Nasrallah and other resistance leaders in Lebanon.  Walla wrote, “Amir Peretz, former Zionist Minister of Defense in 2006, called on Israeli security and intelligence agencies to hand over Nasrallah's case to him as well as his hiding places to examine the possibility of his assassination. Surprisingly, Peretz never found much on Nasrallah.  It is clear that assassination of Islamic movement leaders has always been the Zionists’ policy; however, they have failed in fulfilling their policy as Walla has already acknowledged.   Illusion of breaking the fighting spirit of Hezbollah   One of the illusions of the Zionists over the assassination of resistance leaders in Lebanon, with Seyed Hassan Nasrallah on top of the list, has to do with their illusion over breaking the fighting spirit of Hezbollah. This is while the assassination of any of the Hezbollah leaders, be it in the battle field, in Lebanon or in Syria, not only hasn’t had any impact on the movement but has increased their determination to gain more victories and confront the Zionist enemy and their-backed Takfiri terrorists.  A clear example of such achievement is Syria where after over 8 years of crisis, with backing of resistance group and the undeniable role of Lebanese Hezbollah, 90 percent of the Middle East country has been liberated from Takfiri terrorists. That is exactly why the Zionists stress the withdrawal of Hezbollah form Syria.   Fear of the strategic plan of resistance Seyed Another issue is that the Zionists know full-well that Nasrallah is determined to take back the Golan Heights from the Zionists. The Zionists fear raises as more areas in the southern part of Syria, which sits close to the Golan Heights, gets clear from the Takfiri groups. Abdullah Atwan, the famous writer and analyst of the Arab world says, “Seyed Hassan Nasrallah's strategic decision to reopen the occupied Golan Heights front has made the Zionist authorities nervous so much so that the Hebrew language media are shouting for the assassination of Seyed Hassan Nasrallah.”   The Zionists frustrated at the superb resistance military power The other frustrating issue for the Zionist commanders is the superb military power of Hezbollah. According to reports, Hezbollah has at least 150,000 advanced missiles that can penetrate and hit strategic locations of the Zionists.  In addition, during the 33-day war in 2006 Hezbollah's Islamic resistance forces gained valuable experience in the ground combat field that when in need, they can use the viable option against the Zionist enemy. Al-Yaum newspaper writes, “Therefore, Seyed Hassan Nasrallah proved for a thousand times that he is a man of his word. This man showed that he knows no lies and does not say anything but the truth. This man is not afraid of martyrdom, but according to what we have heard from his followers, he believes that he has lived more than he should’ve and his martyrdom has been delayed.
