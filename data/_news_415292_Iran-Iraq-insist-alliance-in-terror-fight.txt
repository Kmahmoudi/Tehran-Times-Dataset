TEHRAN – In a press release on Saturday Iran’s Defense Ministry announced that Iran and Iraq are allies in the fight against terrorism. The announcement followed after Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan and his Iraqi counterpart Erfan al-Hiyali held talks in Tehran on Saturday afternoon.  Al-Hiyali was visiting Iran 20 days after the Iraqi forces succeeded to wrest control of the city of Mosul which had been captured by Daesh terrorists in early 2014. On July 3 Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally announced the liberation of Mosul. Divisive moves not acceptable Dehqan said Iran considers security in Iraq as its own and will continue supporting the Iraqi government and people in their endeavor to establish peace and security. Iran’s defense chief also said Iraq’s integrity will guarantee the interests of all Iraqi ethnic groups.  “Divisive moves in Iraq are not acceptable for the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Dehqan said in an open reference to a plan by the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to hold an independence referendum in September.  International consensus needed to uproot terrorism Iran’s defense minister also pointed to efforts being made by the U.S., the Zionist regime of Israel and their regional allies to destabilize the region, saying an international consensus is essential to eradicate terrorism. Dehqan also described liberation of Mosul as a “great national achievement” for Iraq. For his part, al-Hiyali praised Iran’s support for Iraq in fighting terrorism. He also highlighted the importance of expanding military cooperation between the two countries. Al-Hiyali also lauded amity between the Iraqi people and army, saying this sense of empathy has empowered the Iraqi Army in countering the threats. Iran provided advisory help to the Iraqi security forces in their three years of war against Daesh militants in Iraq who were mainly composed of terrorists from different countries as well as former Baathist officers loyal to Saddam Hussein.  In their first months of capturing certain Iraqi cities and villages Daesh militants committed despicable crimes against people.  NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
