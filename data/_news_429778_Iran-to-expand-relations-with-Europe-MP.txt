TEHRAN - Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh said on Tuesday that Iran will continue expanding ties with European countries.
 “Europeans are killing time while Iran is waiting for mechanisms to expand economic relations with them,” he said during a meeting with Dragan Todorovic, the Serbian ambassador to Tehran, according to Iran Students News Agency. Falahatpisheh said Iran attaches great importance to solidarity among Iran and Europe. He added that the U.S. sanctions on Iran will not affect Tehran-Belgrade ties. Elsewhere, he said that the 2015 nuclear deal proved Iran’s rightfulness. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of nuclear agreement in May and reintroduced sanctions on Iran. However, the Europeans have so far failed to announce the so-called special purpose vehicle (SPV) because of the U.S. pressure.  The special purpose vehicle is a payment mechanism proposed by the European Union with the intention to protect trade with Iran in spite of U.S. sanctions.
