TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Iran has no fight to pick with the American people, stressing that “Death to America” chants mean death to President Donald Trump, national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “The U.S. regime is the embodiment of evil, violence, creating chaos, and warmongering. The U.S. regime has always lived off trespassing to fulfill its interests. The U.S. is the embodiment of evil, then they complain why we chant ‘Death to America’,” Ayatollah Khamenei said in comments at a gathering of Air Force officers. “As long as the United States shows viciousness and savagery, the Iranian nation will never cease shouting the words ‘Death to America’,” he said, according to the khamenei.ir. The Leader also warned Iranian authorities against trusting the Europeans, saying, “In the matter of nuclear negotiations, I had already said that the U.S. officials are not reliable. Today, the officials, who accepted to negotiate, admit that the Americans are not reliable.” “These days, there is a discussion concerning the Europeans and their proposals. My advice would be that they should not be trusted, just like the U.S. cannot be trusted,” he added. Ayatollah Khamenei stressed that taking cautionary steps when dealing with Europe does not imply cutting ties with those nations. “Even now, regarding Europe, I am not calling for cutting ties with them. However, the point I am trying to make here is about trust.” “Protesters on the streets of Paris are attacked, to the point that some have lost their eyes. Then they brazenly demand that we observe human rights. Do they even know what human rights is? Neither today, nor in the past, and never throughout their history, have they recognized what human rights is,” he noted.
