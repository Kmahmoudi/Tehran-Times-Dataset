The UN Security Council issued a resolution on December 23 that imposes sanctions on Iran’s trade in nuclear material and technology. “Resolution 1737 is in fact designed to bring Iran’s talks with the European Union to a dead-end so that Washington can hold talks with Tehran through diplomatic approaches as the only opponent,” Rezaii told the Mehr News Agency. Through making the situation more complicated, the U.S. seeks to change the direction of negotiations from the EU to the United States so that it can take control over Iran’s nuclear dossier without the Europeans, he observed. “By leading the efforts to issue the resolution, the U.S. cheated China and Russia. In fact it isolated the two countries from negotiations by making them sign the sanctions.” The EU can help resolve the nuclear problem by returning to the agreements reached between Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani and European Union foreign policy Chief Javier Solana last summer. The situation of Iran’s nuclear dossier will get more complicated in the upcoming months, but not the way the foreign countries say, he said.
