TEHRAN – Over 80 percent of internet content for kids is not safe and appropriate for children in Iran, the secretary of Koodakonline festival said, Fars reported on Wednesday. Seyyed Jamal Hadian exlained that the web content either is not appropriate for children’s age range or is made by foreign developers and is not appropriate for the Iranian culture. The secretariat of the festival has received 1,120 works, of which 638 ones were web series and others were films so far, he said. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Ministry will hold Koodakonline festival on web series and online short films for children in spring 2019. The festival only acts as a facilitator to connect inventors, investors and producers, he said. Sometimes both money and human resource are provided but there is no will to perform the work, he lamented. A total of 20 top ideas in the web series section is selected and the Information and Communication Technology Ministry provide a subsidiary for producing as well as some facilitations like equipment, office, director and animator, he explained.
