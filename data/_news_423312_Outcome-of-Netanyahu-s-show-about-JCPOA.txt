Over the last weeks, the prime minister of the occupying regime of Quds has been hardy struggling to persuade the United States and Trump's government to walk out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). These measures are taking place while in 2015, as the nuclear deal was about to be approved in the US Congress, Netanyahu tried to prevent the final formation and implementation of the JCPOA through the AIPAC lobby.  However, it seems that this time he's especially counting on Trump's presence at top of US political and executive equations. During the 2016 presidential elections, the Zionist Prime Minister clearly announced his support for Republicans and opponents of the nuclear accord, and, on the contrary, expressed his objection to the re-election of the Democrats. By emphasizing his baseless show on the JCPOA, Netanyahu is once again trying to play a direct role on the process of implementing the nuclear deal with Iran (which its case had been closed by the IAEA once and for all). Last week and during a dramatic show, Netanyahu showed some "documents". He argued that according to these documents, Iran has secretly retained the military aspect of its nuclear program, which is against the JCPOA context. However, Netanyahu's claims were not welcomed even inside the occupied territories! Many Zionist politicians have explicitly called Netanyahu's action a baseless show, which is contrary to the interests of the occupying regime of Quds. Neither did the IAEA consider Netanyahu's claims a new story, and consequently, the Zionists' Prime Minister's show ended up in no results. In separate telephone calls with his Australian, Indian and British counterparts, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talked about documents allegedly indicative of Iran's secret nuclear activities. These claims were raised at a time when Donald Trump has not yet made a final decision on the nuclear deal. Many US sources have emphasized that the US president, on the one hand, has a tendency to cancel the nuclear deal, but on the other hand, he is worried about its international costs. Beyond that, the President of the United States has not yet been able to persuade his European allies of a perfect and coordinated play on his ground (in terms of complete withdrawal from the JCPOA). Though some European authorities such as the French President Emanuel Macron, Theresa May the British prime minister, and even the German Chancellor Angela Merkel have in part, acted in the interests of the United States, and spoke of reforming (changing) the JCPOA, but the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA has not been welcomed even by these officials. Â  On the other hand, Trump is seriously worried about the reaction of the Islamic Republic of Iran towards the withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear deal. This concern is increasing day by day. Our country's authorities have explicitly stated that Tehran's response to Washington's withdrawal will be regrettable for the United States. In any case, Netanyahu's recent show and his confrontation to the nuclear deal with Iran was nothing unexpected or even unpredictable. Such measures have been repeatedly taken by the Prime Minister of the occupying regime of Quds. And in the future, we will see more of his political and media campaign against our country. However, the global response to Netanyahu's actions once again showed that the Zionist regime is stepping down towards isolation and collapse in the international system in such a way that even the traditional Tel Aviv allies were not ready to welcome Netanyahu's ridiculous show, and they kept silent about it.
