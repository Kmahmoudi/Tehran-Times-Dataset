Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla and Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani have agreed to step up economic cooperation on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Summit on Margarita Island on Sunday, September 18, 2016. “The moment is right for the two countries to step up economic cooperation,” said Vice President Jusuf Kalla on Monday in a press release of the Indonesian foreign ministry, as quoted by Antara news agency.
Indonesia and Iran continue to explore economic cooperation, such as in energy as well as oil and gas sectors, including LPG supply from Iran and a preliminary study between Indonesia’s state-owned energy company Pertamina and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) to develop two oil fields in Iran.
Meanwhile, President Rouhani has once again invited Indonesian President Joko Widodo to pay a visit to Iran.
The talks between the two leaders will be followed-up by a meeting between Indonesian foreign minister and Iranian counterpart in New York, on the sidelines of the United Nation General Assembly.
In 2015, total trade volume between Indonesia and Iran reached $273 million. Indonesian exports to Iran include palm oil, paper and paper products, textile raw materials, tires, rubber, chocolate powder, coffee beans, cartons and wood products.
