TEHRAN – President Rouhani has hailed the low prices of medicine and medical treatment during his administration compared to those of previous administrations, describing the measures taken by his Health Ministry as a “source of pride”, ISNA reported. Speaking at the 1st National Forum on Health in Tehran on Sunday, president Rouhani said: “Expanding insurance by 11 million people and other measures taken in the field of health are among the government's greatest source of pride.” “Some people seem to be suffering from political Alzheimer's disease and forget the [previous] conditions of treatment, the prices of medicine, and medical equipment,” he noted. He further described healthcare as a very important issue, saying “Health has priority over treatment.” The president also said that medicine is now being supplied to people 20% cheaper and medical equipment 40% cheaper than prior to his administration term. “The most important part of health is to improve [our] culture and lifestyle,” he said, underlining that Islam presents guidelines on how to live healthy. Referring to the dust problem in Khuzestan Province, Rouhani called for serious actions to resolve the situation which has created a lot of difficulties for the province’s citizens. Elsewhere in his remarks, Rouhani criticized the state TV for its stance on his administration. He said: “If meat prices increase for two days, it becomes the top and official news of the television.” “One must not dash people’s hope for the future of the country,” he said. “To solve issues, we need to join hands.” “We rely on God and trust Him, and with people’s support we will continue along the path of the country’s development with all our power,” he said.
