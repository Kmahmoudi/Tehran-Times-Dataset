TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi rejected on Saturday the U.S. State Department report about human rights situation in Iran as “biased” and “politically motivated”.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran considers the U.S. State Department’s annual report, especially claims about the human rights situation in Iran, as biased and politically motivated which portrays an unrealistic and distorted image of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Qassemi stated. Acting U.S. Secretary of State John Sullivan released the 2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices on Friday in which it was claimed that Iran violates the human rights. Qassemi said the accusations made against Iran are “unfounded” and “unacceptable”. He said, “Based on credible international reports, the U.S. government is known as the biggest violator of the human rights in the world and plays an important role in supporting countries which violate the human rights such as the Zionist regime of Israel and certain reactionary countries in the region.” He added, “It is better for the U.S. government to immediately take necessary actions to support human rights inside the U.S. and respond to violation of human rights by its allies instead of interfering in other countries’ domestic affairs and judging situation of the human rights in the world.” NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
