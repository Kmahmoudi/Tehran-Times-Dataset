TEHRAN - Afghan envoy to Pakistan Omar Zakhilwal called on Pakistan’s minister of state for interior affairs Shehryar Khan Afridi on Tuesday and discussed bilateral relations between the two countries. During the meeting, the two leaders agreed that Pakistan and Afghanistan share cultural and historical ties and expressed Islamabad’s desire to resolve outstanding issues and work together for regional peace and stability. “We will have to take collective decisions in national interests of the two countries,” Zakhilwal was quoted in media reports. He later tweeted about his meeting and “delightful conversation”. “Today had a delightful conversation with Pak State Min for Interior, energetic & foresighted PTI leader @ShehryarAfridi1. Among other things we agreed on immediate steps to ease up the follow of people at all crossing points. Looking forward to our constructive future engagement,” he tweeted. The relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan frayed during the previous government in Islamabad headed by Nawaz Sharif. Kabul has repeatedly accused Pakistan of providing sanctuary to militant groups that attack Afghanistan, including Haqqani Network. Pakistan has rejected the charges. Since the formation of new Pakistani government led by Imran Khan, there have been a series of overtures and the both countries have expressed desire to bury the hatchet and open a new chapter in their bilateral ties.
