TEHRAN –National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) has signed 76 deals since the removal of sanctions in January 2016 for leasing out tankers to large foreign companies including European ones, managing director of the company, Sirous Kianersi, announced on Tuesday. Mentioning the effective role of implementing joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) in Iranian oil industry, the official said lifting of sanctions removed the barriers to the international activities of NITC, as the company’s tankers have resumed shipments to the ports in Spain, the Netherlands and other destinations, IRNA reported. He also announced that the country’s fleet of LPG tankers will be developed. One month ago Kianersi had said that NITC is looking at options to place its first orders for new very large crude carriers (VLCCs) in post-sanction era, as it plans to renew its existing fleet. NITC, which operates the largest tanker fleet in the Middle East and has the world’s largest fleet of super tankers, transports Iranian crude and also acts as an independent entity in contracts with foreign concerns for crude oil transportation based on prevailing international freight rates.
