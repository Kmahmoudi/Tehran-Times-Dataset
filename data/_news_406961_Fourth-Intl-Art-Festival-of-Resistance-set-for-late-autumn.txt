TEHRAN – The Fourth International Art Festival of Resistance will be held in late autumn in the four categories of painting, poster, sculpture, as well as cartoon and caricature this year, secretary of the festival Habibollah Sadeqi says. He made the remarks in the press conference held at the Osveh Art and Cultural Center on Sunday. “Due to a lack of budget, the organizers have decided to hold the festival in fewer categories, although we know the photo section will be missed in this edition this time,” he added. He also said that the festival will take place in the Saba Art and Cultural Institute during the last month of autumn in collaboration with the Iranian Academy of Arts. Executive director of the festival Mohammad Habibi also said that works from 70 countries will go on display at the fourth edition of the festival.
