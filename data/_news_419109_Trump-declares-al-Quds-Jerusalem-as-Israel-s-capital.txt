President Donald Trump defied overwhelming global opposition by declaring U.S. recognition of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel and announced plans to relocate the U.S. embassy there.
 "I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel," Trump said from White House's Diplomatic Reception Room. Immediately after the announcement, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif made a tweet saying “al-Quds will remain Arabic-Islamic”.
