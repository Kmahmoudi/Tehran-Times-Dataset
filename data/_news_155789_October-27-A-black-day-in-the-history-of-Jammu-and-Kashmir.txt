The 27th of October is a Black Day not only for the people of Jammu and Kashmir but it also represents one of the darkest chapters in the history of South Asia. On this day 60 years ago, the Indian army marched into Kashmir and forcibly put down a popular uprising of the people of Kashmir against the autocratic and tyrannical Dogra ruler. The violent suppression of the aspiration of the Kashmiris led to an armed conflict between Pakistan and India. The Kashmir issue was taken to the Untied Nations Security Council, which constituted a special commission -- the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan -- with the mandate to independently investigate the matter and help the contending parties reach a negotiated settlement. The most important outcome of the deliberations of the commission were two resolutions passed by the Security Council on 13th August 1948 and 15th January 1949 respectively, calling upon the governments of India and Pakistan to hold a free, fair and impartial plebiscite under UN auspices in order to enable the people of Kashmir to decide whether they wanted to join Pakistan or India. This was followed by commitments on the part of the Indian leadership to allow the Kashmiris to determine their destiny. In a statement to the Indian parliament on 12th February 1951, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru said, “We had given our pledge to the people of Kashmir and subsequently to the United Nations. We stood by it and we stand by it today. Let the people of Kashmir decide”.
