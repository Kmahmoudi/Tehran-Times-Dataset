TEHRAN – The Majlis has urged Pakistan to show more political will in fighting terrorists that use the country’s soil to launch attacks inside Iran, IRNA reported.

 The lawmaker said Tehran understands Islamabad’s problems in controlling its border with Iran but they need to “show stronger political will not allow terrorist groups to use its soil to attack Iran,” said  Ali Najafi Khoshroodi, the spokesman for the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee.  He added that Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and some security officials had attended the committee’s meeting earlier on Sunday to discuss the recent terror attack in the southeastern province of Sistan-Balouchestan that killed 27 IRGC members and injured 13 others.
