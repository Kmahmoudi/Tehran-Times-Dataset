TEHRAN – In an open reference to Saudi Arabia which is famous as the hotbed of terrorism, the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday advised the new Trump administration against selling “dangerous weapons to main supporters of terrorism”.
  The comments by the ministry came upon as Donald Trump took a trip to Saudi Arabia on Saturday and signed a huge arms deal with the Saudis. “Unfortunately, some regional countries rely on major powers instead of relying on their human resources and capacities of regional cooperation,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. The Foreign Ministry official said the Saudi-led war on Yemen has destroyed the Yemeni infrastructure and the “Takfiri terrorist movements” who are backed by Riyadh have also wreaked havoc on Syria. During his trip, Trump claimed that Iran is a key sponsor of militant group, an allegation vehemently rejected by Qassemi. Trump’s “unfounded claims” are in line with spreading Iranophobia to motivate the regional countries buy more U.S. arms, the spokesman noted. The ministry spokesman also called on the U.S. to stop “warmongering” policies in the region. Qassemi also said terrorist are gaining more strength due to the U.S. “hostile and aggressive policies” and “miscalculations by despotic rulers” who support terrorists. He also urged the regional countries to help establish security and peace, respect people’s right to determine their destiny and spend their money on development rather than funneling them into U.S. coffers. Elsewhere, Qassemi said that the only way to counter terrorists is cutting financial and arms supports to them. He also said that the U.S. and its regional allies should be aware of the fact that Iran is a “democratic, stable and powerful” country which seeks to fight terrorism and violence and will not change its path because of the U.S. claims. Zarif says U.S. ‘milking’ Saudi Arabia Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that Trump’s recent anti-Tehran remarks were aimed at “milking” Saudi Arabia. “Iran -- fresh from real elections -- attacked by @POTUS in that bastion of democracy & moderation. Foreign Policy or simply milking KSA of $480B?” Zarif tweeted on Sunday. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
