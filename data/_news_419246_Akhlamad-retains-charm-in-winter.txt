TEHRAN – Though not a water-rich country, Iran still boasts a considerable number of waterfalls and cascades that are fairly popular amongst domestic sightseers. Undoubtedly they are not branded as world’s highest, wildest or prettiest but a feature making them astonishing is that they are in a land with dominating arid and semi-arid plain. The northeastern Akhlamad Waterfall sustains its own charm by simply freezing over in the wintertime. It offers onlookers a magnificent natural view yet challenges rock climbing enthusiasts as well. The 40-meter-high waterfall is named after the adjacent Akhlamad Village, itself distanced about 85 kilometers from Mashhad, the capital of Khorasan Razavi province. Encircled by ranges of rocky cliffs measuring up to 300 meters, the cascade boasts huge amounts of pouring waters due to heavy downpours in the first few months of the spring. Water plunges straight down to a pond beneath where associated fossils and mineral deposits can testify its age. Some experts believe that the history of Akhlamad Waterfall can be traced to the Late Jurassic. The cascade can be reached on an overland journey involving some trekking. Visitors may stay for a couple of hours, relaxing together while breathing fresh air in a countryside known for the abundant fruit trees. Over 300 waterfalls are dotted across Iran with Margoon in Fars province, Latun in Gilan province, Piran in Kermanshah province, and Rayen in Kerman province to name a few.
