TEHRAN - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Ebrahim Raisi over his election as Iranian president, Xinhua reported. In his message, Xi noted that China and Iran are comprehensive strategic partners, and this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic relations. He added that he highly values the development of China-Iran ties, and stands ready to work with Raisi to strengthen bilateral strategic communication, consolidate mutual political trust, and broaden and deepen win-win cooperation in various fields, so as to create benefits for both countries and their people. In March Iran and China signed a 25-year strategic partnership which envisions comprehensive economic cooperation between the two countries. In his first press conference as president-elect on Monday, Raisi said developing ties with China will be on agenda of his administration. China is also party to the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Beijing has been a critic of the U.S. that abandoned the legally binding agreement in May 2018, when Donald Trump was president.
