TEHRAN— Iran’s top diplomat says that so far there have been no direct negotiations between Tehran and Cairo, but Iran has received some messages from Egypt.  “We have not had direct negotiations with the Egyptian side. Egypt is an important country in the Islamic world and the development of relations between Tehran and Cairo is in the interest of both nations,” Amir Abdollahian told the press before leaving Damascus.  “We have not yet had a negotiation for the progress and development of relations directly with the Egyptian side, but some efforts are underway in order to revert Tehran Cairo relations back to normal,” the foreign minister elaborated.  Amir Abdollahian stated, “We now have an office for protection of Iran’s interests in Cairo, and on the other hand, the other side has an office for protection of Egypt’s interests in Tehran. My explanation refers to the fact that Egypt is an important country in the Islamic world and we consider the natural and developing relations between Tehran and Cairo to benefit the two countries, two nations and the region.” On Thursday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein announced that concurrent with Tehran-Riyadh negotiations, talks are underway between Iran and Egypt as well as Iran and Jordan.  Additionally, Hussein pointed out that Iran has come up with the idea of creating channels of communication with the Egyptians.
