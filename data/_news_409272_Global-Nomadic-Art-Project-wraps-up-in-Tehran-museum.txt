TEHRAN -- The Global Nomadic Art Project, which began in the coastal village of Salakh on Qeshm Island on December 5, wrapped up at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art on Sunday, December 18, 2016. The closing ceremony was attended by the head of the project land artist Nadalian, the participating land artists, officials and veteran artists, Persian media reported on Monday. The seventh edition of the project began in South Korea and moved to India and South Africa, and later continued in Iran.  Speaking at the ceremony, Nadalian said that nomadic art can cover many arenas such as writing books or making sculptures, but this project that began in South Korea concentrates on nature and land art. That is, the land artists create a stable environment and avoid any further destruction to nature. “The land artists take no items with them to create their works, they choose whatever they find in nature, leading to creative artworks,” he explained. “Travel is a must in these types of projects and it should take place in different regions, leading to more understanding and friendship,” he remarked. Director of Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art Majid Mollanoruzi said that the museum warmly receives new ideas, especially nature-themed events. “The museum mainly focuses on modern art, but it has hardly paid much attention to contemporary art. These types of events help students become more familiar with contemporary art,” he added. Nine artists from South Korea, Germany, France, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Netherlands and Lithonia in addition to 11 artists from Iran took part in the project. The book “Global Nomadic Art Project”, published by the Institute for Promotion of Contemporary Visual Art was also unveiled during the opening ceremony of the project on Qeshm Island.
