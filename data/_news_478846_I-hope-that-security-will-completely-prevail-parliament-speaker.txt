TEHRAN – Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf has expressed hope that complete security will prevail as the country is grappling with violence by hooligans who are misusing the protests as an excuse to commit acts of terror. Ghalibaf made the remarks on Friday night in a meeting with the family of Rouhollah Ajmian who have lost a son in the protests. The speaker had visited the Rouhollah Ajmian family to sympathize with them. “I hope, through work and efforts, security will be completely established and persons who martyr they youthd” be dealt with “decisively based on law,” Ghalibaf said. Ajmian was martyred by thugs in Karaj on November 3. Ghalibaf went on to say that “we all are indebted to martyrs and our security is indebted to the martyrs.” He added that officials are more responsible toward the martyrs and their families and this makes their duties heavy. The father of Ajmian is a veteran of the Sacred Defense.  Iran’s resistance against Saddam Hussein’s war against Iran in the 1980s is known as Sacred Defense.
