Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri has announced his resignation, media reported on Saturday.
 In a televised address, Hariri said he believes there is a "plot to target his life." The climate in Lebanon is similar to that in the period leading up to his father's assassination in 2005, he added. Hariri was appointed prime minister in late 2016 and headed a 30-member national unity cabinet.  The government has largely succeeded in protecting the country from the effects of the civil war in neighboring Syria.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
