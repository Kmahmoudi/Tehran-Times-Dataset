TEHRAN — The first plasma gasification plant in Iran aiming to convert waste materials to gas will come on stream by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017). Utilizing three plasma torches the plant will be converting one ton of waste materials (household, hospital, etc.) to gas on a daily basis, ISNA reported on Sunday.  A portion of the gas produced in the plant feeds on-site turbines, which power the plasma torches and thus support the feed system. This self-sustaining electric power amounts to some 30 kilowatts. Researchers at the Institute of Petroleum Industry has succeeded in developing the plasma gasification plant which will be of great help in waste disposal. Waste management is one of the biggest challenges Iran is dealing with and based on the most recent researches carried out so far plasma gasification is one of the best options to get rid of the waste. The project at hand is mainly developed by the knowledge-based companies and commercializing this technology is firmly on agenda.
