TEHRAN – The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran’s spokesman has said that “any inspection” of Iran’s “facilities” would be done within the framework of the July 2015 nuclear deal and the IAEA’s protocols.

 U.S. efforts to wring a favorable IAEA report failed when on August 30 the United Nations nuclear watchdog released its most recent quarterly report confirming for the eighth time that Iran is committed to limits on its nuclear program under the nuclear agreement. Speaking to reporters at the Natanz nuclear facility on Saturday, Behrouz Kamalvandi said the IAEA is not permitted to carry out surprise and unplanned inspections of Iran’s facilities. “The norm is that we provide the Agency with certain information that will be verified by the Agency. If there is any ambiguity, the Agency will raise the issue and we will definitely respond to it.”  “They may have some questions that would reinforce suspicion that Iran is conducting ‘unethical’ nuclear activities; in that case they may request inspection,” said the AEOI spokesman. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, met with IAEA officials in Vienna on August 23 for what she claimed a fact-finding mission, which is part of President Donald Trump’s review of the deal Iran made with world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions. On the same day, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif cautioned in a letter to IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano that Haley’s visit was intended to sow doubt about the nuclear agreement. Kamalvandi added, “There is no point of ambiguity [about Iran’s nuclear program] for the Agency, and therefore, no reason to make allegations and wrong assumptions. Everything you hear about Agency’s access to Iran’s military sites is just media hype.” He further stressed that Iran’s nuclear industry is progressing well. “We are advancing our nuclear activities based on our agenda that has already been coordinated with the Agency. Today, our new generation of centrifuges are evolving and will reach mass production in the predicted time frame.” SP/PA
