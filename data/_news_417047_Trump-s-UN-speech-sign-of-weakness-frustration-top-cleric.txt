TEHRAN - Chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council Seyed Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s speech at the UN General Assembly originated from his “weakness, frustration and anger”.
 “Unfortunately, the U.S. president has shown a paradoxical and unbalanced personality so far,” he said in a meeting of the Expediency Council. He added Trump accused Iran of supporting terrorism while Tehran has been a victim of terrorism and has been fighting it in the region. The ayatollah also praised President Hassan Rouhani’s speech at the UN on Wednesday, describing it as “firm” and “very appropriate”. In his speech, Trump accused Iran of engaging in “destabilizing activities” in the region. Trump claimed that Iran’s “support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.” He also said that the 2015 nuclear deal signed by Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council was an “embarrassment” and hinted that he may not recertify the agreement when it comes up for a mid-October deadline. Rouhani, in his UN speech, described Trump’s speech as “ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric, filled with ridiculously baseless allegations”. He added that Trump’s comments “was not only unfit to be heard at the United Nations – which was established to promote peace and respect between nations – but indeed contradicted the demands of our nations from this world body to bring governments together to combat war and terror.” NA/PA
