TEHRAN – An Iranian-Italian cooperative mission on Pasargadae, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in southern Iran, has recently agreed on extending the cooperation for another three years, IRNA reported on Tuesday. The agreement was made between Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization and the Superior Institute for Conservation and Restoration (Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione e il Restauro), which is a body of Italy’s Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism. The ISCR experts and Iranian technicians have worked side by side on the preservation of the Tomb of Cyrus the Great and encircling ruined palaces in Pasargadae. The Institute has considerable expertise in the fields of conservation, restoration and management of cultural heritage by holding specific educational courses and implementing joint projects. The effect of pollution on outdoor artefacts and the territorial information systems for risk prevention are amongst courses it has held for Iranian counterparts.   Situated in about 50km north of Persepolis, itself a World Heritage, Pasargadae was the capital of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great who reigned mighty Persian Empire from 559 to 530 BC.
