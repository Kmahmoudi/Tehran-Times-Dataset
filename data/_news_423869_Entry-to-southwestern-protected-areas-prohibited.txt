TEHRAN — Considering the beginning of wildlife breeding season in Kohgiluyeh and Boyerahmad province’s protected areas, southwestern Iran, people are banned from entering the region, the provincial chief of the department of environment has said.  “Stricter conservation measures have been taken for the protected areas in the province where wildlife, including goats, are reproducing,” Tasnim news agency quoted Mohsen Ja’fari-Nejad as saying on Wednesday.  "In order to safeguard the wildlife, wildlife protection forces monitor and control the areas round the clock,” he explained. Ja’fari-Nejad stated that visiting these sensitive areas is banned till the end of the breeding season. During this period, the province wildlife protection forces will be more vigilant than ever and patrol the area carefully to protect the areas and poachers will be severely punished. Once a newborn animal is separated from the mother on their first days of birth, the mother will suffer from breast abscess (lactation mastitis) and the newborn will not grow properly due to the lack of proper nutrition, Ja’fari-Nejad said. Any hunters or individuals who take action on separating newborns from their mothers will be handed over to the authorities, the official warned.
