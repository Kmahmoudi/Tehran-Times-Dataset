TEHRAN — The 11th Tehran Organic Week Festival, aiming to increase public awareness about healthy food and fruits, kicked off on Thursday at Tehran’s Goftogu Park, Mehr news agency reported. 
 The 10-day event is attended by 120 domestic producers of organic products.  Saeed Rad, managing director of Tehran Fruit Markets Organization affiliated to the municipality, said on Thursday that organic products are costlier than the other products and such events would pave the way for encouraging the public to choose these healthier products despite their price.  The event also puts spotlight on buying organic products for Yalda Night celebrations this year.  Shab-e Yalda (Yalda Night), which falls on December 21, is known as the longest and darkest night of the year, and marks the last eve of autumn and the beginning of winter. Guests are usually served with nuts and fresh fruits such as watermelon, pomegranates, and persimmon.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
