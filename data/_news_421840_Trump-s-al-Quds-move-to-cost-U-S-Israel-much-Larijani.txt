TEHRAN - Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s move in relocating the capital of Israel to al-Quds (Jerusalem) will come at a high price for the U.S. and the Zionist regime of Israel.
 “The decision that was taken about The Noble Quds was not accepted and was despised by all Islamic countries. It is not obvious if they can implement this project easily, because the decision will cost them much,” Larijani told reporters. Trump declared on December 6, 2017 that he recognizes al-Quds as the capital of Israel and ordered the relocation of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds. Larijani underlined how Trump sees the destiny of the U.S. and Israel intertwined and even sacrifices the U.S. interests in the benefit of Israel. “Such moves will prove unwholesome to them, because there are many factors and elements each playing a role in the region,” he noted. He expressed hope that the Palestinians would be successful and al-Quds would be liberated from the Zionists. On December 21, 2017, the United Nations General Assembly delivered a stinging rebuke to Trump, voting by a huge majority to reject his unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.
