TEHRAN – The Iranian Navy has already dispatched 58 fleets to the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. Navy Chief Hossein Khanzadi said on Tuesday that the move was aimed to secure the ships and fight piracy in those waters, ISNA reported. “We’ve had fully independent operations in fighting piracy, thousands of kilometers away from our naval borders to achieve security and freedom of navigation,” the rear admiral said. “We were so successful in this regard that the international community was unable not to give us credit … The International Maritime Organization has issued consecutive acknowledgements to Iranian destroyers,” he added.
