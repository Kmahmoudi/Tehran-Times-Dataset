Prime Minister of Netherlands Mark Rutte said on Wednesday that the U.S. decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 9 was “clumsy”.
 During an EU summit in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, he said the EU leaders agreed that the European Union should play a stronger role on the political world stage, NOS reported. “As Europe, we already have a major leading role in the world. But Europe will have to give more substance to that role with more confidence. You also see that in the area of Iran: we want to try and uphold as many of these agreements as possible,” he said.
