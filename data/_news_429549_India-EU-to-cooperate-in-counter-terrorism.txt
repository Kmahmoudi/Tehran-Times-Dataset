TEHRAN _ India and European Union (EU) have vowed to step up cooperation in effectively dealing with terrorism, extremism and radicalization. The issue figured prominently during India-EU annual counter terrorism and political dialogue in Brussels on Monday. “The discussions focused on the terrorist threats in Europe, South Asia and the Middle East. The EU and India underlined the importance of continuing the progress made in defeating Daesh,” said a statement issued by the EU. The statement said both sides agreed to find ways to enhance cooperation to counter violent extremism and radicalization as well as to deal with chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats. “Exchanges further touched on tackling terrorist use of the Internet and countering terrorism financing,” the statement said. “Finally, the EU and India had a fruitful exchange on multilateralism, underlining their full support for the United Nations, the Global Counter Terrorism Forum and other multilateral fora,” it added. Although global terrorist organizations have failed to gain foothold in India, some homegrown militant organizations have been active in some parts of India, including Kashmir and northeast. There have been reports about the presence of ISIS in some parts of India, but security agencies have dismissed the reports. India has signed agreements with many countries in countering the threat of terrorism and extremism. The cooperation with EU, experts believe, will prove significant in counter terrorism efforts.
