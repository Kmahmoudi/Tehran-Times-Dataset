TEHRAN - In her remarks, the United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, asserted that Trump's border wall campaign has nothing to do with border security. She said it's one of the U.S. President's plans for energizing his conservative base, and in this way, he aims to distract the country from the various scandals dogging his administration. “I don’t even know if the president wants the wall. I think he just wants a debate on the wall. And he’s having some difficulty with it,” Pelosi said during a press briefing at the Capitol. “He keeps increasing the amount of money; increasing the amount of beds; increasing the obstacles to finding a solution — because I don’t think he really wants a solution,” Pelosi said. “I think he loves the distraction that this is from his other problems,” She added. Pelosi, along with Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, noted that they disagree with Trump over building a physical border Wall, which according to them, would be expensive and ineffective. "Democrats and the president both want stronger border security. However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it … Most presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration," said Schumer in answer to Trump's recent remarks. On the other hand, Pelosi is among those who are seriously standing against Trump's impeachment. This dual approach taken by Pelosi towards the White House, and the fact that the House speaker and other Democrat leaders have argued against the serious consideration of Trump's impeachment, may lead to conflicts inside the Democratic Party in the future.  “We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report. We shouldn’t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn’t avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we’ll just have to see how it comes," Said Pelosi. However, Pelosi's remarks were not unprecedented! When Pelosi was the House Minority Leader in years between 2016 and 2018, she opposed the idea of impeaching Trump. Nancy Pelosi has made it clear that she has a conservative approach towards Trump. This is while with a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Democrats can initiate impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. The fact that some Democrat leaders have opposed Nancy Pelosi's Minority leadership in the US House of Representatives is rooted in the same reason. In any case, it seems that Pelosi prefers scenarios such as "making a political deal with Trump" to "Confrontation with the President". Nancy Pelosi argues that Democrats' direct confrontation with Trump, and in particular the impeachment of the President of the United States, will lead to the anger of some American citizens, and the Democrats will be accused of posing a blow to the American political and social equations. However, it seems that some Democrats do not agree with Nancy Pelosi's opinion! Politicians such as Bernie Sanders believe that Trump is not politically negotiable. They believe that any compromise reached between Democrats and Trump will hold a bad result for them in the U.S. 2020 presidential election. At any rate, there’s plenty at stake: Amid this crisis, Trump has come with the idea of declaring a national emergency at the border, a move that could free up wall funding without the Congress approval. “If this doesn't work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely,” said Trump. The U.S. government shutdown, which is resulted from the disagreements over border wall funding, is still ongoing. Trump is demanding $5.7 billion for new wall construction; Pelosi and the Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for border security measures, but have opposed construction of any new physical barriers. In spite of this, Trump has previously claimed that he's ready to hold the shutdown for months and even years! If Pelosi surrender in the face of Trump's demands, she would be regarded as a defeated figure inside the U.S. political circles.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
