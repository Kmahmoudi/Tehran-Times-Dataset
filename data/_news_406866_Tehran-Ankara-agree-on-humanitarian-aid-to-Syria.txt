TEHRAN – Iran and Turkey announced on Wednesday they have agreed on an arrangement to provide humanitarian aid to Syria, after the U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire failed after one week.  The agreement was announced after Iranian Foreign Minister held closed-door talks with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu and other Turkish officials.  Having attended the 71st Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Zarif stopped in Ankara Wednesday morning on his way back to Tehran to hold talks with Turkish officials. 
This is the third round of talks between the Iranian and Turkish foreign ministers over the past two months. AFP quoted an unnamed Turkish diplomatic source as saying that the conflict in Syria was among the topics on the agenda of Zarif-Cavusoglu discussions. Iran and Turkey have differences over the situation in Syria, but have started closer cooperation after the July coup in Turkey. 
Iran was the first country to condemn the coup attempt.  Also, on agenda has been expansion of relations between the two neighboring countries.  AK/PA
