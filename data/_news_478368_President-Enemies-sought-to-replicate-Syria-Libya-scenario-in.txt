TEHRAN — Iran’s President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi said late on Friday that the enemies sought to turn Iran into Syria and Libya, but they failed. In a 4-hour meeting with the students participating in the first course of the "Paths of Progress Camps", Raisi stated, “Riots and attempts to disrupt the country are different from protests, and riots and those who create insecurity must be confronted.” Stating that Iran and its various cities are safe today, the president said, “Americans and our enemies sought to make the country insecure by implementing their patterns in Libya and Syria, but they failed.” Elsewhere in his remarks, the president noted that the Islamic Republic has had many advances that the people and even many elites don’t know about them in details. He then expressed hope that the holding of the camps of the Paths of Progress, like the camps of the Paths of Light, will bring many blessings to the country. The president considered students' familiarity with the country's progress and achievements as a factor to strengthen their motivation and determination, noting, “Students will see the progress made and will know that wherever we had more restrictions and sanctions, we made more progress with the will and determination of researchers, and this progress has made the enemy scrambling to devise new conspiracies.” Raisi considered the students and especially the members of the Olympiad teams to be the symbol and manifestation of the country's progress and stressed on identifying these talents and providing the necessary conditions for their continued growth and excellence. “The talented should know the system of the country's issues and use their abilities in the path of fixing these issues,” he underlined.
