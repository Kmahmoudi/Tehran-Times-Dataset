ISFAHAN, Iran - The Swiss foreign minister says his country is determined to expand relations with Iran in areas of tourism and science after the end of the Coronavirus pandemic. Â In a meeting with the governor of IsfahanÂ on Saturday, Ignazio Cassis said,Â "Tomorrow in Tehran, in an official meeting, we will commemorate the 100 years of joint diplomatic activity between Iran and Switzerland." He noted,Â "Relations between Iran and Switzerland dates back to 100 years since the late 19th century with the signing of peace and trade agreement." The foreign minister added,Â "Peace and trade are two important factors in the development of countries and we are here today to say that Switzerland has always sought peace and tranquility."
