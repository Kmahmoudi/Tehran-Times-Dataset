TEHRAN – The Kremlin has announced it welcomes the participation of Washington in the Astana talks on the Syrian crisis, but Iran’s stance is complicating the issues. “We will welcome that [the participation of the U.S. in the talks]. The situation is very complicated. You know that there is also Iran like a very important player in the Syrian issue. Iranians are not welcoming this,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told BBC in an interview. “So it is a very complicated issue for a very careful play.”  This is the first time since the December trilateral talks in Moscow that the Kremlin is openly referring to disagreements with Tehran over the U.S. presence in the Astana peace talks, due Jan. 23.  Peskov also referred to the issue as one possible “cause of disagreement between Moscow and Tehran...” emphasizing that it won’t be possible to bring the Syrian crisis to a halt “without the United States.”  Prior to Moscow’s formal stance, senior Iranian officials had rejected the participation of Washington in the Astana talks.  “We are against the presence of the U.S. in the Astana talks and have not invited the Americans,” said Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.  In the same vein, Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani had ruled out any role for the White House in the talks due to Iran’s disagreement.  “Because of Iran’s disagreement, no joint invitation by three countries of Russia, Turkey and Iran who took the initiative has been extended to the American side,” Shamkhani, who coordinates  political, military, and security affairs between Iran, Russia, and Turkey on the Syrian crisis, was quoted as saying.  All through the path to the Astana talks, Russia has been unpredictable, and at time impulsive.  Following a tripartite meeting between foreign ministers of Iran, Russia, and Turkey, a ceasefire was declared only by Russia and Turkey. Embracing the U.S. contribution to the crisis can be linked to the new Trump administration, what Moscow has been showing to favor for closer ties with the country.  However, it seems to be remain to be seen what Russia has in mind.  Historical clues would say the Russians are not wedded to any partner, and Tehran knows this more than anybody else.   AK/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
