TEHRAN - Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps second-in-command, has warned that the Zionists in the occupied territories will make themselves close to death if they start a new war.
 “If the Zionists make a mistake and do something that wage a new war, they should be sure that this war will end in their elimination,” he said in a televised interview aired late Saturday. He noted that the Zionists should not think that the United States can save them if they take adventurous moves.  “The Zionists should not rely on the U.S., because they will be annihilated before the U.S. arrives and should search for cemeteries outside the occupied Palestine,” he said. Elsewhere, he pointed to Iran’s missile power and said that the country’s missile program is “deterrent” and non-negotiable. The IRGC official also noted that Iran has no technical limitation to increase range of its missiles or their precision. Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said on Tuesday that “Iran has no scientific limitation to extend the range of its military missiles” however, Iran has “no will not the will to extend the range of missiles based on its defense doctrine”. Iran is working to increase the “precision” of its missiles, remarked Shamkhani, who served as defense minister during the Khatami administration.  NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
