TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a top advisor to the Supreme Leader, said on Monday the supervisory board of BARJAM (the Persian acronym for the nuclear deal) will hold a session on U.S. government’s non-compliance with the deal after President Rouhani returns home from New York. Velayati said Iran will make an appropriate response to any measure that Washington takes against the nuclear accord. He also rejected the possibility of any bilateral meeting between Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his American counterpart Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of the annual UN summit in New York.
