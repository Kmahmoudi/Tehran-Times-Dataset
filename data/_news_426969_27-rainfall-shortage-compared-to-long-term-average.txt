Referring to the provinces with the highest and lowest rainfall during the last eleven months, he noted that provinces of West Azarbaijan and East Azarbaijan have received the highest precipitation rates by 25 and 21 percent increase in rainfall compared to the long-term mean.  “At the same time, Kordestan, Kermanshah, Ardebil, Hamedan, Zanjan, Qazvin, Semnan and Ilam provinces met normal average,” Ziaeian stated. He regretted that Sistan-Baluchestan province has been suffering serious rainfall shortages with 74 percent drop, adding, provinces of Hormozgan and Kerman both experiencing 66 percent of below-average rainfall, and Fars province lacking precipitation by 56 percent, have been listed among the cities having the lowest precipitation rates.  “Over the same period, Tehran averaging just 205 millimeters of precipitation, faced 53 millimeters drop compared to its long-term average of 258 millimeters,” he noted.
