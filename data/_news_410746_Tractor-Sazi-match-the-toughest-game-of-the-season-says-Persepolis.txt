Persepolis football team head coach Branko Ivankovic believes that the match against Tractor Sazi on Sunday is the most difficult test of the season for his men. Iran Professional League (IPL) pacesetter Persepolis will host second-place Tractor Sazi in Tehran’s Azadi Stadium on Sunday. “The top two teams of the league will meet together and I believe this is the most difficult test for us. Fortunately, we play at home and the fans will play a big role in our success. We play for our fans and I promise we will make every effort to make them happy,” Branko said in the pre-match press conference. “I am sad after hearing that FIFA imposed transfer ban on Tractor Sazi. I can understand their situation, but it’s not Amir Ghalenoei’s fault and it has nothing to do with him,” Branko added. “With respect to all of the league teams, we play every match to get the three points no matter who we are playing,” the Croatian coach added. Last week in an interview with a Croatian website Branko revealed that he has rejected the offer to sign former Arsenal and Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor. “Yes I rejected Adebayor. The problem with these kind of players is that they had been great players but now they are at the end of their careers and do not have enthusiasm. I don’t want players without passion and motivation,” Branko said. Persepolis are currently at the top of IPL table with 44 points from 19 games, followed by Tractor Sazi.
