TEHRAN - The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) issued a statement on Wednesday threatening to give the U.S. an unforgettable lesson after Washington named it a terrorist organization.

 U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Monday that Washington is designating the IRGC a foreign “terrorist organization”, marking the first time the U.S. has formally labelled another country’s military a terrorist group. The IRGC adopts the policy of retaliation in the face of the enemies, the IRGC said in the statement, adding that the adversaries “will be given an unforgettable and exemplary lesson that would make them regret, if necessary.” It described the U.S. decision to label it a “terrorist group” as yet another episode in a series of U.S. defeats. The statement stressed that Washington’s move has strengthened the IRGC’s resolve to further boost its defense and offensive systems and capabilities, as well as its rising regional might. It also lauded the support that the Iranian officials and people expressed for the IRGC in recent days, stressing that such widespread backing for the IRGC signifies the invalidity of the adventurist U.S. government’s move. Responding to the move, Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) immediately declared the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism and U.S. forces terrorist. The SNSC said it has put CENTCOM on its terror list as a “reciprocal measure” against the U.S. “illegal and unwise” move.
