TEHRAN – Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi highlighted the historical roots of Islam in Russia compared to other non-Muslim countries, saying that Islam constitutes more fields of cooperation with Russia. President Raisi sent a message to the Summit of the Muslims of Russia on the occasion of commemorating the 1,100th year of the presence of Islam in Russia. The message was read out by Haj Abolghasem Doulabi, Raisi’s representative to the summit, according to the official website of the Iranian presidency.  In the message, Ayatollah Raisi called Russia one of the first foci of the presence of Islam in distant lands and stated, "We Muslim Iranians are proud of ourselves that the historical city of Derbent, which is the center of fusion and intersection of Russian, Iranian and Islamic culture, is the first passage and the focal point of the presence of Muslims in this vast land". The text of President Raisi's message is as follows: The religion of Islam appeared at a time in the history of this world when the blackness and darkness of ignorance, corruption and crookedness in the field of life had narrowed the human race and the Prophet of Islam (PBUH) made this distortion of spirituality and morality, the deposit of peace and security in the sphere of justice for humanity. In the meantime, the unique capacity of Islam and religions in this civilized country promises fields of more cooperation and synergy in a bright and sublime future. We Muslim Iranians are proud of ourselves that the historical city of Derbent, which is the center of fusion and intersection of Russian, Iranian and Islamic culture, is the first passage and the focal point of the presence of Muslims in this vast land. The Islamic Republic, according to the guidelines of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution as in the past and within the framework of the three principles of honor, wisdom and expediency, has always demanded to pay attention to the capacities of the Islamic religion in the vast country of Russia with the aim of developing bilateral interactions, and in it will not spare any assistance and cooperation in this way.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
