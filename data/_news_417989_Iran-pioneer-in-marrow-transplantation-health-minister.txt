TEHRAN – Iran’s medical sector has extensive experiences in the field of marrow transplantation and is considered as a pioneer in the region, Health Minister Hassan Qazizadeh-Hashemi announced. He made the remarks at the 22nd Annual Congress of Asia-Pacific Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group (APBMT), which is currently underway at the Espinas Palace Hotel, Tehran. Over 100 participants from other countries are taking part in the two-day event, many of them from Asian countries, he said, IRNA reported. He pointed to marrow transplantation operations done in Iran over the past 25 years, saying that Iran has always been one of the main participants in international events related to this issue. APBMT is an international organization which is involved in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, information sharing as well as basic and clinical research in Asia-Pacific countries.  APBMT 2017 provides an outstanding opportunity for all scholars from the Asia-Pacific region to communicate and exchange ideas in order to improve the outcome of Hematopioetic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT).  Over the past two decades, the Iranian Society of Medical Oncology and Hematology (ISMOH) and the Iranian Society of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation have had the opportunity to be actively involved in planning and arranging important conferences on hematology-oncology and stem cell transplantation at the national and international levels (APBMT 2004 and APCC 2007).   SB/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
