TEHRAN – ‘Iran-Germany Science Day’ began in Tehran’s University of Science and Technology on Tuesday. The two-day event is being held with 60 faculty members from Germany and 150 Iranian scientists in attendance, ISNA reported. A set of scientific projects have been defined which will be discussed in the event to further facilitate the scientific cooperation of the two country. The scientific and educational ties between Iran and Germany have a long 100-year history, said German Ambassador to Iran Michael Klor-Berchtold who took part in the inauguration ceremony of the event. From 2015 (after signing the JCPOA also known as the nuclear deal), the two nations have tried hard to revive their relations, said Klor-Berchtold, adding that it’s time to enter a new phase of cooperation especially in science and research areas.
