TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency must be purely “impartial” and “technical”.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran has always sought to have positive and technical relations with the International Atomic Energy Agency and will continue cooperating with this international body within the framework of the regulations in future,” Rouhani said during a meeting with IAEA Yukiya Amano Director General in Tehran. Rouhani also called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the official name for the nuclear deal between Iran and great powers, as a “great agreement” and a “positive experience”. He said that Iran will be committed to its obligations in the JCPOA and will not initiate violating the deal. “The Islamic Republic of Iran will be committed to its obligations as long as the other side abides by its commitments. The recent actions of the U.S., especially the extension of ISA, run contrary to the JCPOA,” he said. He added, “The path being taken by the U.S. towards Iran will reduce the international trust on the U.S.” The Iran Sanctions Act was passed by the U.S. Congress became a law with President Obama’s signature. Amano said Iran has implemented its obligations in the nuclear agreement and described the JCPOA as a “great achievement” that the IAEA will support. He attached great importance to expansion of Iran-IAEA cooperation. He assured Rouhani of the fact that the IAEA will fulfill its duties as an “impartial” and “technical” organization. Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany - finalized the text of the JCPOA in July 2015 that took effect in January. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif held a separate meeting with Amano and discussed implementation of the JCPOA. NA/PA
