TEHRAN – On Saturday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani congratulated Hezbollah on the 10th anniversary of the Lebanese resistance movement’s victory against the Zionist regime in the 33-day war.  “The 33-day war gave an unforgettable lesson to the Zionist regime and its international supporters,” Larijani said in a message to Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah secretary general.
 
“The historic victory gained under Allah’s will, your wise leadership and bravery of the warriors of Islamic resistance movement in Lebanon, will be remembered as an honorable achievement in Islamic Ummah’s history,” Larijani remarked.  Israeli generals were dumbfounded by the military power of Hezbollah in the 33 day war that the Tel Aviv regime launched against Hezbollah in the summer of the 2006. The Hezbollah chief had previously described the 33-day war as a “divine and strategic victory”.  “The victory was one of God’s blessings to the Lebanese people,” Nasrallah said last year as Hezbollah marked the war. Nasrallah said the war changed the equation of power in the region. He also reaffirmed Lebanon’s strong resolution to counter the Israeli acts of aggression through resistance. MH/PA
