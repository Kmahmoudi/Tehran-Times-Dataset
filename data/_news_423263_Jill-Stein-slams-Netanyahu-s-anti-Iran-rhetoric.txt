TEHRAN – Former U.S. presidential candidate Jill Stein has slammed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s anti-Iran remarks, saying it is Israel which does not comply with nuclear treaties and inspections. “Let's get this straight: Israel accused Iran of having a secret nuclear weapons program. Israel has a secret nuclear weapons program,” Stein said in a tweet on Thursday. “Iran complies with all treaties and inspections. Israel complies with none. Who’s the nuclear outlaw here?” she added. Her remarks came after Netanyahu claimed that Israel had obtained tens of thousands of pages of what he called Iran’s “secret atomic archives”.
