TEHRAN – Several publications were honored at the 17th edition of Iran’s annual Sacred Defense Book of the Year awards on Tuesday.
 Winners received their awards during a ceremony at the Sacred Defense Garden Museum in Tehran.  “Research Journal for the Islamic Revolution and Sacred Defense” by Golamreza Kafi received the award in the Literary Research Section.  In the Domestic Plots Section, “Farangis” won the award. The book written by Mahnaz Fattahi is the memoirs of Farangis Heidarpur, an Iranian woman who defended herself against the Iraqi soldiers after their village Evazin near the border between Iran and Iraq was invaded during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.  “A Pen in Color Earth”, which is a biography of Martyr Habib Ghanipur by Golali Babai, was picked in the Documentary Section.  No works in any of the other 13 categories were found to merit a prize. The jury only praised publications in those categories with honorable mentions.  The award was established to honor books on the Iran-Iraq war, which is called in Iran “Sacred Defense”.
