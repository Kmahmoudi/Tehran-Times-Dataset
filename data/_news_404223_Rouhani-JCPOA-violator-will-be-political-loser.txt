TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said on Wednesday that any country that violates the nuclear deal - officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - will be a “political loser” in the world.

 “The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is beneficial to all countries and international peace, security, stability and development but a violation of it will be detrimental to all. And anyone who starts it will be the political loser at the international arena,” he said during a meeting with the cabinet members. The president reiterated that Iran abides by its obligation under the JCPOA. It is essential for all sides to implement the JCPOA and be committed to it based on “national interests” and “wisdom”, he noted. Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany - finalized the text of the JCPOA in Vienna on July 14 2015. The deal took effect on January 16, 2016. “The Islamic Republic of Iran proved on this day [July 14, 2015] that it has the political capability to negotiate with the world powers to solve a complicated international issue and defend the Iranian nation’s rights,” he explained. He said that the nuclear negotiations revealed Iran’s “political, legal and technical capabilities” and led to the recognition of the country’s nuclear rights. He also said that the nuclear deal proved to the world this fact that Iran had never been seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Rouhani also said that there is no doubt about the fact that the post-JCPOA atmosphere makes it possible to expand economic activities. He called for using new opportunities created after the implementation of the nuclear deal instead of focusing on “marginal” issues. It is possible to enjoy the post-JCPOA atmosphere through “unity” and “integrity”, the president pointed out.
