TEHRAN – Top Iranian diplomat Majid Takht-Ravanchi has said that “Dialogue Announcement”, a poster exhibition displaying works by Iranian graphic designers at Tehran’s Niavaran Cultural Center, conveys the Iranian people’s message of peace to the world.

 Speaking at an opening ceremony of the six-day exhibit on Friday, he added, “The posters in this collection confirm once again that the Iranian people have always been seeking peace and dialogue.” “These artworks can represent the art-loving and pacifist nature of the Iranian people as certain people are waging wars in the world.” He praised the active participation of female Iranian artists in the exhibition and said that the exhibition can give the correct positive image of Iran to the world. He expressed his hope that Iran could organize the exhibition at UN headquarters in the future. “Dialogue and Positive Interaction with the Globe” is the theme of the exhibition, which is showcasing works by 29 promising young artists, including Zahra Saleminejad, Masumeh Najafi, Elham Zakizadeh, Vahid Nazari and Zohreh Shirvani.    Ashkan Qazanchi is the curator of the exhibition.
