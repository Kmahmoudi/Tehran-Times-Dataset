Iran's Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi announced on Wednesday that a “Takfiri” terrorist plot involving foreign nationals has been defused in the southern province of Fars, Press TV reported.
 Alavi said during the operations, several foreign nationals were detained and around 100 kilograms of explosives were discovered. He also said that the Takfiris had planned to carry out their plot during the mourning ceremonies commemorating the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hussein (AS), the third Shia imam. “Evidence shows that Iran’s enemies guided the terrorists from overseas to create sectarian strife inside the country,” he said. The minister added, "Intelligence Ministry agents, with the cooperation of other security forces…, succeeded to defuse one of the anti-security plots of the Takfiri terrorist groups and prevent an inhuman crime in the ceremonies."
