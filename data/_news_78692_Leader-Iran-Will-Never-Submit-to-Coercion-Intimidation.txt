Ayatollah Khamenei, referring to recent events in Palestine, lambasted Washington's indifference to the fact that the sentiments of world peoples have been hurt by the crimes being committed by the Zionist regime in occupied Palestine. "The stances of the Islamic Republic towards America's logic of force and hegemony is quite clear. A nation and a government that have led a revolution in the name of Islam and national identity and independence, will never submit to U.S. bullying policies," the leader said. The leader was speaking to large groups of teachers and workers from throughout the country on the occasion of Labor and Teachers' Day. Ayatollah Khamenei deplored recent events in Palestine, massacre of innocent people, destruction of houses and arrest of the youth, calling the acts as "the most heinous crimes ever committed. The goal of the U.S. in supporting the Zionist regime and ignoring its crimes and brutality is to declare its policy of intimidation and international dictatorship to the world and to stress the need to keep alive the cancerous tumor of the Zionist regime at any cost, said the Leader. The polices of the U.S. and Zionist regime have failed despite their claims to the contrary because the Palestinian nation has not surrendered themselves to their wishes and injustices and would neither do so in the future, said the Leader. He added that the Palestinian nation has so far tolerated all the pressures. The climax of the Palestinians' resistance is manifested in the martyrdom-seeking operations, carried out by the Palestinian youth, said the Leader, adding that the operations have terrified the enemy. Ayatollah Khamenei warned that American statesmen and their lies try to play down the Palestinians' martyrdom- seeking operations. He said such self-sacrificing acts and devotion for the sake of national and religious interests reflect the climax of a nation's honor, courage and dignity. The Palestinian nation is 'alive and vigilant' and will continue its way, the Leader added. Practical support for the Palestinian nation is another form of the struggle against the Zionist regime's crimes, said the Leader, urging the world nations and Muslim states, especially the Arab ones, to support Palestinians in practice. The Leader said the proposal on a month-long oil embargo against the countries supporting the Zionist regime is serious and the Arab and Muslim oil exporting states are required to make serious decisions in this respect instead of paying lip services. Ayatollah Khamenei said that the proposed month-long oil embargo would show that Muslim and Arab nations and governments are able to stand up and take action against international dictatorship. Hailing the brave stances taken by certain Arab states, such as Syria and Lebanon, the Leader called support for the oppressed Palestinian nation as a "historical duty." The Leader said future generations would judge about the measures adopted by the Arab and Muslim states today and about the extent of their sincerity, IRNA reported. Referring to the claims raised by American officials and propaganda campaigns launched by the U.S. media about world leadership, human rights, fair war and campaign against terrorism, the Leader said that such claims by the U.S. government and its support for the Zionist regime as the most criminal and terrorist regime, make everyone surprised with the impudence of these statesmen. So, he said, the U.S. Administration is today hated by world nations more than ever before. He said the White House is hostile towards Iran for its justice seeking and independent stances and because the Islamic establishment does not fear the U.S. threats. "The Islamic Republic of Iran would never succumb to the U.S. logic of force and hegemony," Ayatollah Khamenei made it clear. The Leader said negotiations and relations with the U.S. would not ease pressures because there are now countries threatened by the U.S. which have relations with that country and negotiate with it. The Islamic establishment and its Islamic identity that have put an end to the U.S. domination over Iran, are the main problems the U.S. has with Iran, said Ayatollah Khamenei, adding that the U.S. will never be ready to officially recognize Iran's Islamic identity and its faithful nation at the negotiating table. "Any talks would be in favor of the U.S. because at the negotiating table, Washington will only set forth a large number of its unjustifiable demands," said Ayatollah Khamenei. The Iranian nation will not allow any official - either the Leader or others - to compromise Islamic stances and the country's fundamental and vital interests, warned Ayatollah Khamenei. Resistance of the Iranian nation and government is the only form of the struggle against the U.S. greedy desires and ambitions, said Ayatollah Khamenei, stressing that the Islamic establishment that relies on public votes, emotions, will and faith do not fear any threat posed by big powers. Ayatollah Khamenei brushed aside the claims that there is no freedom in Iran and said there are certain segments of press that exploit the free atmosphere of the country and write articles that run counter to the public faith, beliefs and interests. "To attain its lofty goals, Iran is today more than ever in need of ceaseless efforts by government officials, parliamentarians and other influential bodies," said the Leader. The Leader lauded the efforts being made by teachers and workers in Iran.

The Leader said negotiations and relations with the U.S. would not ease pressures because there are now countries threatened by the U.S. which have relations with that country and negotiate with it. The Islamic establishment and its Islamic identity that have put an end to the U.S. domination over Iran, are the main problems the U.S. has with Iran, said Ayatollah Khamenei, adding that the U.S. will never be ready to officially recognize Iran's Islamic identity and its faithful nation at the negotiating table. "Any talks would be in favor of the U.S. because at the negotiating table, Washington will only set forth a large number of its unjustifiable demands," said Ayatollah Khamenei. The Iranian nation will not allow any official - either the Leader or others - to compromise Islamic stances and the country's fundamental and vital interests, warned Ayatollah Khamenei. Resistance of the Iranian nation and government is the only form of the struggle against the U.S. greedy desires and ambitions, said Ayatollah Khamenei, stressing that the Islamic establishment that relies on public votes, emotions, will and faith do not fear any threat posed by big powers. Ayatollah Khamenei brushed aside the claims that there is no freedom in Iran and said there are certain segments of press that exploit the free atmosphere of the country and write articles that run counter to the public faith, beliefs and interests. "To attain its lofty goals, Iran is today more than ever in need of ceaseless efforts by government officials, parliamentarians and other influential bodies," said the Leader. The Leader lauded the efforts being made by teachers and workers in Iran.
  The Palestinian nation is 'alive and vigilant' and will continue its way, the Leader added. Practical support for the Palestinian nation is another form of the struggle against the Zionist regime's crimes, said the Leader, urging the world nations and Muslim states, especially the Arab ones, to support Palestinians in practice. The Leader said the proposal on a month-long oil embargo against the countries supporting the Zionist regime is serious and the Arab and Muslim oil exporting states are required to make serious decisions in this respect instead of paying lip services. Ayatollah Khamenei said that the proposed month-long oil embargo would show that Muslim and Arab nations and governments are able to stand up and take action against international dictatorship. Hailing the brave stances taken by certain Arab states, such as Syria and Lebanon, the Leader called support for the oppressed Palestinian nation as a "historical duty." The Leader said future generations would judge about the measures adopted by the Arab and Muslim states today and about the extent of their sincerity, IRNA reported. Referring to the claims raised by American officials and propaganda campaigns launched by the U.S. media about world leadership, human rights, fair war and campaign against terrorism, the Leader said that such claims by the U.S. government and its support for the Zionist regime as the most criminal and terrorist regime, make everyone surprised with the impudence of these statesmen. So, he said, the U.S. Administration is today hated by world nations more than ever before. He said the White House is hostile towards Iran for its justice seeking and independent stances and because the Islamic establishment does not fear the U.S. threats.
