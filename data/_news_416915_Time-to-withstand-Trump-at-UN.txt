World leaders are gathering at the United Nations headquarters in New York to give speeches about priorities, threats to global security, the scourge of terrorism, poverty, and generally the pressing needs of today’s world.
 Now it is an opportune time that world leaders warn about Donald Trump’s unilateral approaches such as his order to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The United States is the main culprit to the global warming. It is enough to know that for several decades or maybe even for more than a century the U.S. has been the biggest emitter to the world, lonely accounting for more than 30 of emissions to the atmosphere. This sense of irresponsibility shows Trump’s selfishness and his disdain for people of other countries who have been affected by the global warming and the ensuing consequences such as droughts, poverty, dislocations, etc. Missteps by Trump who is the wrong side of history is not just limited to the climate agreement. In recent days he has also been leveling the harshest remarks against the nuclear pact clinched between Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany, and the European Union. Now that he is making preparations to tear up the UN-endorsed nuclear deal which is also backed by the entire world, how can countries expect other international treaties to survive? In addition, his incendiary remarks may push the Korean Peninsula toward a nuclear holocaust.   Through such actions the U.S. president and his loyalists are gradually pushing the international order to the verge of collapse. People’s memory is still fresh with inconsiderate actions by certain extremist statesmen who pushed the world toward disasters. World War I and World War II are just reminders. Before it is too late world leaders must warn Trump about his inconsiderate and risky games. Failure to do may prove extremely costly for the world.
