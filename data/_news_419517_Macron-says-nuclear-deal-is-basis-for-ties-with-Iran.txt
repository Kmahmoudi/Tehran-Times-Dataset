French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that the 2015 nuclear deal is the “basis of Paris-Tehran cooperation” and “unchangeable”.
 In a meeting during which he received credentials of Iran’s new ambassador to France Abolghassem Delfi, Macron expressed satisfaction over cordial relations between France and Iran and voiced France's willingness to negotiate with Iran on regional developments. Delfi, for his part, said Iran has always emphasized the need for settlement of regional issues through dialogue and is against any foreign intervention. Referring to history of long relationship between Iran and France, the ambassador said the two countries' consultations can help foster regional stability and security. However, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in Washington that France and the United States are determined to “vigorously” raise pressure on Iran over its ballistic missile program, including possibly through sanctions, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Le Drian was in the American capital on Monday to meet U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster and U.S. President Donald Trump’s special adviser Jared Kushner. Le Drian is due in Iran at the beginning of January.
