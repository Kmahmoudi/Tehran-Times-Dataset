TEHRAN – Hamas representative in Tehran Khaled al-Qaddumi on Sunday censured U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize al-Quds as the capital of Israel, saying the move has emboldened the Zionist regime to commit more crimes. Al-Qaddumi said Trump has an aggressive personality and his policies have created feelings of hatred towards him in the Muslim world. He also said the Arab allies of the United States should realize that having close ties with Washington will not benefit them as the White House considers the Zionist regime above all.
