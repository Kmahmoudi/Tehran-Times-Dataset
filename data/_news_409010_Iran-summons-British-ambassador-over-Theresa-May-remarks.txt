TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it had summoned England’s ambassador to protest over anti-Iran remarks by the country’s Prime Minister Theresa May. Addressing a [Persian] Gulf Cooperation Council’s annual summit in the Bahraini capital Manama on Wednesday, May said she was “clear-eyed” about what she called “the threat” Iran poses to the region”. May had also stressed England would help the council “push back” against what she branded Iran’s “aggressive regional actions.” “Following meddling remarks by England’s Prime Minister Theresa May at the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council, Nicholas Hopton was summoned to the Foreign Ministry,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Saturday.  Iran’s strong objection to the remarks was conveyed to the ambassador, he added. “Irresponsible, provoking, and decisive remarks of Theresa May at the summit are unacceptable and rejected,” Iranian officials had told the British ambassador, Bahrami added. Earlier, Chairman of the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Alaeddin Boroujerdi had warned England of re-downgrading relations over the “divisive” remarks. “The remarks by England’s prime minister have nothing to do with the realities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and testify to England’s divisive policy,” said Boroujerdi in a televised program.  Also, Hamid Baeedinejad, Iran’s ambassador to London, on Friday condemned the remarks.
