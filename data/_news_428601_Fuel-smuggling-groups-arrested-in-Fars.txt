TEHRAN – Forces from the Intelligence Ministry have managed to disband several groups involved in smuggling various kinds of fuels, the ministry announced on Monday. In a statement, the Ministry stated its forces in the southern province of Fars have identified several fuel-smuggling groups and arrested six members of them, Tasnim reported. The smugglers usually hid fuels through increasing the capacity of fuel tanks of buses and sold the fuels in the main routes between Shiraz, Zahedan, Iranshahr, and Chabahar, the statement said. Ever since Iran’s national currency has dropped rapidly in value, the smuggling of fuel out of Iran has soared.
