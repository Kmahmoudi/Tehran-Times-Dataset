TEHRAN – The Spanish ambassador to Tehran has called Iran the main player in the West Asia region and said the nuclear deal is key to the success of the Iranian foreign diplomacy. 

 Speaking to IRNA, Eduardo López Busquets said that commitment of all sides to the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is the basis for expansion of ties. “Once the JCPOA was reached, the main obstacle for the deepening of relations between Iran and the EU and its member states was eliminated,” the minister said, according to a translation of his remarks.
