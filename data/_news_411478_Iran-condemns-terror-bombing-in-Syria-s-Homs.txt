TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry has strongly condemned a Sunday bombing series in Homs, Syria, calling it an act to derail current political talks over Syria.

 The incident makes it necessary that all Syrian sides be vigilant under such circumstances, spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, ISNA reported. General Hassan Daabul, head of military intelligence for Homs, was among at least 32 people killed in a series of suicide attacks on military installations in the government-held western city of Homs.
