TEHRAN - Heavy dust storms hit the western and southwestern provinces of Iran, namely Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Ilam, Lorestan, Khuzestan, and Bushehr on Saturday.   Dust storms will also continue in Ilam, Lorestan, Khuzestan and Bushehr provinces on Sunday, Tasnim news agency quoted a report by the meteorological organization as saying. Sand and dust storms mostly originated from hotspots in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Central Asia are adversely affecting Iranian cities in western areas and causing great discomfort for the poor dwellers. Many ponds which were once located in the arid and desert regions stretching from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea to Iran have gone dry over the years. This ongoing desertification process has greatly increased the number of dust storms in the region and every year heavy dust storms envelope more than half of the country.
