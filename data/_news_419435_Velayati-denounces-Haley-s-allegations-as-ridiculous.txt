TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior foreign policy adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, on Sunday railed against Washington after its Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley accused Iran of sending missiles to the Houthis in Yemen. Velayati rejected the allegations, saying Haley’s remarks were ridiculous and made without a shred of evidence to back them up, IRIB news reported. Haley is not “polite” and she acts like her president whose words are baseless and cause laughter, remarked Velayati, a veteran politician who was Iran’s foreign minister from 1981 to 1997. On Thursday, Haley claimed that Iran has violated the UN Security Council resolutions by providing Yemen’s Houthis with missiles to target Saudi Arabia.
