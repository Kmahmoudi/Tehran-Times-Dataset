TEHRAN – Iran’s Supreme National Security Council secretary said on Friday that Takfiri terrorists in Iraq and Syria are on the “slope of defeat” even though their supporters are seeking to procrastinate the process of their defeat.
 The remarks by Ali Shamkhani come as the Iraqi army and its allied Kurdish forces launched a massive assault against Daesh on Monday. Shamkhani also said supporters of the terrorists have failed to undermine the capabilities of the resistance front. He said that it is essential for the regional countries to raise public awareness about the “new strategies” being drawn up by certain countries to hamper the fight against terrorists. Shamkhani also said there are divisions inside Daesh and also between Daesh and other Takfiri groups. Elsewhere, the top security official said Iran will definitely continue supporting the “oppressed regional people and has no fear of publicizing any direct support for the oppressed governments and people.” Shamkhani also said that Iran will continue empowering Palestinians in their struggle against the Zionist regime of Israel.
