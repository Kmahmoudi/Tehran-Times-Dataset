TEHRAN-- A vulture has returned to a protected area in western Iran after 2 decades following recent downpours that have revived over 40 wetlands in the country.
 “Recent rainfalls has resulted in considerable water inflow in the protected region of Lashkardar,” chief of Malayer Department of Environment Majid Shabanlou told IRNA news agency on Sunday. After 20 years, vulture, that is a scavenging bird of prey, has returned to the region, he added. Lashkardar region is situated in the east and southeast of the city of Malayer in the western Hamedan Province. It was declared as a no-hunt zone back in 1984 and declared a protected area three years later. It is home to more than 200 plant species, as well as 75 bird and 18 mammal species. Vultures left the area due to drought and low inflow of the springs in Lashkardar region, the official highlighted. 15 springs in the protected region have all been recharged after the recent rainfalls, Shabanlou said.
