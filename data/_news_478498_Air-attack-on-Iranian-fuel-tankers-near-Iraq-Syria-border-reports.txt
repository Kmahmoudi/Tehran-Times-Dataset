TEHRAN - An air strike late on Tuesday hit two fuel tankers in the Syrian territory shortly after they entered from Iraq, the Iranian TV reported. The strike hit two of the tankers that entered from Al Qaim border crossing in western Iraq to Albu Kamal in Syria, a senior Iraqi official told The National. The vehicles were part of a 22-tanker convoy transporting fuel oil from Iran to Lebanon, he said. The convoy entered Iraq and then Syria legally in coordination between the governments. It is not clear whether the attack was carried out by a drone or fighter jet. The Iranian TV reporter from Iraq said nobody has been hurt in the attack. Iraqi sources said at least four explosions rocked the al-Qaim border crossing early on Wednesday.  Iraq and Iran have been supplying Lebanon with fuel oil to alleviate pressure on the country's struggling electricity grid.
