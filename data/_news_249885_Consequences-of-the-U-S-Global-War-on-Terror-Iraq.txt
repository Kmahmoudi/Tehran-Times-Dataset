One of the fundamental consequences of the Global War on Terror (GWOT) was the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its coalition forces. The United States of America falsely used weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as an initial excuse for invading Iraq and removing Saddam Hussein from power. Additionally, the Bush administration attempted to justify the war through false intelligence, which claimed a link between al-Qaedaâ€™s Osama bin Laden and the Iraqi regime. Although the defeat of the Iraqi military was swift, the consequences of the invasion and occupation of Iraq produced horrific results that continue to negatively impact Iraq and the region to this day.
