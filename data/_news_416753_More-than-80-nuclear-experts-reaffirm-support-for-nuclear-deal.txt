More than 80 of the world's leading nuclear nonproliferation specialists issued a joint statement on Wednesday reaffirming support for the Iran nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 According to  Arms Control Association, the statement is endorsed by former U.S. nuclear negotiators, former senior U.S. nonproliferation and intelligence officials, a former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a former member of the UN Panel of Experts on Iran, and leading nuclear specialists from the United States and around the globe. “We firmly support vigorous efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with the JCPOA,” the experts say, “ but we are concerned by statements from the Trump administration that it may be seeking to create a false pretext for accusing Iran of noncooperation or noncompliance with the agreement in order to trigger the reimposition of nuclear-related sanctions against Iran.” PA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
