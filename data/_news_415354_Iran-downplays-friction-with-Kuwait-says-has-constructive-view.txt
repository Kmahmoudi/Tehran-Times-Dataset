TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday downplayed the recent diplomatic row with Kuwait, saying the two countries have always enjoyed “good ties” and that Tehran has a “constructive views” toward neighbors.
 The comments followed a few days after Kuwait told Iran to close down its cultural and military missions and to reduce its embassy staff over Tehran's alleged links to a "spy and terror" cell. Yet the ministry did not hide Tehran’s dismay over the decision by Kuwait. “The recent action by Kuwait was not good and is condemnable,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said in a news briefing.  “Despite this we still can have our dialogues and contacts,” Qassemi added. The spokesman also dismissed rumors that Kuwait has ordered the top Iranian diplomat to leave the country, saying Iran’s ambassador will remain in his post in Kuwait. "The ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to be present in Kuwait and the embassy will be active at the ambassadorial level, and there is no problem in this regard," he stated. “Kuwait has not expelled the Iranian diplomats and did not call them persona non grata. Kuwait has just announced that Iran should reduce number of diplomats in its embassy,” he added.  The Foreign Ministry official went on to say that Tehran “reserves the right to take retaliatory action”. Following the decision by Kuwait, the Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned Kuwait’s charge d’affaires on Thursday.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran has no implications in case and the Kuwaiti authorities had been notified of this from the outset,” the ministry said.   “Iran has always acted responsibly toward regional countries, including Kuwait in trying times,” it added.
