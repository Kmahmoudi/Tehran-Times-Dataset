TEHRAN – Iran’s cultural heritage body has launched a demarcation project to define boundaries of Tal-e Sefidak, a Sassanid-era site which is situated amidst pieces of farmland in Hajiabad, Fars province. The project aims to prevent possible encroachments on Tal-e Sefidak, which embraces a valuable collection of Sassanid architecture and arts, CHTN reported on Saturday. Experts Samira Jafari and Mohammad-Hassan Paknejad are co-directing the scheme under the auspices of the Research Institute for Cultural Heritage and Tourism. “The delineation process is being pursued sensitively in such a way that no traces of the ancient relics could be found outside the boundaries whether on the surface or underground,” said Jafari. Under the Sasanians (224–651), Iranian art experienced a general renaissance. Architecture often took grandiose proportions, such as the palaces at Ctesiphon, Firuzabad and Saravan.
