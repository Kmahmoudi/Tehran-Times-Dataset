TEHRAN – Despite women’s low rate of economic contribution which stands at 12 percent, it seems that they play an outstanding role in different sections so that unofficial employment rate among women is high, vice president for women’s and family affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar has said.
 Home jobs and small businesses which are mainly done by women are not recorded in official statistics, IRNA quoted Ebtekar as saying. In line with increasing women’s employment rate Ebtekar emphasized that real statistics about women’s employment should be clarified. She went on to say that empowering and training women for small businesses are essential. Ebtekar put stress on serious efforts to be made for paving the way for educated women to work on start-ups. The vice president also requested the municipalities to support young girls for creating new businesses and start-ups. The official called for formation of start-up homes in order to teach business, trade and information technology to young women, adding that digital revolution is a useful device for improving women’s employment. A project entitled “The route into my business” is performed in all 31 provinces, for women’s entrepreneurship, said Ebtekar, noting it is an important step taken toward women’s employment. A total number of 780 women have received primary trainings in 31 provinces, she explained. Ebtekar hoped for removing employment gap between women and men with the efforts to be made by diligent Iranian girls. Women make up some half of 80 million population of Iran.
