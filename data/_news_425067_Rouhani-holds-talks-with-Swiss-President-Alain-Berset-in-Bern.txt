TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his Swiss counterpart, Alain Berset, held talks on issues of common interest and explored ways to strengthen Tehran-Bern relations in various fields.
 During a meeting in Bern late on Monday, the two presidents stressed that there is no obstacle to the enhancement of ties, and that the two countries are determined to employ all means to that end. The Iranian president also underlined the need for dialogue between the two countries over important regional and global issues. Rouhani further touched on Iran’s regional role and said Tehran’s foreign policy is based on “cooperation and friendship with its neighbors.” The Islamic Republic, he added, has “never sparked tensions in the region.” He also described the 2015 nuclear agreement as a “multilateral, international agreement” and said the U.S. withdrawal from the accord proved that Washington is not committed to its international obligations. Switzerland reaffirms support for nuclear agreement The Swiss president expressed satisfaction with the growing Tehran-Bern relations, especially in the field of science. He also reaffirmed Switzerland’s support for the nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), noting that all countries should work to preserve the accord, which is the outcome of a lengthy diplomatic process and has been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. The Swiss president says all countries should work to preserve the JCPOA, which is the outcome of a lengthy diplomatic process and has been endorsed by the UN Security Council. The duo were then joined by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Swiss counterpart, Ignazio Cassis, who had held a separate meeting earlier. Cutting Iran’s oil would mean cutting region’s oil Also at a meeting with a number of Iranian expatriates in Switzerland on Monday, Rouhani said the U.S. wants to fully prevent the export of Iranian oil, a move that the president said is impossible to implement because in that case no country in the region can export oil. “It would be meaningless that Iran cannot export its oil while others in the region can. Do this if you can and see its consequences," Rouhani asserted. “We told all our foreign parties that if they speak to the Iranian nation with the language of logic and respect, then we can get problems solved... and that threats, pressure and humiliation will never work against the people of Iran," the president pointed out. In relation to the U.S. exit from the nuclear deal with Iran, Rouhani said, "Iran's logic has not changed, one party without logic has left the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with the goal of putting pressure on the Iranian nation." From Switzerland, the Iranian president will travel to Austria where he will meet President Alexander Van der Bellen and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and oversee the signing of some documents for cooperation. A key subject on the agenda, however, is a package which the Europeans are expected to offer to Iran in order to keep the country in the JCPOA. Iran, Switzerland sign cooperation documents During Rouhani’s trip, Iran and Switzerland signed three cooperation documents. They signed documents for cooperation in various sectors, including health and science spheres, as well as road transportation.
