TEHRAN – Some 400 illegal mist nets for catching birds have been destroyed and cleared from some areas of Babolsar and Fereydunkenar in Mazandaran province, northern part of the country, the provincial department of environment (DOE) chief has said. Mist nets are fine nets that are suitable for capturing birds in woodlands. The fine net is strung across trees so as to lie in the flight path of a bird.
