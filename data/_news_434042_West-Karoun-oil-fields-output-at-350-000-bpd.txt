TEHRAN- Production of oil from West Karoun oilfields has reached 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the current Iranian calendar year (ends on March 20), the managing director of Iran’s Petroleum Engineering and Development Company (PEDEC) told IRIB in an interview. Touraj Dehqani said the figure shows 50,000 bpd rise from the daily production in the past year and is planned to reach 400,000 bpd in the next year. West Karoun oilfields which Iran shares with Iraq at the western part of Iran’s southwestern region of Karoun include five major fields namely North Azadegan, South Azadegan, North Yaran, South Yaran and Yadavaran. West Karoun holds great importance for the country’s oil industry since according to the latest studies, its in-situ deposit is estimated to be 67 billion barrels containing both light and heavy crude oils, and therefore it could have a big impact on Iran’s oil output increases in the future. With the fields fully operational, their output could add 1.2 million bpd to the country’s oil production capacity. Having an estimated 67 billion barrels of in-situ oil, West Karoun fields definitely deserve the spotlight which has been put on them recently.
