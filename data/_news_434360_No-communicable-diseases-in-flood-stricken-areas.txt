TEHRAN- No communicable diseases have been spotted in areas hit by the flood, all around the country, announced the director of Communicable Diseases Department at the Ministry of Health.  Following heavy rainfalls in the country particularly in provinces of Golestan, Mazandaran, Lorestan, and Khuzestan as well as other provinces in western, southwestern, and northeastern Iran severe flood struck many cities and villages. According to Mohammad Mahdi Guya, all flood-stricken areas are under complete supervision, IRIB reported on Monday.  Guya further noted that water and food sources in villages hit by the flood are normally at risk of getting contaminated, so it is highly important to take necessary actions to prevent the transmission of diseases from such sources.  SJ/MQ/MG    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
