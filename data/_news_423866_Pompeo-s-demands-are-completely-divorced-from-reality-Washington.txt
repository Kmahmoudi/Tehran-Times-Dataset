In a commentary on Tuesday the Washington Post said the new U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s demands from Iran “are completely divorced from reality”.
 The Post said those who are familiar with Iran know that it is “fantastical” to expect Iran to capitulate to such demands. Following is an expert of the commentary titled “Pompeo gives a silly speech on Iran”: Mike Pompeo used his first speech as secretary of state on Monday to send a message directly to the Iranian leadership and its people: “Do what we want, or else!” Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, Pompeo rattled off a 12-point list of what he called “basic requirements” of a new way forward with Iran (really little more than a rehashing of the decades-old laundry list of Washington’s beefs with the country). Pompeo wants Iran to give up its ballistic missile program, cease and desist its involvement in every country it’s currently involved in, completely shut down its nuclear enrichment, and at the same time release Americans imprisoned in Iran — all just because we say so. These demands are completely divorced from reality. If Iran would only capitulate on all 12 points, Pompeo declared, it could look forward to rejoining what Pompeo referred to as the “league of nations.” (Note: The League of Nations, the precursor of today’s United Nations, existed from 1920 to 1946.) Pompeo, though, promised that Iran would face the toughest economic sanctions in history if it fails to comply. “After our sanctions come into full force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive,” he said. “Iran will be forced to make a choice - either fight to keep its economy off life support at home or keep squandering precious wealth on fights abroad. It will not have the resources to do both.” What remains entirely unclear is how the Trump administration plans to pull this off without the support of key U.S. allies in the European Union who are all committed to remaining in the nuclear deal with Iran and ramping up commercial ties with it.
