TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday dismissed as oblivious the recent remarks by French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, who accused Iran and Russia of following a “dead-end” strategy in Syria.

 Ayrault said on Sunday that Russia and Iran would become “accomplices in war crimes” if they “continued to prolong the war in Syria”. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Wednesday said, “It is to be regretted that the remarks of the French foreign minister, despite knowledge which he should have of regional and global developments, are unrealistic and unexpected.” He said, “Iran’s spiritual influence in regional countries is being put to use to fight terrorists whose crimes are intimately known to some Western countries, particularly France.”  Ayrault had described Russia and Iran as supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and called on them "to take their responsibility by stopping this strategy that leads to a dead-end." Qassemi dismissed the West’s perception of Iran’s role in Syria, saying, “They should have already realized that they should not ask Iran to use its influence against those who are fighting global terrorism at the forefront.” SP/PA
