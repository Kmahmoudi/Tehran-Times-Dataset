TEHRAN – Judiciary spokesman Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i said on Monday that those who have committed suicide in prisons may have done so in order to avoid disclosing information. Ruling out that all the suicides were committed due to pressure in prisons, Mohseni-Eje'i said, “Sometimes those who are members of an organization or those who have committed serious crimes commit suicide to prevent disclosure of their information.” He also pointed to the case of some environmentalists, saying they were under no pressure in prison, adding that the reason behind the suicides are still a mystery, ISNA reported.
