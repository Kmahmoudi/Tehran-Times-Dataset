TEHRAN – The chairman of the Iranian Parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission says the airstrike on Syria by the U.S. and its allies was aimed at defending Washington’s “lost dignity”. “The aggression by the United States, Britain, and France against Syria as a member of the United Nations is condemnable,” Alaeddin Boroujerdi said on Saturday, Tasnim reported. He also called on the UN Security Council to convene an extraordinary meeting to examine various dimensions of “the blatant aggression”, stressing that Russia and China can request for such a meeting.
