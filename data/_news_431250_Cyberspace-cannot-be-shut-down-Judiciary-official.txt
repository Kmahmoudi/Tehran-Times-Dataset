TEHRAN – The Judiciary chief’s cultural deputy believes that not all of the activities that people do in social media apps such as Telegram are criminal and that the people need social media for different reasons. “Both good and bad activities are done in cyberspace,” IRNA on Saturday quoted Hadi Sadeqi as saying. “Cyberspace cannot be shut down, because people need it… The government has the duty to facilitate positive usage of cyberspace,” Sadeqi added.  He also said Iran’s enemies exploit cyberspace to commit criminal activities against the country.
