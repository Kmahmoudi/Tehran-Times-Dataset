TEHRAN – Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi announced on Monday that more than 300 terrorist acts were foiled and 11 terrorist groups were disbanded during the Arbaeen march, Mehr reported. Alavi also pointed to the hegemonic powers’ animosity toward the Islamic Republic, saying such enmity is not because of human rights, women’s rights and the like, but due to Iran’s “political independence” and “regional influence”. The enemies have failed to reach their goals, he said, adding, “Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran, with the guidance of the Leader of the Revolution, is more powerful and thriving than ever.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
