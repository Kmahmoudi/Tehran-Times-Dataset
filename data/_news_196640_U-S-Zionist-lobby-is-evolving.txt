For more than half a century, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has been the premier pro-Israel lobbying group in the U.S. Since its inception in 1951, AIPAC has been instrumental in shaping American foreign policy to promote the Israeli position on the Middle East conflict and other world issues. Once a small organization with a handful of staff, AIPAC grew substantially during the Ronald Reagan presidency and afterward, and today has more than 100,000 members. AIPAC, which now lobbies both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government, proudly states on its website that it conducts more than 2,000 interviews with members of Congress each year, resulting in about 100 pro-Israel policy decisions.
