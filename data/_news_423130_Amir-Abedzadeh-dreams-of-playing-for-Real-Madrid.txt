TEHRAN – Iranian Marítimo goalkeeper Amir Abedzadeh admits he 'dreams' of playing for Real Madrid. The 25-year-old goalkeeper is the son of former Iranian national team goalkeeper Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh. “My main goal is playing in Spain especially for Real Madrid. I've always liked to play for the Galacticos since I was a child. I take it seriously and talk to myself every day about that,” Abedzadeh said in an interview with Observador. Abedzadeh, who will probably be a Team Melli member in the 2018 World Cup, says Iran have a chance of advancing to the competition’s next stage. Iran have been drawn in Group B along with Morocco, Portugal and Spain. “Four years ago, Costa Rica qualified for the next stage in a tough group consisting of Uruguay, Italy and England,” the goalie added. “Iran could also advance to the next stage. Why not? Everything is possible in football. We must believe in ourselves,” Abedzadeh explained.  “In 2014, we lost to Argentina in the last minutes of the match. If we had not conceded Lionel Messi’s goal, we could have celebrated a historic result. Team Melli defeated two-time South American champions Chile 2-0 in a friendly. Therefore, we are capable of ensuring a place in Round of 16. We have so many good players who play with their hearts. Iran also take advantage of a good coach,” Abedzadeh stated.  “Carlos Quaeiroz has a big character. He is the man who took us to two World Cups in a row. In addition, he is a leader in the world. Queiroz has taught me so many tricks,” he concluded. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
