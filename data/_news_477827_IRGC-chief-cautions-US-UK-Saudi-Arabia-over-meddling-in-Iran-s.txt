TEHRAN- The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has issued a stark warning against any outside meddling in Iran’s internal affairs, stressing that doing so will result in the enemy suffering a devastating blow. Major General Hossein Salami sounded the alarm while speaking to a group of academics, teachers, and students at Qom Seminary on Thursday to denounce the recent unrest in Iran. After Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman of Kurdish descent, died suddenly in a hospital three days after fainting at a Tehran police station despite resuscitation attempts and intense medical treatment, violent demonstrations erupted across the country. As soon as Amini died on September 16, Western media outlets and Saudi-funded television networks seized the opportunity to make the unconvincing allegation that she had been "murdered" by police. Iran promptly made public the CCTV footage of the young woman collapsing and then being taken to hospital. Iranian officials looked into the matter as well and came to the conclusion that Amini's death was brought on by a disease rather than rumors of beatings. Salami issued a severe warning to Iran's adversaries, saying, "Stop meddling in our country's domestic affairs." “I advise the Saudi regime to seek shelter in your glass palaces. This is a warning from us. Your home is constructed of spider webs,” the IRGC chief warned. Regarding Saudi Arabia's anti-Iran campaign during the recent riots, the head commander of the IRGC remarked, “You have depended on Israel, which is falling, and this is your fate.” “Americans and the British should also know and stop doing this. You have not been able to implement the sanctions, you hit the ships, we also hit them, whatever move you make against the Iranian nation, you will receive blows several times,” The IRGC commander highlighted.  The top general cited the adversaries' back-to-back setbacks in front of the Iranian people, asserting that they had also failed to achieve their objectives in their most recent endeavors.
