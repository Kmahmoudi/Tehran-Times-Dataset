TEHRAN – Iran has once again reiterated its stance on the need to eliminate nuclear weapons, underlining that they pose a serious threat to humanity. “I would like to reaffirm the global responsibility towards nuclear disarmament as a priority while paying homage to the victims of nuclear weapons at the hands of the U.S. twice in 1945,” Reza Najafi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs, said at the High-Level Plenary Meeting of the UN General Assembly to Promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear-Weapons. He said, “The threat to humanity by nuclear weapons is serious, and unfortunately, the possibility of their use is high. Relying on nuclear deterrence, lowering the threshold, its arms race, nuclear sharing and the vivid cases of threats to use, the existence of almost 13,000 nuclear warheads in the arsenals maintained and modernized, all prove to be a type of iceberg for the magnitude of this threat.” Najafi added, “The US withdrawal from the INF spelled an end to the commitment to eliminate an entire class of nuclear missiles. Similarly, its withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 proved it has no respect for its international commitments. We believe that the extension of the new START should be followed by a concrete agreement on nuclear disarmament. It should be noted with grave concern that the US Government, at the global level, and the illegitimate entity of the Israeli regime, at the regional level, are the main hindrances in moving toward nuclear disarmament.” He stated, “Iran is of the view that the use of nuclear weapons anywhere, in any way and under any circumstances is a grave violation of international law and a crime against humanity. We strongly support the NAM proposal to commence in the CD a comprehensive convention encompassing the entire cycle of nuclear weapons. Based on Article VI of the NPT, nuclear disarmament is the legal, political and moral obligation, particularly for Nuclear Weapon States. The only guarantee to ensure that nuclear weapons will never be used again is their total elimination.” Najafi pointed out, “Unfortunately, the failure of the 10th NPT Review Conference and the lack of political will among NWSs diminished any prospect to commence meaningful negotiations on nuclear disarmament. The so-called nuclear risk reduction cannot substitute real disarmament.” He concluded, “We reiterate our call to hold the NWSs accountable and compel Israel to dismantle its nuclear arsenal, promptly accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon party without any preconditions and place all of its nuclear facilities under the IAEA’s full-scope safeguards. This will pave the way for the establishment of a WMDs Free Zone in the Middle East. Iran’s commitment and contribution to nuclear disarmament remain steadfast. We appreciate the statement of the UN Secretary General and align ourselves with the NAM statement to be made by Azerbaijan.” In August, reiterated its opposition to nuclear weapons, describing their existence as the greatest threat to humanity that has only intensified after the recent developments in Europe. Asadollah Eshragh Jahromi, director general for International Peace and Security at the Iranian Foreign Ministry, made the remarks in a statement on Sunday to the Tenth NPT Review Conference in New York. “The Islamic Republic of Iran is of the firm belief that the continued existence of nuclear weapons poses the greatest threat to humanity that due to the recent developments in Europe, has even intensified. The outcome of this Conference should reflect our deep concern about any use or threat to use nuclear weapons and declare that any use of such weapons is a crime against humanity and a violation of international law,” Eshragh Jahromi said. He added, “In 1996, the ICJ affirmed that nuclear-weapon States have an explicit obligation and special responsibility for achieving nuclear disarmament. To fulfill the mandate of this Committee, and to evaluate the implementation of article VI, it is necessary to examine whether the actions and policies of the nuclear-weapon States since 2010 have demonstrated a commitment to and compliance with the objective of article VI of the Treaty.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
