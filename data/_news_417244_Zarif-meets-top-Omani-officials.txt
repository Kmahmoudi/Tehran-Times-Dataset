TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met in Muscat on Monday with Sultan of Oman Qaboos bin Said al Said and his Omani counterpart Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdallah.
 Zarif left Oman for Qatar on Monday. Prior to his meeting with the Sultan of Oman, Zarif told reporters that Iran and Oman have very good relations in various spheres. Commenting on the 2015 nuclear deal, he said that the European Union and the international community supports the agreement. He added Iran will not be the first to violate the nuclear deal, however, the country has various options if the agreement is breeched. The nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was signed in July 2015 and went into effect in January 2016. During his speech at the UN General Assembly last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that he may not recertify the agreement when it comes up for review by a mid-October deadline, in which case the U.S. Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the accord. Except the U.S. under Donald Trump, all other signatories to the nuclear deal – France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China and the European Union - have been insisting on the full implementation of the multilateral agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231.
