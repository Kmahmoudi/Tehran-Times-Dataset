TEHRAN â€“ The nuclear agreement serves as a test by which Iran would decide whether it can trust the other parties, MP Kazem Jalali said on Sunday. In a meeting with Swiss Ambassador to Tehran Markus Leitner, Jalali said the landmark deal could be a starting point for cooperation and confidence in the opposing parties. He criticized the U.S. government for its lack of commitment to the deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The lawmaker also said Iran is capable of holding talks to solve regional problems, emphasizing the preservation of the JCPOA is key to further cooperation.
