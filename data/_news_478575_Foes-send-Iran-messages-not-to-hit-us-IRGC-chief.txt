TEHRAN - The adversary is "scared" and "on alert," according to the head commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), since it frequently sends signals to Iran appealing with the country not to retaliate militarily. The comments were delivered by Major General Hossein Salami on Friday during a ceremony honoring Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, regarded as the pioneer of Iran's missile program, on the occasion of his 11th anniversary of martyrdom. "Enemies no longer enjoy tranquility and are on high alert as of late. They are terrified and keep giving us signals that say, "Do not target us," he added, adding that “Iran has received these statements from a number of other countries.” The commander pointed to the violent riots that were instigated by the West after the death of young woman Mahsa Amini and said, "The adversary seeks to engage Iran with internal turmoil so as to distract it from lofty aspirations." “Those sitting in glass houses in Riyadh, Tel Aviv, New York, and Paris are architects of riots.”“Under these conditions, we launched a satellite-carrying rocket, tested the Bavar-373 missile system with a range of 300 km, and announced yesterday (Thursday) that we have developed a new (hypersonic) missile that no missile defense system is able to confront. We also held a significant military exercise along the Aras River. The commander also cited mass participation at the demonstrations around the country last week to commemorate the anniversary of the U.S. embassy takeover as evidence that people had turned away from their adversaries' ideologies. “The enemy always shatters itself by its own mistakes. This time also, we will defeat them using their mistake,” he said, adding, “The Iranian nation is changing the enemy’s calculations.” He emphasized that while the Iranian nation is active and controls its own destiny, the adversary wants a dependent Iran with no religion. He went on to say, “Enemies should know that if they targeted one of us, we will target all of them. You targeted our Qassem Soleimani but we will target all of you and expel you from the region.” “Those sitting in glass houses in Riyadh, Tel Aviv, New York, and Paris are architects of riots,” he underlined. "By making a mistake, the enemy thought it could fight the grandeur of a major global revolution by deploying a number of deluded youngsters who are our precious children," stated the general, who also said that the enemy's crimes will not go unpunished. Midway through September, after the contentious death of Mahsa Amini, riots erupted in Iran. The 22-year-old fell down inside a police station in Tehran, the country's capital, and was eventually declared dead at a hospital three days later. According to an official assessment by Iran's Forensic Medicine Organization, Amini died from a disease rather than blows to her head or other critical organs. Meanwhile, rioters have been rampaging around the country with strong backing from Western nations, including the United States, despite viciously assaulting security personnel and actively damaging public property. On October 28, the Iranian Intelligence Ministry and the IRGC Intelligence Organization issued a statement to emphasize the significant role that foreign spy agencies, particularly the CIA, had in orchestrating the violent insurgencies. The Intelligence Ministry revealed late last month that Western governments and its mercenary media had supported the riots, spreading false information and distorting the chain of events that resulted in Amini's death even before the official inquiry into the incident was completed.
