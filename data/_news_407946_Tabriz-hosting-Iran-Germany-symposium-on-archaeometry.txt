TEHRAN – The first Irano-German International Symposium on Archaeometry opened in the Iranian city of Tabriz on November 1, turning the spotlight on the involvement of physical and biological sciences with archaeology and the history of arts. Experts, academics, and university students from both nations exchange views and present articles on archaeological dating methods and conservation knowledge as well as man and his environment during the four-day event which is being held at the Tabriz Islamic Arts University. The event is organized under the auspices of German Archaeological Institute in close collaboration with Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization. It also embraces discussions in regard to artifact studies, mathematical methods, and remote sensing techniques. Conference papers and proceedings will be indexed in the Civilica database and Iranian Consortium of National Content (ICNC) as well.   Tabriz, the capital of East Azarbaijan Province, boasts a rich collection of prehistorical and ancient sites as well as natural beauties. Last year, the World Crafts Council picked Tabriz as world city of carpets.
