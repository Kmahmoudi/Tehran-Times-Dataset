TEHRAN- For the interim cease-fire to continue, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has urged the UN to work toward easing the debilitating Saudi embargo on Yemen and establish a sincere political engagement between the warring sides.
 Amir Abdollahian made the comment during a meeting with Martin Griffiths, the UN's Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting. “The UN is expected to direct due attention at the lifting of the inhumane blockade against the Yemeni nation and also work towards real political negotiations between representatives of all Yemeni parties in order for the current ceasefire to uphold,” he stressed.  He also expressed gratitude to the top UN official for his efforts in enabling Tehran to continue supporting global humanitarian initiatives to lessen the suffering. The two sides also discussed current political events, as well as the humanitarian situation in Syria and Afghanistan. "Despite the fact that currently there are nearly five million Afghan refugees in Iran and that many Afghans cross the border into Iran every day, the United Nations has thus far failed to provide any humanitarian assistance to this large population, especially the recently arrived refugees," Amir Abdollahian asserted. The Iranian foreign minister also emphasized the need to give humanitarian help equally to all Syrians and international humanitarian groups paying close attention to the plight of the Syrian people. He said that although civilians in the war-torn Arab nation suffer from a shortage of power and safe drinking water, terrorists and Takfiri militants stationed in the northwest province of Idlib are in a very different position. Amir Abdollahian went into further detail on Iran's attempts to halt the Russia-Ukraine war and stressed the importance of paying particular attention to the plight of Ukrainian refugees. For his part, Griffiths complimented Iran for its generosity toward Afghan refugees and cited Iran as a special case in the world for welcoming and supporting refugees. He also commended Iran for its fair attention to the Ukrainian problem and said that political engagement was essential to sustain the ceasefire in Yemen and bring about economic stability to the country. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, spokesman for the Yemeni armed forces, has warned international corporations against continuing to pillage the nation's natural resources. In a tweet on his Twitter page, Saree stated, “We demand foreign firms looting Yemen’s natural wealth to pay serious attention to the warning made by the leader of the popular Ansarullah resistance movement, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi.” The Houthis have emphasized that international corporations participating in the theft of Yemen's natural resources were complicit in the attack against the nation by the Saudi-led coalition. The leader of Yemen's Supreme Political Council, Mahdi al-Mashat, also declared that the people of Yemen would not keep silent over the theft of their natural resources, which Saudi mercenaries use to launch businesses and purchase property abroad. Together with its Arab allies, the U.S. and other Western countries provided Saudi Arabia with munitions and logistical support when it began its destructive war against Yemen in March 2015. Despite the fact that the Saudi-led coalition has not succeeded in achieving any of its goals, the war has killed hundreds of thousands of Yemenis and caused the greatest humanitarian disaster in modern history.
