He referred to the defense Ministry's-affiliated organs' research, industrial and manufacturing capabilities, including test-firing of the missile, as preventive measures in line with strengthening of national security, IRNA reported. Speaking at a gathering of officials of Aerospace Organization, Shamkhani said hardware capabilities are not adequate for preserving Security. "We need to increase our efforts in rendering services to people which will in turn play a crucial role in defensive affairs of the country." He also alluded to 'resistance' as the best approach to thwart foreign threats adding "the international situation does not condone the trend of unilateralism and will resist it." The essence of resistance is production of power which should be generated in various domains including "domestic, international and defense areas." Shamkhani further referred to people's participation in the societal affairs "as the best manner to garner power domestically." He said the next election should witness higher turnout of people, "than the previous 25 million that took part in the previous election." Iran, in order to resist threats will wage a campaign to attain an indigenous defense system, Shamkhani underlined.
