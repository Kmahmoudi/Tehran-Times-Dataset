The Players of Team Melli showed a brave performance in Russia and earned the respect of the football world. Of course, there was also critics about the defensive football style of Iran, but this was the only way to get result. Iran played highly physical in their pressing game and aimed to destroy the rival possession game. In the first match, Iran controlled the match and tried to use their dangerous counter-attack players. But we saw that Team Melli couldn’t use the counter-attack like they wanted. Therefore the main attack plan was to use free-kicks. And Iran used all free-kicks for dangerous set pieces and both goals of the tournament resulted after free-kicks. Iran have been using highly compact block defense in World Cup with no presence in the rival half. With such a coverage it had been difficult for their opponents to build a dangerous attack. Especially against Spain all players of Iran were full in defense duties. Iniesta, Costa and Silva found themselves stuck in between Iran’s defense lines being isolated from their teammates. Both central backs, Morteza Pouraliganji and Majid Hosseini, showed a great performance, especially against Diego Costa and C. Ronaldo. In the last match we saw a big fight. The Team Melli boys fought like real patriots. They wanted to use the chance to advance to the next round. And with a little bit luck Iran could be the surprise of the tournament. Of course not everything was perfect. Iran’s major problem was lack of attacking partnership and support. Sardar Azmoun was alone and isolated.   I am also surprised about the critics on Azmoun. He fought like a real patriot in every match for his team. This way it is normal that he couldn’t show his qualities with ball. erdar Azmoun is the best central forward in Asia, doesn’t matter who criticize him. Team Melli showed us again that you don’t need Big Stars to show that your Team is a Star!   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
