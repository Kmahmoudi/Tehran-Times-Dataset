TEHRAN — The prevalence of multiple sclerosis, also known as MS, has been rising in Iran over the recent years, the secretary of the 13th international MS congress of Iran has said. Vitamin D deficiency, smoking cigarette and hookah, infections and change of diet over the past 20 years are known as the main contributory factor behind developing MS, Tasnim news agency quoted Abdolreza Nasser-Moqaddasi as saying. Iran is geographically situated in a high risk region where there are greater chances of developing MS, Nasser-Moqaddasi warned, adding, as the disease is more likely to develop in youngsters it is really important to address the disorder properly. Thankfully, the distribution of vitamin D supplement at schools has been a crucial step towards preventing the disease, he suggested. He went on to say that “taking measures to tackle the problem of smoking among youngsters particularly women can also contribute to fighting MS.” The 13th international MS congress of Iran will be held on November 9 to 11 in Tehran. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination.
