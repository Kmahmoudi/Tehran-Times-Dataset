TEHRAN – An informed source has denied reports about a missile attack on an Iranian military base in Syria and deaths of Iranian military advisers in the Arab country, Tasnim reported on Monday. “All these reports over attack on an Iranian military base in Syria and the martyrdom of several Iranian military advisers in Syria are baseless,” the unnamed source told Tasnim. The Syrian army said on Sunday that rockets had struck several military bases in the Hama and Aleppo countryside. In a news flash, state television said the missile attacks took place at 10:30 p.m. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
