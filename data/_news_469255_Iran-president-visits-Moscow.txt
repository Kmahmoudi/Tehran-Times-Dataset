TEHRAN – Iranian President Ayatollah Seyed Ebrahim Raisi arrived in Moscow on Wednesday morning at the invitation of his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.  The visit is intended to deepen economic, political and cultural interactions between Iran and Russia, according to the official website of the Iranian presidency. The ministers of foreign affairs, petroleum and economy are accompanying Raisi on the trip. The president’s agenda in Russia includes meeting with the Russian president, addressing the Duma, and meeting Iranian expatriates in Russia. Speaking on Wednesday before leaving for Russia at Mehrabad Airport, Raisi said, "This trip is done at the invitation of the president of Russia and in order to promote neighborhood and regional diplomacy." The president also said, "We seek to establish and strengthen relations with all neighbors, especially Russia in various political, economic and trade fields, and this trip can be a turning point to improve and strengthen relations with Russia." Calling the Islamic Republic and Russia as two independent, important, powerful and influential countries in the region, the president said, "Cooperation and talks between the two important, powerful and influential countries can be effective in improving regional security and economic and trade relations.” Political ties between Iran and Russia have been strengthened in recent years. The two countries backed the government of Bashar al-Assad in the fight against terrorists and are now mediating between the Damascus government and the opposition groups. Iran also joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in September 2021 which was first established by China, Russia and some former Soviet republics in 2001.  President Raisi said, "In the Shanghai Summit, we will establish good cooperation with all countries, especially Russia. Russia also plays a key role in the Eurasian Union, and cooperation between the two countries in this regard can lead to effective steps to promote trade and economic issues." Stating that Iran and Russia share common interests, Ayatollah Raisi said, "The existence of common and interactive interests between Tehran and Moscow in the region provides security and will prevent unilateralism in the world. Also, interaction and mutual cooperation between the two countries can affect the regional and international situation." Referring to the vast potential for cooperation between Tehran and Moscow in various political, economic and energy sectors, the president said, "The current level of trade and economic cooperation is not satisfactory for either country and needs to be upgraded to a much higher level. We hope that this trip will be an effective step towards securing the common interests of the two countries, which are influential at regional and global scenes."   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
