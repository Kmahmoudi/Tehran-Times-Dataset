TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said on Thursday that Iran sees a good prospect for cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
 “We take actions within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s charter, the Additional Protocol and Safeguards Agreements. So far, the Islamic Republic of Iran has made any efforts to remain committed to its obligations and uphold its rights,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony held to commemorate best entrepreneurs. “The cooperation between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency has been very good so far and we hope that this process would be continued,” Salehi remarked. He also said that all the IAEA inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities are done within a specified framework. Commenting on buying 900 tons of yellow cake, the nuclear chief, “We signed an agreement with Mr. Moniz [the former U.S. secretary of energy] and the 5+1 group which was confirmed and signed in the last meeting with Mr. Moniz in Frankfurt, but unfortunately one of the countries, I mean Britain, violated the agreement at the last moments and the issue is being pursued by the Foreign Ministry.” NA
