TEHRAN- Some 8,000 children under age five will be vaccinated against polio in southeastern Iran, said the head of the communicable diseases department at the Ministry of Health.  The vaccination is on a house to house basis, Mohammad-Mehdi Gooya said, adding the first round of the plan was implemented from January 26 to 29 and the second round is due from February 23 to 26, IRNA reported on Saturday.  According to Gooya, no incidence of polio has been reported in Iran over the past 18 years; however, due to Iran’s geographical location, bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan in the east, there are some concerns that the disease may find its way back into the country.  The polio vaccination will then be performed in northern areas due to the commuting flows across the borders, he noted.  Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious viral disease, which mainly affects young children. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g. contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and can cause paralysis.
