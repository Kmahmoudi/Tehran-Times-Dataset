TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani on Friday condemned in the strongest terms a terrorist attack that targeted a training center in west Kabul, Afghanistan. “The deadly attack against innocent the young participating in a scientific exam is a savage move that violates religious teachings and primary human principles,” Kanaani said in a statement.  The spokesman said Afghanistan’s caretaker government bears the responsibility for ensuring the security of its citizens. He also expressed condolences with the families of the victims and wished the wounded a speedy recovery.  A suicide blast at an education institute in Kabul on Friday morning killed 32 people and wounded 40, police said. Most of the casualties were said to be young women. The explosion happened inside the center in the Dashti Barchi neighborhood of Kabul, said Khalid Zadran, the Taliban-appointed spokesman for the Kabul police chief. Many of those living in the western area where the blast occurred are Hazara, an ethnic minority targeted in past attacks launched by Daesh militant group, among others. “A blast took place inside an institute, the blast has [caused] casualties,” Kabul police spokesperson Khalid Zadran told Reuters. Security officials had arrived in the area to investigate, he added. Hassan Kazemi Qomi, Iran's envoy for Afghanistan, said the global arrogance and those who claim to defend women’s rights are behind the Kabul attack. He said on Twitter that Iran condemns the attack and expects the Taliban to make sure that such attacks won't happen again.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
