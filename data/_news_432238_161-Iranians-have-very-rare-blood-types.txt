A person’s blood type is considered ‘very rare’ if only one person in 10,000 has or lacks similar blood antigens.  “We selected a group of people with rare and very rare blood types based on our requirements and facilities; then we refrigerated samples of their blood, so that we can use them whenever a patient in any healthcare center needed such rare blood types,” Hajibaigi explained.   “By using the refrigerated samples, we managed to send 121 samples of rare or very rare blood types to the patients who needed them since the beginning of last year [March 2017],” he further noted.  According to Hajibaigi, the IBTO has set up blood bank refrigerators in the immunohematology departments and is running the “national plan of rare blood types” to ensure that patients who need rare blood types will have instant access to them.   He added that the blood bank refrigerators will soon be equipped with a data storage system so that a comprehensive network of data about people with rare and very rare blood types are established.  SJ/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
