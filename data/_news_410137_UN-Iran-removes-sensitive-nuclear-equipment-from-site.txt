The chief of the UN atomic agency says Iran has complied with a key commitment of its nuclear deal with six world powers by removing sensitive equipment from a strategic underground site, AP reported.
 Yukiya Amano of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday that Tehran has met a deadline and taken “excess centrifuges and infrastructure” from the Fordo uranium enrichment facility. While more than 1,000 centrifuges can remain at Fordo according to the deal, they must be used for research and other non-enrichment purposes. PA/PA
