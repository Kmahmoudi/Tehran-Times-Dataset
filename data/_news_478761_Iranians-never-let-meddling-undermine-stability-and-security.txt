TEHRAN- Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has reiterated that Iranians will never permit foreigner or their hired terrorists to meddle with Iran’s national interests or threaten its security. In a phone call with Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic late on Tuesday, Amir Abdollahian expressed gratitude for his sympathy message on the terrorist attack on the Shah Cheragh shrine in Shiraz by a Daesh agent. In the attack on the shrine on October 26, 13 pilgrims lost their lives and 30 others wound. A small boy lost all members of his family. Noting that Iran is a victim of terrorism and extremism, the foreign minister said Iran “has always been a pioneer of campaign against this malignant phenomenon in the region and the international scenes, and dedicated many martyrs, including Martyr Qassem Soleimani in that campaign.”  The Iranian foreign minister continued, “Unfortunately, some oppressor countries that claim to be the forerunners of the campaign against terrorism, and have lost hope in imposing the most severe sanctions against the Iranian nation, are now trying to impose their deceitful policies by encouraging terrorism and aggressive moves in Iran.” “Such moves cannot break the will of the Islamic Republic of Iran in paving the path towards strength and advancement, and the Iranian nation, too, will not permit national interests and security be played with, by the foreign intruders and their mercenary terrorists," Amir Abdollahian remarked.  In his message the chief diplomat said the Islamic Republic will work with free and friendly nations, such as the Republic of Serbia, to advance a genuine campaign against the pernicious phenomenon of terrorism and the duplicitous actions of the oppressor powers.
