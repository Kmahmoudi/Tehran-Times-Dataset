TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday that Iran can be a “good” and “reliable” partner for South Africa in the West Asia region.
 During a meeting with South African National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete in Tehran, Zarif called South Africa a “friendly country” to Iran especially during the time of sanctions. He also called for expansion of cooperation in various spheres. For her part, Mbete welcomed expansion of relations especially banking ties. She said that the two countries have many capacities to expand cooperation. Mbete arrived in Tehran on Saturday. Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani and President Hassan Rouhani met her separately on Saturday. In a joint press conference with Larijani, Mbete said her country will make efforts to bring Iran to the club of BRICS which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. She said during the visit by the South African president to Tehran in April 2016 the issue of Iran’s membership in BRICS was raised and “we are interested in Iran’s membership… and believe that by inclusion of new countries” the bloc will see more economic development. The BRICS has become an important platform for exchanges and cooperation among the world's major emerging economies, brought real benefits for the member states and also a good reputation among the international community. The BRICS members are all leading developing or newly industrialized countries, but they are distinguished by their large, sometimes fast-growing economies and significant influence on regional affairs.
