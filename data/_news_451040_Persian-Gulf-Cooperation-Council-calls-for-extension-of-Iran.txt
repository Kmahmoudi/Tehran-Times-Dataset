In a report published by Bloomberg on Sunday, it is said that the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council has called on the United Nations Security Council to extend an arms embargo against Iran.
 In a letter to the Security Council sent Saturday and obtained by Bloomberg News, the PGCC called on the Security Council to extend the embargo and “further impose any additional measures necessary to prevent the destabilizing proliferation of Iranian weapons, such as a targeted asset freeze and travel ban on individuals involved in the supply, sale or transfer of arms or related materiel to or from Iran.” Sunday’s letter is the first significant joint statement released by the group since the rift, said a person familiar with the matter. The United States has stepped up calls for the extension of UN arms embargo on Iran since April. Under the UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal, arms embargo against Iran expires in October.
