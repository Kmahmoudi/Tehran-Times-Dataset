TEHRAN – A senior Iranian military official has revealed the extent of the cyberattacks Iran faced in the last few weeks, saying the country foiled 120 heavy cyberattacks over the last 20 days.  The official, Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali, who is the head of the Civil Defense Organization of Iran, pointed to the increase in the number of cyberattacks against Iran’s infrastructures over the last few weeks in a press conference held on Tuesday.  “120 heavy DDoS cyberattacks on the infrastructures have been foiled during the past 20 days,” he said, according to Tasnim.  DDoS, or distributed denial of service, is a type of cyberattack that tries to make a website or network resource unavailable by flooding it with malicious traffic so that it is unable to operate. The commander noted that homegrown systems have been utilized to thwart the cyberattacks, lauding the quality of the Iranian systems. Pointing to the enemy’s attempts to spread false information about the attacks, he said, “Such an extent of cyber threats has not been posed against any country so far. Ninety percent of them (the attacks on Iran) have been countered.” General Jalali also said that two or three cyberattacks have been launched recently against Iran’s fuel delivery infrastructures like the one in October 2021, noting that the hostile attacks have been repelled. “We are witnessing the heaviest media, cyber and cognitive attacks against Iran,” he stated, adding that any other country coming under such massive attacks would have been destroyed.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
