TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that the U.S. is seeking to undermine Iran’s “independence” and “democracy”, yet Washington has “desperately failed in its anti-Iran bid.” Speaking at a cabinet meeting in Tehran, Rouhani strongly criticized the U.S. government’s hostile policies which threaten Iran’s independence, saying only Iranians – and not the White House – have the right to determine Iran’s fate, ISNA reported. Pointing to his recent trip to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the president said, “What I felt during this trip was that the Americans, despite all the loud noise they made by imposing sanctions against Iran, are seeking only temporary pressure on Iran to gain a small political achievement inside the U.S.” He said the U.S. has failed and will fail to achieve its goals, praising Iran’s diplomats for their considerable successes at the UN which led to more isolation of the Trump administration in the world.  America is isolated in today’s world and no one has accepted or will accept its policies, he remarked. “Today, the world public opinion is in favor of Iran. Even inside America, many politicians and people consider Iran as being on the right path and do not approve of the U.S. government’s measures,” Rouhani said. “An overwhelming majority of the countries throughout the world supported BARJAM (the Persian acronym for the 2015 nuclear agreement) and praised Iran’s decision to save the deal, while condemning the U.S. sanctions against Iran as an illegal act,” the president stated. Rouhani further said the U.S. government’s violation of international commitments, its opposition to some international institutions – including Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court (ICC) – and its withdrawal from some trade deals were criticized by all states at the UNGA.
