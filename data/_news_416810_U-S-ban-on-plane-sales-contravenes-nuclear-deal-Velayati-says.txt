TEHRAN -- An advisor to Iran’s Leader said on Thursday the U.S. Congress’ move to block sales of aircraft to Iran is in violation of the nuclear deal clinched between Tehran and world powers in July 2015.

 “[Washington’s] blocking sale of planes to Iran is another reason why we shouldn’t rely on America and its allies,” Ali Akbar Velayati said.  He added, “The Islamic Republic of Iran doesn’t need American aircraft to achieve its objectives.” “During all the years since the [1979] Islamic Revolution, the West has never been kind to Iranian people, so what they did was not unexpected,” noted Velayati who was Iran’s foreign minister in the 1980s and 1990s. He reiterated said that Iran does not need American aircraft, and that it can meet its needs both locally and internationally. “So, we won’t get worried if they use pressure. We don’t regard such moves as pressure; rather, it’s just the Americans’ illusion, and they will get nowhere.”  Velayati added, “America’s move is a violation of the Iran nuclear deal. America’s nouveau riche president or Congress adopt a new measure on Iran every day, which shows we shouldn’t rely on America, and we don’t need them after all.”  The U.S. House of Representatives has voted in favor of new measures that block sales of commercial aircraft to Iran, ignoring some lawmakers’ warnings that the hostile move would undermine the 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and the six world powers.
