TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that the U.S. and its European allies are responsible for consequences of attacks on Syria.
 The U.S., UK and France fired about 100 missiles at Syria in the early hours of Saturday morning. The attack took place one week after a suspected chemical weapons attack in the Syrian town of Douma near Damascus. The attackers claimed the Syrian government was responsible for the attack. However, the government rejected the claim.  In a phone conversation with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Rouhani said, “This aggression was not just against the Syrian territory but against the whole region’s stability.” “Ignoring a country’s national sovereignty means efforts to cause instability and chaos in the region,” he added. He described the U.S.-led attacks as a “practical action” to boost terrorism in the region. “While the terrorists face defeats in Syria, this action by the three countries means support for the defeated terrorist groups,” he said. Rouhani also said that presence of the foreign forces in Syria without Damascus’ permission runs contrary to international law. He noted that no foreign country can decide about the future of Syria, saying that it is the Syrians who should decide for their country. The Iranian president highlighted the necessity of respecting Syria’s territorial integrity. He added Iran will stand beside the Syrian government and people. For his part, Assad praised Iran’s support for Syria. Assad said that the U.S.-led attacks will not affect the Syrians’ determination in fighting terrorists. The Syrian leader also noted that the attacks have had no achievement for the aggressors. “The aggressors took this action which is contrary to all international laws after failing to reach their objectives,” he said.
