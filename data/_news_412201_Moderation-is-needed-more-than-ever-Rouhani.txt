TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that the human of today needs moderation more than ever. During his speech at Moscow State University, he said that international determination is required to fight “roots of violence and extremism”. “Islamophobia, racism and Takfiri ideas have common roots,” he added. He also said, “Resolving the issues of today’s world requires cooperation among scientists and governments.” Elsewhere, Rouhani said, “The wane of the West’s dominance and the end of wealth monopoly are historic opportunities to build a new world.” Such structure has to turn the world into a safer place for all by using common human values as its basis, he added. Rouhani received an honorary doctorate from Moscow State University on Tuesday. Viktor Sadovnichiy, the rector of the Moscow State University, awarded the degree to the Iranian president and described it as a title awarded because of Rouhani’s efforts in boosting academic relations between the two countries.
