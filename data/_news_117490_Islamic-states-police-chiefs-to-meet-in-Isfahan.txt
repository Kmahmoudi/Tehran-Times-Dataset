The summit, which is being held on Iran’s initiative, is meant to help police forces of Islamic countries draw up a new strategy, General Morteza Najafi told the Tehran daily Hamshahri. Familiarizing police chiefs with the crimes and social disorders in Islamic countries and ways to combat them, evaluating the performance of police forces in observing human rights and civil rights, and promoting interaction among Islamic countries’ police forces are the main goals of the gathering, explained Najafi, who is the director of the meeting. Iran currently has police relations with 181 countries but not with Israel, he noted.
