TEHRAN - A security source in Nineveh province disclosed that at least nine notorious commanders of the ISIL terrorist group have left Mosul city for Syria along with their families, taking away millions of dollars. The Arabic language al-Sumeriyeh news quoted the source as saying that nine ISIL commanders, including Abu Ons al-Qahtani, the chief of Mujahedeen Council in Nineveh, and have escaped from Mosul with their families through the right bank of the Tigris River for the ISIL-held regions in Syria. Al-Sumeriyeh added that the fleeing commanders took with them a huge amount of money estimated at millions of dollars. A local source in Nineveh province disclosed in mid-December that ISIL's financial chief escaped the city of Mosul with important financial documents and a list of names of the terrorist group's commanders to become the third commander in charge of the terrorist group's financial affairs who disappears in less than two months. "Abu Qatadeh al-Qahtani, a senior official in charge of ISIL's financial affairs has left Mosul for an unknown destination while taking the terrorist group's important financial documents with himself," the Arabic-language media quoted the local source as saying. He said that Abu Qatadeh had access to all the documents of ISIL's financial transactions with companies and also the names of ISIL commanders in Iraq and Syria and those families who were being paid by the ISIL.
