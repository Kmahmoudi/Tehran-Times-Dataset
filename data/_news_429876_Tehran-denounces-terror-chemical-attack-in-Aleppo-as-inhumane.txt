TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Sunday strongly denounced the chemical attack launched by terrorists on civilians in the Syrian city of Aleppo. In a statement, Qassemi expressed deep regret and concern over the reports of the incident, describing the attack as “inhumane” and “despicable”, the Foreign Ministry website reported. “The cause of such an inhumane act is the unflinching political, financial and military support provided by some regional and trans-regional states for these terrorist groups, which are on the brink of annihilation,” he added.
