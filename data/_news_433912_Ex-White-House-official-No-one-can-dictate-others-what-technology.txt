TEHRAN - Frank Von Hippel, a former White House director assistant, has said that no country should dictate others what technologies they can or cannot have.
 “Everything should be controlled within international agreements, not a country dictates to other countries what technologies they can or cannot have,” he told IRNA in an interview published on Sunday. The U.S. has urged the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran for launching satellites. Hippel also said the Trump administration’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal came as very “serious and damaging” blow to the U.S. image in the world. President Trump unilaterally pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal in May 2018 and illegally ordered reimposition of sanctions against Iran. On January 31, France, Germany and Britain announced the creation of INSTEX, a special purpose vehicle aimed at facilitating legitimate trade between European economic operators and Iran. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said INSTEX will support legitimate European trade with Iran. Russia and China have also remained publicly committed to the existing accord. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
