TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department is “economic war room” against Iran.
 “Now, they have focused on economic and cultural war and the U.S. Treasury Department is economic war room against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the Leader said in a meeting with laborers and entrepreneurs ahead of the Labor Day. He added that economic war can be countered through reliance on domestic capabilities and capacities. “I do not believe in severing ties with the world, however, reliance on outside of the borders is absolutely wrong.” “I do not believe in severing ties with the world, however, reliance on outside of the borders is absolutely wrong,” Ayatollah Khamenei asserted. The Leader said that relations with the world should be accompanied with “vigilance”.  “We should know that the world is not just the U.S. and a number of the European countries. The world is big and we should have relations with various countries.” Ayatollah Khamenei said that supporting the Iranian manufacturers and relying on domestic capacities are the only ways to counter the economic war waged by the United States. “The government and officials are duty bound to solve problems of the entrepreneurs and workers and increase capacities of production, and the people are duty bound to determine to buy Iranian products,” he explained. Pointing to his visit to an exhibition of the Iranian products, he said, “Yesterday, an exhibition of Iranian products was held here [the Imam Khomeini Hussayniyeh]. I visited the exhibition for several hours; I saw your products. In spite of all the sanctions and problems being caused by the arrogant powers, the products were remarkable. Truly, the artistic hands of the Iranian worker must be praised. Hands must be praised for your work that I saw.”   “We should know that the world is not just the U.S. and a number of the European countries. The world is big and we should have relations with various countries.” He also said that support for local manufacturers is the “best and most efficient way” to counter the enemies’ economic plots, because they have come to realize that they will achieve nothing through armed conflict. “U.S. provoking certain ‘ignorant’ countries against Iran” The Leader also said that another way that the U.S. has taken toward Iran is provoking certain “ignorant” and “heedless” countries in the region in order to cause clashes in the region. “The U.S. makes efforts to provoke the Saudis and certain regional countries to confront the Islamic Republic. They should not be deceived by the U.S. if they are wise enough,” Ayatollah Khamenei suggested. He added, “Certain regional countries should know that they will be defeated and harmed severely if they confront the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The Leader said the conflicts gripping the region are because of the U.S. presence, suggesting that the U.S. should leave the West Asian region.
