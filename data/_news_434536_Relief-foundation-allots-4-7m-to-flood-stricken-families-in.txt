TEHRAN – Emam Khomeini Relief Foundation has allocated a total budget of 200 billion rials (nearly $4.7 million) as low-interest loans to those residing in the flood-ravaged province of Khuzestan, the Foundation’s head has said.  “Some 10,000 families under the Foundation’s coverage have been affected by flooding,” Mehr quoted Parviz Fattah as saying on Tuesday. To help financially struggling families, we ensure that flood-damaged housing units will be fully repaired and retrofitted, he highlighted. Referring to business units or facilities destroyed by floods, he noted that loans amounting to 500 million rials (about $12,000) will be granted to the flood-hit victims. Additionally, losses inflicted upon farming lands will be compensated by the Foundation and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fattah concluded.  Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation is a charitable organization, founded in March 1979, after the Islamic Revolution, to provide support for families who are struggling financially. The aim is to help such families regain financial stability. Boosting job creation is one of the primary objectives of the foundation.
