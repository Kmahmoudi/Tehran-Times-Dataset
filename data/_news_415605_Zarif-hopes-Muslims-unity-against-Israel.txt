TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Has expressed hope that the emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on the recent developments at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound would lead to Muslim unity against the Zionist regime of Israel.
 During a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Istanbul on Tuesday, Zarif said Tehran attaches great importance to the OIC emergency meeting. Upon his arrival in Istanbul, he said, “This emergency meeting, which is in fact meeting of executive committee, shows the Islamic countries’ coordination against the Zionist regime’s new move.”  Clashes erupted in the West Bank and al-Quds between the Israeli forces and the Palestinians following a deadly shooting incident there on July 14. Tensions escalated as Israel installed security equipment, including metal detectors and cameras, at the sacred compound. Two days after metal detectors were also dismantled. The main prayer session at Al-Aqsa mosque ended relatively calmly on Friday. But tensions remained high and more serious violence erupted in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. “It is essential for the Islamic and regional countries to be vigilant about policies of the Zionist regime and not let this fake regime divert the world of Islam’s attention from the main threat,” Zarif noted. The chief diplomat also faulted Israel for the spread of terrorism and extremism in the Islamic world. “The main threat to the world of Islam is the Zionist regime which has spread those threats [terrorism and extremism],” Zarif remarked.
