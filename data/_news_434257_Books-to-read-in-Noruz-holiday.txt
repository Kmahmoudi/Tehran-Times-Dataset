If you dislike wasting your time during the Noruz holiday with boring and repetitive visits to a number of distant relatives and places, perhaps a book along with several cups of tea and some sweets can provide a good time and create a cozy atmosphere for you at home. The following is a short list of some suggested books.          “1984” George Orwell’s 1949 novel “1984” is one of the books you must read before you die and what time is better than during the Noruz holiday? The dystopia depicted in “1984” is in the future but it seems very familiar nowadays. Big Brother (which can be any government around the world) puts the citizens under scrutiny; they listen to you, follow you, everyone around you could be a spy, and the world is full of hate and war. The book has been turned into movies and series, but one of the most successful ones is the 1984 adaptation by English director Michael Radford. Several Persian translations of “1984” and of Orwell’s other book “Animal Farm” have been published in Iran. The books are still very popular among Persian readers.  “Jack Reacher” If you’re looking for excitement, the “Jack Reacher” novel series is what you need. Written by James D. Grant, known by his pen name Lee Child, the series follows the stories and adventures of a former American military policeman, Jack Reacher, who travels across the U.S. The first book of the series, “Killing Floor”, won both the Anthony Award and the Barry Award for Best First Novel in 1997. The 23rd book of the series, which is the latest one, was published in 2018. Christopher McQuarrie has directed a screen adaptation of “One Shot” from the series in 2012. In addition, Edward Zwick made “Jack Reacher: Never Go Back” based on “Never Go Back” from the collection in 2016. Tom Cruise stars as Jack Reacher in both movies. Both English and Persian versions of the series can be found at Iranian bookstores. Mohammad Abbasabadi is the translator of the Persian series published by Tandis in Tehran.   “A Fraction of the Whole” The 656-page book is Australian author Steve Toltz’s debut novel. You may need a longer vacation to finish it. The 2008 book follows the story of three generations of Dean Family narrated by different characters with various points of views.  “A Fraction of the Whole” was nominated for several literary awards, including the Ned Kelly Awards for Crime Writing, the Man Booker Prize (UK) and the Miles Franklin Literary Award. It won the People’s Choice Award at New South Wales Premier’s Literary Awards in 2009. Various Persian translations are available in the Iranian book market, but a translation by Peyman Khaksar published by Cheshmeh Publications seems best.   “Oscar and the Lady in Pink”  Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, the Franco-Belgian playwright and short story writer, is a familiar name for Iranian book lovers.  Schmitt’s 2002 novella “Oscar and the Lady in Pink” has been translated into Persian by different translators.  The book is about Oscar, a ten-year-old boy who is suffering from cancer and is in a hospital. He is encouraged by Mamie Rose, one of the volunteers working at the hospital with a pink uniform, to write letters to God.  The book was turned into a movie by the author in 2009.  “I Will Turn off the Lights” It is tough to choose a Persian book as numerous popular writers and books are available at nearby libraries and bookstores. Iranian writer Zoya Pirzad’s award-winning novel “I Will Turn off the Lights” is one of the books. “I Will Turn off the Lights” is about a devoted housewife, Clarice, who lives a comfortable life with her two children and husband in the southwestern Iranian city of Abadan in the 1960s. But a chance acquaintance with a new neighbor shatters her inner peace and happiness.    The bestselling novel was translated into English by American scholar Franklin Lewis in 2012 and published by London’s Oneworld Publications under the title of “Things We Left Unsaid”.  The 99th edition of the book published by Markaz Publications is available at Iranian bookstores.  “Diary of a Wimpy Kid”  And you dear children! American cartoonist and writer Jeff Kinney’s “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” series can be your smart choice.  The series is filled with the handwritten notes by its main character, Greg Heffley, and simple drawings of his adventures.  The 13th book of the series was published in 2018 and will continue on through the 15th. Hoze Noqre Publications has released the Persian translation of the whole collection by Sara Esfandiarpur.
