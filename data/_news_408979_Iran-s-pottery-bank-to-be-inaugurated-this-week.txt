TEHRAN – University of Tehran in close collaboration with Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization will inaugurate Iran’s pottery bank this week. The bank would be a rich national source of knowledge to researchers, students, and archaeologists as it houses half a million pieces which date from 7,000 BC onwards, ISNA reported on Friday.  “Due to the fact that Iranian plateau has been one of the cradles of technology, culture, and civilization since prehistoric times, so the unearthed potteries are of importance, and some of which are absolutely unique in the world,” ISNA quoted Hassan Talaei, who presides over the Institute of Archaeology at University of Tehran, as saying. “The bank’s importance lies in the fact that its collections have been built up since 1959 from various historical sites across the country, most of which are now buried beneath modern urban expansions,” Talaei added.
