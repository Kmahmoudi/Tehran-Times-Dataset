TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani suggested on Sunday that dialogue is the only way to settle the dispute between North and South Korea.
 Rouhani made the remarks during a meeting in Tehran with Kim Yong-nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly of North Korea. The Iranian president said that Iran wants peace in the Korean peninsula. For his part, Kim called for expansion of relations with Iran in various areas. Kim also said his country attaches great importance to the Non-Aligned Movement’s role in establishing peace and security. The northern section of the Korean peninsula has been governed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, while the southern portion has been governed by the Republic of Korea since the Armistice Agreement ended the Korean War in 1953. The North and South Koreas are not at war but there are hostilities between them. NA/PA
