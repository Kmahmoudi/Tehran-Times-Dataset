TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani has been briefed on the latest environmental situation in southern Iran, recently hit by disturbing sand and dust storms for more than two weeks, IRNA reported on Tuesday. 
 Short-, medium-, and long-term water management policies, introduction of new planting patterns, soil stabilization techniques, and restoration of wetlands, were among the priorities emphasized. 
The president also agreed with the addition of six expanses in different parts of the country as new preserved zones, which allows for stricter protective measures to take force in the areas.   SP/PA
