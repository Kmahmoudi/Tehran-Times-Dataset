TEHRAN – Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani on Monday addressed an extraordinary session of the inter-parliamentary union of Islamic countries to discuss the U.S. embassy move from Tel Aviv to al-Quds, warning of the consequences of the “naive” move.

 “I advise the incumbent American officials not to miscalculate about Palesine, al-Quds, the resistance front, or the Islamic world; and not to imagine that such moves on Palestine or the Iranian nuclear issue will go without a response,” Larijani said. “All these actions reveal that the American regime suffers from a crisis over strategic decision-making, and regards the international arena naively and adventurously. I believe the incumbent American president lacks the acumen to discern and judge the long-term effects of his decisions.” The U.S. regards the international arena naively and adventurously... and its president lacks the acumen to discern and judge the long-term effects of his decisions. He added, “We not only strongly condemn the antihuman actions of the Zionist regime, but do so for the statement by the American State Department and the American president’s decision as well. We also encourage swift response by the Islamic countries and the world community.” “The Islamic countries are able to adopt practical measures such as boycotting political and economic relations with this regime, and brining the case to the International Court of Justice by referring to the UN General Assembly’s resolution to acquire the advisory opinion of the court with the hope of annulling this decision, and thereby preventing the naturalization of such dangerous trend which presents the Palestinian nation with a fait accompli.” SP/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
