TEHRAN- Tehran residents donated 70 billion Rials (about $1.6 million) to the State Welfare Organization over the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year (started March 21), said the organization’s director.  Around 40 billion Rials (about $950,000) of the donations were in goods and 30 billion rials (about $715,000) were in cash, Mohammad Rahim Fazelinejad told Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. Currently, the State Welfare Organization supports around 100,000 people including the physically challenged, patients with neurosychological disorders, children without caretakers and breadwinner women, he added. “Since the beginning of the current [Iranian calendar] year, 22,000 new people with disabilities who were on the waiting list, were registered in the organization; however, there are still 3,000 people awaiting to be supported by the organization,” he further noted. Earlier this month, the then organization’s director, Anoushirvan Mohseni Bandpey said over 50,000 job opportunities would be generated by the Organization for the individuals under the Organization’s coverage in the next Iranian calendar year (March 2019-March 2020).
