Top Lebanese Druze politician Walid Jumblatt on Saturday called on Saudi Arabia to enter dialogue with Iran.
 It is very difficult to stop the war unless issues are overcome and discussions are held with Iranians, Reuters quoted Jumblatt as saying. “Enough of the destruction and siege in Yemen and enough of the human and material drain on the Kingdom’s people and resources,” he said. Jumblatt said, “The challenges are tremendous and the modernization of the Kingdom is an Islamic and Arabic necessity but this mission cannot be successful while the Yemen war continues.” Saudi Arabia’s military campaign has launched military campaign against Yemen since 2015 with the aim of eliminating the Yemeni Houthi Ansarullah movement and reinstalling Yemen’s former President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who has close ties with the Saudis.  Failing to achieve either of its goals, Riyadh has not stopped bombing Yemeni targets, creating a protracted conflict which led to the killings of over 12,000 Yemenis and the destruction of the poor country’s infrastructure. The aggression is also accompanied by a Saudi-led naval and aerial blockade. On Wednesday, the coalition said it would allow aid in through the Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Salif, as well as UN flights to Sanaa.
