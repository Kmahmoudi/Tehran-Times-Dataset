The presidents of Iran, Russia and Turkey started talks on the Syrian conflict in Ankara on Wednesday.
 The summit, hosted by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is a follow-up to the previous summit by the leaders of the three countries on November 22 in Sochi, Russia. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran flew to Ankara for the summit on Tuesday. Prior to his travel, Rouhani insisted on Tehranâ€™s long-held policy that there is no military solution to the eight-year Syrian civil war. Russian President Vladimir Putin also arrived in Ankara for the trilateral summit on Tuesday. Iran, Russia and Turkey, as the main power brokers in Syria, have arranged several rounds of talks between the Syrian government and opposition in Astana, Kazakhstan, so far. Iran and Russia have been backing the Syrian government while Turkey have been supporting the opposition. However, the three countries agree in principle that all sides should have a share in running the country.
