TEHRAN- Iran’s Persian Gulf Star Refinery (PGSR)’s daily gasoline output will reach 40 million liters by the end of current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019) once the third phase of the refinery is complete, according to Soroush Ziglari, the operation director of the refinery. Last December, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said: “Iran will reach a stable status in gasoline production once the second phase of Persian Gulf Star Refinery comes on stream.” The second phase of the refinery (in south of Iran), was inaugurated by President Hassan Rouhani in late June, and on July 28, Mohammad-Ali Dadvar, the managing director of refinery, announced that its daily gasoline production has increased 2 million liters to stand at 26 million liters. The refinery in the southern province of Hormozgan is the first of its kind designed based on gas condensate feedstock. Some 240,000 barrels of gas condensate are being transferred per day from South Pars Gas Field, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, to Persian Gulf Star Refinery. The transferring pipeline has the daily capacity of 800,000 barrels.   MA/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
