TEHRAN – Iran's Ambassador to London, Hamid Baeidinejad, on Friday rejected the U.S. government’s claim that Iran had supplied Yemeni Houthi fighters with missiles, saying the U.S. itself is directly involved in the massacre of Yemeni people.
 In a statement, Baeidinejad said the claim, made by U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, was baseless and lacked supporting evidence, describing it as part of Washington’s anti-Iran propaganda, IRNA reported. He also said Saudi Arabia had used American weapons to wage the Yemen war, which has killed thousands of Yemeni civilians, including women and children. MH/PA
