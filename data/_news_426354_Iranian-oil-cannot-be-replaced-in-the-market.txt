TEHRAN - Iran's former OPEC Governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi said Iran’s oil customers won’t find a suitable alternative for Iranian oil, IRIB reported on Friday. The official noted that the oil producing countries like Kuwait, Russia and UAE don’t have enough surplus capacity to replace Iranian oil in the market. According to the official, Iran is currently shipping over 2.8 million barrels per day of oil and gas condensate to the world markets. “The market is also skeptical about the mentioned countries being able to supply the expected oil demands which is why many consumer countries are negotiating with the United States for waivers because they know they will not find suitable alternatives for Iranian crude” he added.
