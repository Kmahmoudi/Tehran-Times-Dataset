During the meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei congratulated all Muslims in the world on the occasion of Unity Week. The Leader mentioned the significance that Prophet Mohammad (S) attached to the fate of the Islamic Ummah and underlined that the Islamic world has now reached a decisive point in its history. If, at this juncture, the political, cultural, and scientific elites of the Islamic world fulfill their duty to help Islamic nations choose the correct path to unity and resistance to the oppressor powers, the Muslims will progress and prosper; otherwise, they will remain decades away from prosperity, he observed. Underlining the fact that Muslims should value their honorable history and heritage and avoid differences, Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the scholars of the Islamic world should cast aside selfishness and materialism and should feel responsible for promoting the unity and convergence of all Muslims in the world, he said. The West has made serious efforts to disrupt the current weak unity among Muslims, and the situation in Iraq and other parts of the Islamic world is proof of this, he added. Elsewhere in his remarks, the Leader said, “If Muslim countries were united, the Palestinian nation and its elected government would not be left alone, threatened, or pressured; those who are responsible for the current suffering of the Palestinian nation would not speak so demandingly; and finally, the Europeans, the self-proclaimed standard-bearers of human rights, would not just observe the atrocities currently being committed against the Palestinian nation without taking any action.” The Islamic world should unite to defend the Palestinian nation and government, he added. Ayatollah Khamenei also called Prophet Mohammad (S) the focal point for convergence, unity, and love among Muslims. Yet, the fact that mercenary pro-Zionist authors insult this epicenter of the Islamic world is another reason why the political, cultural, and scientific elites should rely on this epicenter and should promote convergence and unity among Muslims, he added.
