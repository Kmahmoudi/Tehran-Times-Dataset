TEHRAN – A member of the Expediency Council has said Iran does not trust “anyone” when it comes to international relations, suggesting that in order to go forward with the nuclear deal, the country needs assurances from the other sides. In an interview with Jame Jam newspaper published on Tuesday, Mohammad Sadr said the nuclear agreement once secured Iran’s national interests “but suddenly a person like Trump [emerged] and ignored all commitments.” He added that the United States, by pulling out of the international agreement and ignoring all related commitments, has “insulted” the Europeans.
