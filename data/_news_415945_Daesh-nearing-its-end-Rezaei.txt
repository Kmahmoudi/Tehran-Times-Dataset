TEHRAN - Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezaei said on Monday that Daesh (Islamic State) is approaching its end, yet committing brutal acts to pretend the otherwise. 
 Liberation of Mosul and Aleppo indicates the imminent annihilation of Daesh, he said during a ceremony held to commemorate martyr Mohsen Hojaji.  
Hojaji, a member of the Iranian advisory support team in Syria, was captured by Daesh terrorists on August 7 near the Tanf border crossing in southeast Syria, and was beheaded afterward. NA/PA
