TEHRAN — Tehran will hopefully dispatch 80,000 pilgrims to Hajj in 2017, the Supreme Leader’s representative in Hajj affairs said on Sunday, Tasnim reported.

 Except for some minor issues which are yet to be settled, Tehran and Riyadh have almost agreed on resuming Hajj, Ali Qazi Askar stated. He further said the Saudi Arabian airport workers have been sentenced to four years in prison each, 1000 lashes, and dismissed for sexually harassing an Iranian minor in 2015.
