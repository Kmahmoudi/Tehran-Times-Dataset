TEHRAN – The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced that it will continue its cooperation with the Central Bank of Iran and its governor Valiollah Seif after the United States slapped sanctions on him.
 The IMF further said as Iran is one of its members, it will continue to cooperate with Seif, IRNA reported. Last week, the U.S. Treasury accused Seif of covertly funneling money on behalf of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) and imposed sanctions on him. Speaking in Brussels, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called the sanctions against Seif “illegal”.
