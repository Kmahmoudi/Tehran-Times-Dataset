TEHRAN – European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has expressed doubt that she would be able to attend an anti-Iran summit scheduled to be held in Warsaw next month. “I guess I am traveling to the African Union Summit during those days and then, around that summit that is going to be held in Addis Ababa that was planned obviously long ago, I am going to have some other visits in the Horn of Africa so I am afraid I am not in Brussels that day or in Europe those days,” Mogherini told reporters in Brussels on Monday.
