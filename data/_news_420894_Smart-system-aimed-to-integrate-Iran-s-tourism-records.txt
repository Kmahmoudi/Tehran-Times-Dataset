TEHRAN – Iran’s tourism body has recently unveiled a smart management network that makes it easy for integrating and monitoring all nationwide data on travel and hospitality sectors. Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization Deputy Director Mohammad Moheb-Khodaei said on Monday that the centralized network, which is in the reach of everyone, provides useful information for managers, investors, the academia and other travel associates. It simplifies centralized supervision on tourism affairs, yet helps to appropriately develop new plans and strategies, he explained. Moheb-Khodaei added, “The integration of all arrangements will help avoid redundancy.” “By the means of that system, we are able to control provincial departments and their satellite offices. Clienteles won’t be waiting behind the doors, yet can directly submit their requests.” People can easily learn about potentials and opportunities [of each region], meanwhile it registers their comments, complaints and suggestions, Moheb-Khodaei stated. The official added the system provides fresh and year-on-year data on health and medical tourism, ecotourism, pilgrimage, historic and cultural travels and sports tourism. Filled from corner to corner with ancient bazaars, museums, mosques, monuments, gardens, historical sites, rich natural and rural landscapes, Iran hosts some of the world’s oldest cultural monuments, including 22 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
