TEHRAN â€“ Iran will host the final evaluation ceremony of the World Crafts Council (WCC) Award of Excellence for Handicrafts in early August, Mehr reported. Handicrafts made by artisans from Kuwait, Oman, Jordan, Lebanon, Bahrain, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and Iran will be vying for the awards in the West Asia Sub-Region division, the report said. The World Crafts Council Award of Excellence for Handicrafts made its debut in Jakarta in April 2014. The awards aim to ensure that when consumers buy awarded handicrafts, they are buying high quality, culturally-authentic products that have been manufactured in a socially-responsible manner with respect for the environment. Dozens of Iranian handicrafts have gained the UNESCO Seal of Excellence during the past couple of years.
