TEHRAN – Head coach of Iran national football team Carlos Queiroz says the name of FIFA must be changed to the United Nations of Football since the sport brings the whole world together.  “FIFA has predicted a global audience of 400 million to watch the game live on television. It means our matches against Morocco, Spain and Portugal will be watched by an estimated 1.2 billion people in the world,” Queiroz said. “Scoring just a goal in the competition will make all Iranian people happy and it will have a big impact on their life,” the Portuguese added. “A third of the world's population – 2.5 billion people – watched the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and I hope that the spectators will increase in the 2018 World Cup,” the former Real Madrid coach said. “Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) must change its name to United Nations of Football because the people around the world will come together in June for football,” Queiroz concluded. Carlos Queiroz’s team have been drawn in Group B of the 2018 World Cup along with Morocco,  Spain, and Portugal. The Iran national football team will open the campaign with a match against Morocco at Saint Petersburg on June 15. Team Melli, meanwhile, face Spain in Kazan on 20 June before meeting Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in Saransk five days later.
