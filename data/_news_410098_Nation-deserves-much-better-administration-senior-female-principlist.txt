TEHRAN – The spokeswoman of the principlist Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces (PFIRF) said on Sunday that the nation deserves a much better government than the Rouhani administration, IRNA reported. “One cannot see [enough] efforts for solving people’s problems,” said Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi, emphasizing that the popular front is determined to change the current situation. The former health minister added that the front seeks to cooperate with “anyone who cares about the Revolution and the country.” Vahid-Dastjerdi also said that the front will hold a meeting on January 26, with thousands attending from across the country. Coming into existence in late December, the group has pledged to become the main rival to President Hassan Rouhani in the May presidential election.  It intends to unite the principlist camp in order to introduce a single candidate to challenge Rouhani who will most likely seek a second term. The popular front is headed by Hojatoleslam Mohammad Hossein Rahimian. The members of the front are Yahya Ale Es’haq, Mehdi Chamran, Hamid-Reza Haji Babaee, Reza Roosta Azad, Mahmoud Khosravi Vafa, Mehdi Mohammadi, Ali Reza Marandi, Nader Talebzadeh and Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi. Iran will hold its next presidential and city council elections on May 19. MH/PA
