TEHRAN- Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (also known as RAI) will hold a conference on investment making opportunities in the railway projects on November 12, a deputy at RAI announced. Nourollah Beyranvand, the deputy head of RAI for planning and investment, said, “Many railway projects have not achieved their goals due to lack of fund; so we are seeking to plan a fruitful process for an active and effective cooperation in the field of investment making”, IRIB reported. RAI’s approach is achieving the highest level of private sector’s presence in the railway projects, the official underlined. Last month, Managing Director of RAI Saeed Mohammadzadeh announced that transporting loads via railway can save up to $600 million in comparison with road transportation, adding that domestic rail network is ready to add 30 billion tons of goods to its present capacity.
