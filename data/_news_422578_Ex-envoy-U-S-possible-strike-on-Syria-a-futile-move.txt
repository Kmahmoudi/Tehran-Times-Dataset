TEHRAN – A former Iranian ambassador to Syria has slammed Trump’s rhetoric of military action against Syria as an attempt to make up for Washington’s failures, saying an American attack on Syria would be practically ineffective. In an interview with Tasnim, Hossein Sheikholeslam said Washington’s response to the alleged use of chemical weapons is another instance of its attempts to play a role in Syria. The U.S. is trying to make up for its failure to overthrow the Damascus government or disintegrate Syria, and compensate for its failed plans in Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta, he added.
