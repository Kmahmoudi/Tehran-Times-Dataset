TEHRAN â€” President Hassan Rouhani has declared the wetlands restoration law, passed by the Majlis (the Iranian parliament) on April 19, the Department of Environment official website reported on Sunday.  Majlis had passed the general outlines of the wetlands restoration bill which was proposed by the Department of Environment earlier in May 2015. The bill puts a great emphasis on restoration and protection of the wetlands that are of great ecological values by tasking the Department of Environment to do so. Any illegal exploitation or acts resulting in the wetlands degradation are illicit and the Department of Environment is in charge of determining the harms and pollution sources.
