TEHRAN – Morteza Salimi, director of the Relief and Rescue Organization of the Iranian Red Crescent Society, said on Saturday that Iran’s first humanitarian aid consignment for Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims has been sent to Bangladesh, Mehr news agency reported.  
 Salimi said since Myanmar is refusing to cooperate, the 40-ton shipment was delivered to Bangladesh on Friday. “The aid was sent to Bangladesh with the collaboration of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iran’s Air Force,” he added.
