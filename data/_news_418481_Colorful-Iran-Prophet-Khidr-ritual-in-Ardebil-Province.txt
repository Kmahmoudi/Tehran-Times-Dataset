People in northwestern Ardebil Province traditionally commemorate Prophet Khidr during a ritual on a Friday in mid-winter.

 For people in Ardebil, the winter is composed of two forty days, known as chelleh, which begins on December 20. The ritual takes place on a Friday between these two chellehs. During the event, women provide a food known as Qavut, which is composed of ground wheat and some roasted beans. They put Qavut, a bowl of water and some fruits in a tray in a room during the night and they believe that Prophet Khidr drinks the water and eats the food and it becomes sacred and in the morning, they eat them. As said in Surah Al-Kahf in the Holy Quran, Prophet Khidr drank the water of life and became immortal.
