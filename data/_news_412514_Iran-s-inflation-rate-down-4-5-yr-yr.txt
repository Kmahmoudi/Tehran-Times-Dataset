TEHRAN- The Statistical Center of Iran put the country’s inflation rate at 9.8 percent in the past Iranian calendar year 1395 (ended on March 20), showing 4.5 percent drop from its preceding year. It is while Central Bank of Iran (CBI) had previously put the country’s inflation rate at nine percent during the past calendar year.
Iran, accordingly, could manage to experience a single-digit inflation rate after 26 years in 1395.
Inflation rate in the last month of the past calendar year, Esfand (February 19- March 20), stood at 11.9 percent, according to CBI.
On June 14, 2016, Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Ali Tayyebnia said the country planned to reduce the inflation rate to a single digit by the coming two months.
The goal was achieved in the third Iranian calendar month of Khordad (ended on June 20, 2016) when the inflation rate hit 9.5 percent.
Curbing inflation was one of the major promises by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during his presidential campaign. Under the previous administration, inflation skyrocketed to cross 44%.  MA
