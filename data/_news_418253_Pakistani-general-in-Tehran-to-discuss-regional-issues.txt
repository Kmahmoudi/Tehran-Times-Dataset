TEHRAN – Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, arrived in Tehran on Sunday while accompanied by a high-profile military delegation.
 The general’s visit to Iran came after an invitation by Major General Mohammad Baqeri, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces. The two top generals are slated to hold talks about regional issues and border security. Days ago, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry released a statement saying Tehran and Islamabad will hold a meeting to find a solution for Afghanistan’s conflict and exchange views about border security.
