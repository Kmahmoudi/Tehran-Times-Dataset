TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Tuesday that the U.S. animosity towards Iran and China is “strategic” and “deep”.
 “The U.S. animosity towards Iran and China is not tactical, rather it is strategic and deep,” Larijani said during a meeting with Song Tao the head of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China. Larijani proposed that “a strategic thinking should be followed to counter” this animosity. Larijani also said, “Consultations between Iran, China and cooperation of certain friendly countries can help counter the U.S. animosity and neutralize its consequences. However, success of this plan is contingent upon practical steps.” Elsewhere, he called for expansion of relations.
