Although the Western media have often insulted Islamic sanctities -- an obvious example is the book “The Satanic Verses” by Salman Rushdie – these publications’ recent insults of the prophet of Islam are a new development that had not occurred before. The simultaneous measures definitely were not an accident. Rather, they are part of a comprehensive plan to confront Islam. A careful analysis of similar events around the world over the past five years reveals that the U.S. neoconservatives and the Zionist lobby have formulated a plot to influence public opinion in the West so as to foster animosity between Islam and Christianity. After 9/11, the Western mass media, and particularly the media outlets controlled by the Zionists, launched a massive disinformation campaign meant to tarnish the image of Islam. The propaganda assault was intensified after the bombings in London and Madrid, and Muslims living in the Western world came under great pressure. In addition, mosques in the United States and Europe were physically attacked. Unfortunately, the propaganda campaign inspired certain Christian fundamentalist groups to launch an ideological offensive against Islam, which led to a general rise in Islamophobia in the West. These measures significantly hindered Muslims’ efforts to promote inter-faith dialogue with Christians because the leaders of Islamic countries concluded that Christians constantly bombarded by Zionist propaganda would not be interested in establishing a logical relationship with the Islamic world. However, the affinities between Islam and Christianity will eventually undermine the efforts of the Zionist fanatics who are trying to sow discord between followers of the two religions. Behind the plot to foster animosity between Muslims and Christians, we should look for the hand of the Zionists, especially in the endeavors to influence the media in Scandinavia. It is true that Islam and Christianity have different outlooks, but they have no differences concerning the message of the prophets, who came to save humanity from corruption and ignorance. Today, as the Western world is experiencing a wave of terrorism, Muslim nations are suffering due to the deviant thoughts of reactionary groups that do not have a true understanding of Islam and are trying to impose their views on others. Meanwhile, in the case of the blasphemous caricatures, if the offending countries do not apologize to the world’s 1.5 billion Muslims soon, a dangerous rift could arise between the West and the East, with the repercussions being greater for the West. The economies of Western countries are largely based on exports. If Muslims decided to boycott Western products, it would surely cause a devastating economic crisis in the West.
