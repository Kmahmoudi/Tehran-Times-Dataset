TEHRAN- Gasoline production in Iran will be increased by 12 million liters to hit 100 million liters per day within the next three months, according to the chairman of the Association of Iranian Refining Companies. The country can achieve self-reliance in gasoline production once its daily output is over 90 million liters, Nasser Ashouri told IRIB. As National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (NIOPDC) Managing Director Alireza Sadeqabadi has previously announced, daily production of gasoline in the country has increased by 18 million liters during the first quarter of current Iranian calendar year (March 21-June 21) compared to the same period of time in the past year. In mid-December last year, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said: “Iran will reach a stable status in gasoline production once the second phase of Persian Gulf Star Refinery comes on stream.” The second phase of the refinery (in south of Iran), was inaugurated by President Hassan Rouhani in late June, and on July 28, Mohammad-Ali Dadvar, the managing director of refinery, announced that its daily gasoline production has increased 2 million liters to stand at 26 million liters. The refinery in the southern province of Hormozgan is the first of its kind designed based on gas condensate feedstock.
