TEHRAN – Iran’s Supreme Court has upheld death sentences against eight members of the Daesh (ISIL) group on charges of having a role in the June 2017 terrorist attacks in Tehran, a judge confirmed on Monday. Speaking to Tasnim, Tehran Revolution Court chief Mousa Ghazanfarabadi said the Supreme Court has ruled that capital punishment is commensurate with their conviction for “aiding and abetting” violent action against the Islamic Republic. On June 7, 2017, Daesh terrorists launched simultaneous attacks on Iran’s Parliament building and the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini in southern Tehran.
