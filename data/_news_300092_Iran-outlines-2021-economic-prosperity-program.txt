Iran outlined its program for achieving economic prosperity envisaged by the Sixth Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan, which ends in 2021. In a conference on Tuesday, Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Ali Tayyebnia said, “We should lay the ground in the country to achieve economic growth,” according to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). The minister mentioned achieving an economic growth of eight percent as one of the main objectives of the sixth development plan. Referring to the significant role of productivity, the official said productivity is planned to account for one third of Iran’s economic growth in the sixth development plan. While lifting of sanctions creates many opportunities for the country’s economic growth, there are still economic challenges in Iran that should come under special attention, Tayyebnia noted. Iran’s economy was hurt by reduced foreign currency incomes during the sanctions, the minister stated, adding that to tackle this harm and also the effect of reduced oil revenues, Iran prepared a stimulus package and outlined some plans in line with the country’s “Resistance Economy”. He also mentioned creation of stable jobs, curbing unemployment and promoting public contribution as some main strategic objectives of the sixth plan. Addressing the same gathering, Central Bank Governor Valiollah Seif said growth of production in the country is the main priority of the sixth plan. He mentioned boosting of production, exports and job creation as the main policy of the country’s banking system in the sixth plan. Iran is forecast to reach an economic growth of 5 percent in the next Iranian calendar year (which will start on March 20, 2016), the official further announced. For his part, Iran’s Management and Planning Organization Director Mohammad-Baqer Nobakht said the sixth plan has envisaged the creation of 900,000 jobs per year. He said proper investment should be made to achieve this objective. The country’s unemployment rate is planned to stand at seven percent by the end of the sixth plan, the official announced.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
