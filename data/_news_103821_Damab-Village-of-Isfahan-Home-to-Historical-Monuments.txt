The historical edifice of Damab is the largest one in the region constructed at the behest of Haj Hassan Damabi in Qajar era. Along with other castles in the region, this castle functioned as a fortress against the attacks of Lor regional tribes. Having 5 towers, the sturdy castle has a 4m-thick foundation. In the years of invasion, the brigands of the time once tried to break in the castle to take the grains but faced defeat due to the durability of the castle. Located 13km off Damab Village, Jelogir Caravansary was constructed during the reign of Shah Abbas dynasty. It is a solid structure made of bricks. Although, presently, it is far from the main road, it was along the path of big commercial caravans, that time.   There are a few other historical monuments in the region including Ali-Mohammad Castle, Damab Hosseinieh (place for seasonal religious ceremonies) and Stone Castle which date back to pre-Islamic era.
