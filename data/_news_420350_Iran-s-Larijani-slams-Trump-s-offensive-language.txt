TEHRAN – Iran’s Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani on Monday slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s “humiliating” and “offensive” language against other countries.
 During a meeting with U.S. senators on Thursday, Trump used an insulting language to describe Haiti, El Salvador and unspecified African countries, calling them “shitholes”. “Such remarks were offensive and humiliating which lead us to ‘modern brutality’. The political language is not working in normal mode anymore and humiliating language is being used instead of respecting nations,” Larijani said during a speech to the Parliamentary Union of OIC Member States. The top lawmaker noted that such remarks by Trump are “provocative”. “We, as Islamic countries, should denounce such behaviors. No president should humiliate other nations be it African or non-African,” Larijani added. Larijani said that such a language does not help cooperation among the countries and deepen division and animosities. U.S. diplomats around the world were summoned for formal reproach, amid global shock that such crude remarks could ever be made in a semi-public meeting by the president of America, the Guardian reported. The 55-nation African Union said the remarks were “clearly racist”. ‘World should hear Palestinians’ voice’ Larijani also said the Parliamentary Union of the Islamic countries is “voice of the Islamic community” and should invite the world to hear the Palestinians’ voice. He also attached great importance to expansion of economic cooperation among the Islamic countries. The Muslim countries have many resources to use in line with expanding cooperation, the parliament speaker remarked.
