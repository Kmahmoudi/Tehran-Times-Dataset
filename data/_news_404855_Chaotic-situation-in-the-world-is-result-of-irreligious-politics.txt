TEHRAN – The custodian of the Astan Quds Razavi has said the chaotic and deplorable security situation in the world is the result of departure from the divine religions by the West.

 “The first and second world wars, seventy-year of oppression by the usurper Zionist regime against the defenseless people of Palestine and the current deplorable state of the world are the results of more than 300 years of struggle with the divine values and the West’s irreligious politics,” Ebrahim Raeisi said on Monday, Astan News reported.
