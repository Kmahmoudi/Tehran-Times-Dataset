TEHRAN- Iran’s Pars Especial Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) exported $3.598 billion of gas condensate in the first five months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-August 21), showing a 76-percent growth compared to the same time last year,” according to Ahmad Pour-Heydar, the director general of the customs department of the PSEEZ. The official put the weight of gas condensate exported from the zone at 8.706 million tons in the five-month period, which shows 114 percent rise compared to the first five months of the previous year, IRNA reported on Sunday. PSEEZ is located in the port city of Assaluyeh, southwestern Bushehr Province. The petrochemical complexes in the zone receive gas and gas condensate feedstock from South Pars gas field, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf. The giant gas field is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate.
