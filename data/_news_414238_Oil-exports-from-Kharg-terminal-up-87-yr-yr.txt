TEHRAN - Iran exported 240 million barrels of light crude oil from Kharg Island terminal in south part of the country during the last Iranian calendar year 1395 (ended on March 20), which indicates an 87 percent rise compared to the preceding year (1394). Due to its close distance to oilfield regions, its good offshore position and suitable depth for gigantic oil vessels berthing, Kharg Island Oil Terminal has been recognized as one of the countryâ€™s most suitable places for crude oil export and loading sites.
