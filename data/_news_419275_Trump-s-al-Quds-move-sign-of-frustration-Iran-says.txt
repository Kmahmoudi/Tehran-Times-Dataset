TEHRAN - Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Tuesday that Donald Trump’s recognition of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel shows frustration of the U.S. in the Middle East.
 “The U.S. decision in relocating Israel’s embassy to the noble Quds is an irresponsible policy which will lead to the strengthening of the Zionist regime of Israel’s occupational approach,” Hatami said in a phone conversation with Turkish Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli. Hatami added that the U.S. took such an act because of division among Muslims and certain Arab countries’ compromise with Israel. Trump declared on December 6 that he recognizes al-Quds as the capital of Israel and ordered the relocation of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds. Elsewhere, Hatami said that Iran welcomes expansion of cooperation with Turkey in defense area. For his part, Canikli said that recent developments in the region have made it essential for Iran and Turkey to expand cooperation. Canikli added no country can influence Iran-Turkey relations negatively. He also accepted Hatami’s invitation to visit Iran. The Turkish defense chief also said recognition of al-Quds as capital of Israel is a “big mistake” which is unacceptable to Muslims.
