TEHRAN – While insisting that it is crucially important to fight terrorism President Hassan Rouhani of Iran asserted on Monday that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam.
 Rouhani called Islamic a religion of mercy which opposes violence. “Terrorism is a big problem in the world and the terrorists have nothing to do with Islam, because Islam is religion of kindness and peace and opposes creating fear, insecurity and murder of the people,” Rouhani said during a meeting with Côte d’Ivoire’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Albert Toikeusse Mabri in Tehran. Highlighting the necessity of fighting cultural and economic roots of terrorism, Rouhani added that Iran spares no effort in helping countries to counter terrorism. Foreign Minister Toikeusse Mabri also said his country is seeking cooperation with Iran in fighting terrorism. ‘Expanding ties with Africans is a priority' Rouhani also said that expansion of ties with the African countries is one of Iran’s foreign policy’s principles and that Tehran is ready to deepen relations with Côte d’Ivoire in various areas, especially economy. Iran and Côte d’Ivoire have many capacities to expand cooperation and steps should be taken to identify these capacities, the president remarked. For example, he said, Iran is ready to help Côte d’Ivoire in building power plants, roads and dams. Foreign Minister Toikeusse Mabri also said that Côte d’Ivoire is determined to expand ties with Iran in various spheres. During a separate meeting with the African official, Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said that Iran seeks to expand relations with the African countries. “There has always been good relations between the two countries especially parliamentary ties and Iran’s parliament supports expansion of ties by forming parliamentary friendship group,” he said. Mabri also said his country attaches great importance to Iran’s status in the world. He also said that terrorism impedes the countries’ progress, adding collective effort is needed to fight terrorism. NA/PA
