TEHRAN- An expert on West Asia affairs believes that London-based Iran International receives at least $50 million from Saudi Arabia in a bid to disseminate bogus allegations about Iran.      Speaking to IRNA, Hassan Hanizadeh touched upon some remarks about the media war, highlighting that it is a perilous and low-cost phenomenon that has chimed in the international interactions since the past decade from the nefarious triangle of the United States, the Zionist regime, and Saudi Arabia.  “The West front, especially U.S., has laid the ground for setting up a kind of NATO in the realm of media in the wake of a litany of resounding failures in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria,” he opined. Hanizadeh went on to highlight that the Zionist and Saudi business moguls have played pivotal roles in fueling the flame of such a soft war.     He also stated that the Zionists have realized the significance of soft war over the last few decades, as in the United States alone, more than 5,000 media have come into existence to orchestrate ploys against anti-Zionist countries. The expert continued that albeit the source of their income is not known but the Jewish Agency in France receives more than $20 billion annually to foster the ideology of the Israeli regime in the world.  “The Saudi officials have purchased partial shares of influential satellites over the last two decades in an attempt to advance the kingdom’s destructive goals against certain countries,” he pointed out.  Hanizadeh stated that it is believed the financial turnover of Saudi Arabia in the sphere of media reaches $10 billion per year, which is the highest in the world. He mentioned that in confrontation with Iran as well as the axis of resistance, Saudi Arabia has garnered a cabal of advisers to launch media outlets aiming to undercutting Iran's upper hand in the region and the world.  The analyst also outlined that the Saudi-financed Iran International has grabbed more than $50 million annually to become attuned to the country’s policy towards Iran and the resistance front.      He added that more than 230 individuals are active as permanent staff and specialized experts with 40 offices around the world to make a concerted effort to make spurious and specious allegations on Iran.   The expert said bluntly that Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence agency and the former Saudi ambassador in Washington, is at the vanguard of Iran International in cahoots with Abdulrahman Al-Rashed, best known for his anti-Iranian personality.  Hanizadeh concluded that in recent weeks, this devilish network along with other Western and America media, has been responsible for whipping up riots and insurgency in Iran by providing footage how to make Molotov cocktail and ransack the Iranian public properties.
