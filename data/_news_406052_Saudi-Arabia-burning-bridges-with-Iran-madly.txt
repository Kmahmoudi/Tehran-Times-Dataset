TEHRAN - Mohsen Rezaee, secretary of the Expediency Council, has said that Saudi Arabia is “burning the bridges” with Iran in a crazy way.
 “Our relations with Saudi Arabia is deteriorating day by day and they want to burn the bridges. They are burning the bridges madly,” he tweeted on Saturday. Rezaee said on Friday that Ahmed Shaheed, the special UN rapporteur on human rights in Iran, has embedded his latest report on the human rights situation in Iran with a pack of “lies” to present it to the European Parliament in days.
