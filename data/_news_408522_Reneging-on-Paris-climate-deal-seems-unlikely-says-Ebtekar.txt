TEHRAN — Reneging on Paris climate deal seems unlikely, Iran’s chief of Department of Environment (DOE) Masoumeh Ebtekar said on Tuesday, IRNA news agency reported. Asked about possible violation of the climate agreement by the U.S. president-elect Donald Trump who has called climate change a “hoax” and just a “very, very expensive form of tax”, Ebtekar rendered the claims unlikely as the deal is an international agreement which involves many parties who are determined to save the planet. She further noted that Iran has also approved the deal and will ratify it in the near future. According to The Guardian to the world surprise Trump who had earlier announced that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive” has wavered on his previously stated position and said he has an “open mind” over U.S. involvement in the Paris agreement to combat climate change. Asked by the New York Times whether he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, which has been signed by 196 nations, Trump said: “I’m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.” In Trump’s recent pronouncements on his first 100 days in power he has pledged to cancel money for climate change programs and lift restrictions upon fossil fuel exploration on public land, but made no mention of quitting the Paris deal. The Paris Agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015 at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris from November 30 to December 13, 2015. The agreement was scheduled to enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55 percent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the depositary. So far of 197 parties to the convention 113 Parties have ratified the deal.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
