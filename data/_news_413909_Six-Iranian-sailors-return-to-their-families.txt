TEHRAN – After three months of wandering in the Indian Ocean, the six Iranian sailors were finally returned home, ISNA news agency reported. The sailors were on water for three months after their fishing boat had sunk. They were rescued by the Kenyan Coast Guard. They entered Iran on Tuesday morning thanks to efforts made by the Iranian embassy to Nairobi. The sailors were not fined for entering the Kenyan territorial waters and were handed to Iran’s embassy in the African country.
