TEHRAN – While a total budget of 330 billion rials (nearly $8 million) has been allocated to prevent addiction, the country is still short of budget in this regard, deputy head of anti-narcotics taskforce has said. “People's participation in preventing addiction is of great importance, however, not many philanthropists make donations for drug addiction prevention,” IRNA quoted Aref Vahabzadeh as saying on Sunday. Pointing out that parenting plays a significant role in preventing the children from being addicted or drug use, he added that parenting training packages are domestically prepared and provided to the families across the country.“Some 330 billion rials (nearly $8 million) has been earmarked for drug addiction prevention programs, but a greater budget is required to address the issue,” he concluded.
