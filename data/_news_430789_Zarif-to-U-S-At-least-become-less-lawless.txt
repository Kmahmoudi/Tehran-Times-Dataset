TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said asking the United States to become lawful is like asking them for the impossible, but rather Iran asks the U.S. to become “less lawless”. Zarif on Monday tweeted part of his remarks at the Doha Forum policy conference in Qatar. On the prospects of talks with the U.S., the foreign minister said, “We will not talk to anybody who sets out 12 conditions for us to talk to them after having violated a Security Council resolution that they sponsored themselves.” He added, “If anybody is to meet conditions, they are the ones who are supposed to meet conditions by becoming less lawless. I’m not asking them to be lawful, because that’s asking them for the impossible. At least become less lawless.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
