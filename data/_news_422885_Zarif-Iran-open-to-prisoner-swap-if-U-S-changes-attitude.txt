In an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan aired on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said American “demands” to release of U.S. citizens held in Tehran without changing attitude are hampering “genuine dialogue.”

 “The United States needs to approach this from a position of dealing with another sovereign government,” said Zarif. “And if that approach led to change, then the United States would see a difference.” Five Americans are known to have been detained by Iranian authorities, including the arrest of Baquer Namazi, who is reportedly ill. Some argue the detention of American-Iranian dual nationals is little more than an attempt by the far right to create leverage.  Asked about the conditions of the imprisoned Americans, Zarif insisted that their health requirements were being “taken care of.” “Our judiciary is an independent organ,” Zarif told Brennan.  “Just what you would say about your courts, and we cannot have an impact on the decisions of our judiciary. But we have been trying to use our influence from a humanitarian perspective. First of all, in order to make sure their health requirements are taken care of as well as to see whether a humanitarian agreement can be reached.” Zarif said Pompeo’s Capitol Hill testimony that Iran was not “racing towards a bomb” was a “late admission but better than never.” Some family members of the detained have pleaded the Trump administration to engage the Iranian government directly in securing their release. In 2016, Iran released four Americans in a swap for seven Iranians held in the United States. At the time, many Republicans condemned the exchange negotiated by the Obama administration. After a fiery speech by President Trump at the United Nations, where he called Iran a “murderous regime” that needed to free Americans “unjustly detained,” the Iranians declined an offered conversation between the president and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. “You do not engage in negotiations by exercising disrespect for a country, for its people, for its government, by openly making claims including this illusion about regime change. Then you do not leave much room for a genuine dialogue,” said Zarif. Pressed by Brennan on whether the Iranians were open to an exchange, like the Obama-era swap, Zarif offered an opening. “It is a possibility, certainly from a humanitarian perspective, but it requires a change in attitude,” said Zarif. Zarif says has to “wait and see” if he can work with Pompeo Elsewhere in the interview, Zarif said Mike Pompeo’s nomination and possible confirmation to be the next U.S. Secretary of State is an indication to the international community that the U.S. is “not serious” about international obligations, including holding up the Iran nuclear deal. “They put sanctions on Iran at that time because we were not racing for a bomb and now they want to reimpose sanctions on Iran because we are not racing for a bomb, it’s interesting,” Zarif added. Asked if he would be able to work with the new secretary if Pompeo is confirmed, Zarif said he would have to “wait and see.” “The requirement for any international engagement is mutual respect,” Zarif said. He added, “The indications that we have seen up until now -- not been very encouraging. We will have to wait to make a judgment on the new secretary of state.”   Zarif said Pompeo’s Capitol Hill testimony that Iran was not “racing towards a bomb” was a “late admission but better than never.” “They put sanctions on Iran at that time because we were not racing for a bomb and now they want to reimpose sanctions on Iran because we are not racing for a bomb, it’s interesting,” Zarif added. While Pompeo wouldn’t explicitly say whether he will advocate to stay in -- or pull out of -- the Iran deal during lawmakers’ questioning, he said that bolstering the nuclear pact would be a priority if he’s confirmed, adding that fixing the deal is in the country’s best interest. He noted that if the deal could not be fixed and the president continues to withdraw, he’d advocate for a tougher one.  As for the future of the deal as Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser John Bolton aims for possible regime change in Iran, Zarif said the U.S. “never abandoned the idea of regime change in Iran” and instead are just “more explicit about stating it.” Zarif said Iran is “ready” to restart its nuclear program if the Trump administration leaves the 2015 nuclear agreement and reinstates sanctions.  “We have put a number of options for ourselves, and those options are ready, including options that would involve resuming at a much greater speed our nuclear activities,” Zarif said.  “We have put a number of options for ourselves, and those options are ready, including options that would involve resuming at a much greater speed our nuclear activities,” Zarif states.  When CBS News interviewed Zarif in October, he said “nobody will trust” the U.S. to engage in any long-term negotiations if the Iran deal blows up. That includes North Korea, he said at the time — relevant now perhaps more than ever, as the U.S. looks to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the months ahead. “This is not a bilateral treaty between Iran and the U.S.,” Zarif said at the time. “So whatever domestic politicking he wants to do, that’s his business. You know, the United States is a permanent member of the Security Council. And if it’s not going to uphold a resolution, that not only it voted for but it sponsored, then the credibility of the institution that the United States considers to be very important would be at stake.” “Nobody else will trust any U.S. administration to engage in any long-term negotiation because the length of any commitment, the duration of any commitment from now on with any U.S. administration would be the remainder of the term of that president,” Zarif had said.
