Gholamali Khoshroo, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, has said that Iran is against the application of unilateral economic and trade measures against other countries.
 “The use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the sustainable development efforts of developing countries and generally has a negative impact on international economic cooperation as well as worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system,” he said during his speech at the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly. Following is the full text of his speech published by IRNA on Friday: The Islamic Republic of Iran associates itself with the statement delivered by Ecuador on behalf of the G77 and China. Let me thank the secretariat for the report under this item. Achieving Sustainable Development Goals depends on enabling the international environment through the provision of additional financing resources, capacity-building, transfer of technology, pro-development trade policies, and adequate means of implementation, equitable and effective participation of developing countries in global economic governance. Trade continues to be an engine of economic development and an instrument for socio-economic integration. Multilateralism remains to be the best and primary option for an international trading system to act as a fundamental driver of economic and social transformation. It provides a framework of rules, regulations and guidelines to which all members should adhere to. The United Nations Member States have strongly and repeatedly pronounced their commitment to promoting a universal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory, depoliticized and equitable multilateral trading system as an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. In line with the multilateral trading system, regional integration will continue to play a paramount role in determining the foreseeable economic future of billions of people, especially in the developing countries. Economic Cooperation Organizations (ECO) as a regional economic arrangement, under its 'Vision for 2025' has committed itself to expand trade volumes as a necessary requirement for its long term sustainable development. This vision, along with its associated plans of action, is expected to drive our region towards further regional integration, cohesion and sustainable development, especially through increasing regional cooperation in the areas of trade, energy, transportation, communications, welfare and environment. The UN should continue its support to the member states, in particular developing countries, in optimizing their national development plans and policies. In this regard, we value the work of UNCTAD and its pivotal role, particularly through its technical assistance and capacity building initiatives, in addressing the trade and investment challenges of all developing countries, such as delivering consultation to countries in the process of accession to WTO. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which has been experiencing economic coercive measures, remains opposed to the application of unilateral economic and trade measures against other countries. The use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the sustainable development efforts of developing countries and generally has a negative impact on international economic cooperation as well as worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system. Such measures constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter, as well as the basic principles of the multilateral trading system. Iran's economy has demonstrated its unparalleled potential for expansion and growth. Not only did economic sanctions fail to impede Iran, but instead solidified collective resolve to enhance domestic production. Achieving one of the highest global growth rate last year has proven that Iran's economy can become the most vibrant emerging economy within the next twenty years, with a trillion-dollar growth potential. Our strategic choice for achieving such sustainable and balanced growth is extensive global partnership. It is the policy of my Government to continue to steadily enhance the entrepreneurial environment, protect intellectual property rights, continuously improve corporate governance, and engage in a robust campaign against money-laundering in order to enhance a conducive legal climate for business and economic investments in various fields. In conclusion, I wish to express that the Islamic Republic of Iran fully stands ready to work closely with all relevant partners to ensure that our collective efforts in the Second Committee will bear best possible results.
