TEHRAN - Italy's Minister of Economy and Finance Pier Carlo Padoan has expressed readiness to pay a visit to Iran in near future to finalize pre-accorded financial and banking agreements with the Islamic country, Tasnim news agency reported on Saturday. During his meeting with his Iranian counterpart Ali Tayyebnia in Washington, Padoan also admitted that Italian banks and companies are decided to bolster bilateral ties with Iranians.  “We are committed to expansion of relations with Iran and keeping our made commitments to the country and will do our best to remove the obstacles on the way to expand bilateral ties,” he said. The Iranian minister, for his part, underlined the Islamic Republic’s post-sanctions general attitude for cooperating with foreign countries, which relies on transferring knowledge and technology into the country, saying that Iran investigates the proposed suggestions from other countries including Italy and expects them to try their best to remove barriers for development of common ties. Tayyebnia, heading a delegation, left Tehran for Washington DC on Friday to attend the World Bank Group (WBG)’s autumn meeting and International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s annual meeting.
