 “In such tough situations and events it becomes clear who is friend and who is enemy,” Velayati said during a meeting with Riza Hakan Tekin, the Turkish ambassador to Tehran.

A military coup attempt in Turkey on July 15 claimed the lives of more than 200 people and left nearly 1,500 others wounded. In a phone conversation with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on July 15 President Hassan Rouhani said, “Fortunately, the Turkish people showed great maturity in the coup and proved that forceful measures have no room in our region.” He said that Iran will stand beside the legitimate Turkish government. For his part, the Turkish ambassador praised Iran’s stance towards the coup. That the people rebelled against coup plotters helped strengthen democracy in Turkey, the diplomat noted. ‘Influential roles in Islamic world’ Velayati also said Iran and Turkey can play influential roles in shaping the future of the Islamic world. “Iran and Turkey are very important countries, among the Islamic countries, and can be influential in future of the world of Islam.”  The ambassador also said the ties between the two neighbors have been increasing over the past ten years.
