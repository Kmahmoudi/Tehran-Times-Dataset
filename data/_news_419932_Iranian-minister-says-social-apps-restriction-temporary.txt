TEHRAN – The restricted access to social networks in Iran amid ongoing protests against the government's economic and social policies is a temporary measure, Information and Communications Technology Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi said on Monday.

 On Sunday, media reported that Tehran had temporarily restricted access to social media apps Instagram and Telegram, used by activists to exchange messages about the rallies. “The rumors about the permanent closure of the social networks do not correspond to the reality. It seems that they seek to create social discontent and pessimism,” the minister wrote on his Twitter account. SP/PA
