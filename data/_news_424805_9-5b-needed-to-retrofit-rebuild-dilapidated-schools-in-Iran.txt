TEHRAN — A sum of 400 trillion rials (nearly $9.5 billion) is needed to retrofit and rebuild dilapidated school in Iran, head of a charity association tasked with building schools has said. Unfortunately the government cannot allocate such a budget to retrofit or rebuild school building, Amir Ne’mat Baniadam said, Fars reported on Tuesday.  Some one fourth of educational spaces in the country are dilapidated, he, said, adding that out of 6,000 schools in Tehran some 800 schools are old. In April director general of Tehran education department Abbasali Baqeri said that the highest number of old and dilapidated schools in Iran are in the capital with some of them aging 80 to 100 years old.  Despite the fact that these schools are listed as ‘ramshackle schools’ they still admit students annually and no one seems to care unless a disaster strike.
