TEHRAN – Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Tuesday that Iran will give crushing response to any act of aggression.
 “Today, area of space is not monopolized by the enemies. Iran has reached the power to give response that makes any aggressor regretful,” he said during a meeting with military personnel in Tehran. He added sanctions and pressures by the enemies are primarily aimed to weaken and overthrow the Islamic republic system. “The hegemonic system headed by the U.S. seeks to cause disappointment by showing that the Islamic government and system is inefficient. It has also formed a coalition with certain regional countries in the world to undermine the Islamic Republic of Iran. However, by the grace of God, the country has got more united and integrated,” he explained. Hatami said that the U.S. will face defeat in its confrontational policies against Iran. In spite of sanctions, Iran has turned into a great power in terms of defense capabilities. The defense minister added, “Some problems in the area of economy have been mainly caused by failure to use domestic resources and capacities properly. However, we will pass this stage through planning.”  NA/PA    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
