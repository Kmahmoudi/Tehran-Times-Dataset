President Bush has already initiated several wars and the prospects are that it could become global. The first war is against nominated terrorists. But who can tell a zealot from a mercenary or a psycho-terrorist and a psycho-patsy who takes the rap, or who provided the funds? And on what basis can anyone accept as true any claim after an act of terrorism that it was Al-Qaeda, given that they are so fragmented and decentralized? The only thing clear is whose foreign policy is actually benefiting from terrorism. Terrorist activity can be so easily kept ticking over by anyone of several interests, there is plenty of cannon fodder from those who have only known tyranny. Then there are those captured in Afghanistan and imprisoned in Cuba as so many units of suspended animation, which in today's world can be re-programmed and put to use. Recently it was reported that the Israeli national security advisor claimed that Palestinians and Al-Qaeda were planning a mega-terrorist strike against Israel on a scale of the Sept. 11 attack. But then we read that the Palestinian Security Forces arrested Israel collaborators posing as Al-Qaeda in Gaza. The second war is on nominated states which possess weapons of mass destruction, thus making themselves defensible against a superpower. In part this relates to kneecapping any state that has the capacity to become a power in the Middle East or Central Asia, with the exception of Israel. Iraq could be merely the first in the Middle East to endure the same fate as Yugoslavia -- change of government, dismemberment, foreign troops in occupation, and dependent on foreign investment to rebuild. The third war, which is unannounced, is a global psychological war based on the first two wars for the purpose of creating fear in order to exchange freedom and nationalism for "security" of the new world order. This is the same as the "managed chaos" of the infamous "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" and the diplomatic balancing act between war and peace that has been attributed to Kissinger, setting the stage for global government as a messianic institution for world peace. The greatest impetus for managed chaos is the foreign policy of attacking perceived enemy forces or threats according to one's own claims. This form of state terrorism, made famous by Israel, has been adopted by the U.S. This policy needs and breeds the terrorism that it uses to justify itself. It would be a shame if the UN failed to address this but looked to inherit the outcome. Especially now that the U.S. has high-handedly purged the Iraqi document regarding weapons of mass destruction to hide the truth about the companies from several of the permanent member nations of the UN Security Council that have supplied Iraq with the material and technology, thus justifying invasion so the Bush and Bin Laden people of the world can exploit Iraq's resources, create a bridgehead to the rest of the Persian Gulf oil resources, and later link in to Central Asia. The Bush speech about the axis of evil and pointing the bone at Iraq, Iran, and North Korea is a psychological abuse of the policy of pre-emptive strikes, with the invasion of Afghanistan as the context of the speech. We now have a crisis building up over North Korea and the same issue over nuclear power stations lies in wait for Iran when it pleases the U.S. Cutting off the oil supply to North Korea, as the U.S did to Japan, provoking Pearl Harbor, shows in practice that the U.S. is as pro-active for increasing wars as Bush speeches unashamedly indicate. The invasion of Iraq could provide an opportune time for a major war to break out on the Korean peninsula and Israel to implement a Nazi-style final solution of the Palestinian question, which nearly two hundred Jewish and Israeli academics have tried to appeal to the world to prevent. Fourth, another unannounced war against Bush's own constitution, people and their inherited freedom. The president spoke the truth when he said the U.S. was being attacked by people who hated their freedom. It is the biggest obstruction to the new world order. Their constitution was designed to protect the early Americans from the very same people. Twenty municipalities in the U.S. have taken action against the new Patriot Act. Returning to the backdrop of what arises from major wars, we see that out of World War I the Soviet Union and the League of Nations were formed. The threat to peace and the hope for peace. Then after World War II, the Cold War, Israel, and the United Nations were formed. Two factors now for the threat to peace using terrorism and one for the hope for peace. The thesis vs. antithesis balancing act between war and peace has dominated the last century. If the energy of mass terror and horror in World War II could create a Zionist regime (Israel) defying logic, truth, human rights, and Arab leaders as a microcosm of a world state, then the degree of horror the world will see, and Bush indicates no visible end of terror wars, for the nations to submit to a world state could be of apocalyptic proportions.
