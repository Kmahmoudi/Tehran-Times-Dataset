TEHRAN – Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani on Monday railed against recent U.S. Congress sanctions against Iran, saying Washington has pursued such a failed policy for decades. Speaking at a meeting of high-ranking judiciary officials in Tehran, Amoli Larijani said the Congress has turned out to be a “sanctions machine”, Tasnim reported. “They (U.S. officials) think they can put pressure on our nation through these measures, while they have repeated this failed experience for more than 30 years,” the top judge remarked.
