TEHRAN â€“ A needlework collection crafted by veteran artisan Marzieh Dizangian is on display at the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization (CHTHO) in Tehran. A dynamic entrepreneur and native of the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, Dizangian, has held several countrywide exhibits and workshops on the indigenous skill over the past couple of years. Needlework (Souzan Douzi in Persian) is a very common occupation among people of the province. It is the art of drawing images on plain fabrics by sewing delicate stitches using needle and colorful yarns. Organized under the auspices of the CHTHO exports department, the showcase comes to an end on March 1.
