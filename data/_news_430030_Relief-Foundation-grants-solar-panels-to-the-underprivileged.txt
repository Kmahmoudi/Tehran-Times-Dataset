TEHRAN – Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation (IKRF) has provided solar panels to financially struggling villagers in Khorasan Razavi province, northeastern Iran, to help them gain income. Solar-powered photovoltaic panels convert the sun's rays into electricity by exciting electrons in silicon cells using the photons of light from the sun, which is the cleanest, most reliable form of renewable energy, and can be used in several forms to help generate electricity along with income. The Relief Foundation have granted a budget amounting to 250 million rials (nearly $6,000) to each family under its coverage, living in Chah-Nasar village in Neyshabour county located in Khorasan Razavi province, Mehr reported on Saturday. So, the residents managed to purchase a number of solar panels which constantly generate electricity and help them earn monthly income through selling the generated power to the country’s grid. IKRF is an Iranian charitable organization, founded in March 1979 to provide support for deprived families along with helping them regain financial stability. It focuses mostly on generating sustainable jobs for the low income individuals rather than allocating only an amount of money.  Hojatollah Abdolmaleki, an official with the Foundation has said that the foundation has generated over 34,000 job opportunities for the deprived individuals in the first six months of the current [Iranian calendar] year (March 21-September 22).
