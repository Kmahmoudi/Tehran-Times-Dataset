TEHRAN- The United States has been sanctioned by Iran's Foreign Ministry for violating human rights, funding terrorism, and inciting violence against the Iranian people during the recent riots. The ministry stated in a statement on Monday that the penalties were implemented in accordance with a law established by the Iranian Parliament in 2017 titled "Countering America's Human Rights Violation and Adventurous and Terrorist Actions". For violating human rights, meddling in Iran's internal affairs, inciting violence and riots in the country, encouraging terrorist acts, thwarting Tehran's efforts to combat terrorism, and increasing pressure on the Iranian people that amounts to economic terrorism, the Islamic Republic has imposed sanctions on 10 American individuals and 4 American entities. This list includes: -  Michael Erik Kurilla, the commander of United States Central Command -  Gregory M. Guillot, the deputy commander of United States Central Command -  Scott Desormeaux, the commander of US airbase in Erbil, Iraq -  Juan Zarate, chairman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Economic and Financial Power (CEFP) -  Mark Wallace, the CEO of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) -  Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo, the United States deputy secretary of the Treasury -  Alexus G. Grynkewich, the commander of Ninth Air Force (Air Forces Central) -  Anne Neuberger, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology -  Isaac Johnson, Jr., the commander of the United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command -  Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, in addition to: -  United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) -  Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) -  The Ninth Air Force -  National Guard of the United States As a result of what they claim is a harsh crackdown on violent protesters following the death of a woman of Kurdish descent in police custody in the nation's capital, Tehran, the U.S. administration and its European allies have introduced restrictive measures against a number of Iranian people and organizations over the past few weeks. According to Iran's intelligence ministry, the U.S. and Britain were "directly" involved in the most recent riots, and hundreds of terrorists with ties to the Zionist regime and anti-revolutionary organizations were also apprehended during the turmoil. In a statement released on Friday, the Iranian Intelligence Ministry and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Intelligence Organization pointed to the significant role that foreign intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA, had in planning the violent riots in Iran. Following the passing of Mahsa Amini in September, riots erupted in certain Iranian cities. The 22-year-old fainted inside the police station before being declared dead at the hospital. According to an official report by Iran's Forensic Medicine Organization, Amini's contentious demise was brought on by a disease as opposed to reported blows to the brain or other important body parts. The rioters have been on the rampage around the country, assaulting security personnel, damaging government property, and defiling sacred places of worship. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry revealed late last month that Western governments and their mercenary media had supported the rioters, spreading false information and distorting the sequence of events that resulted in Mahsa Amini's death even before the official investigation into the incident was complete.
