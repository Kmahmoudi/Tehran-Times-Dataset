TEHRAN - Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi reiterated on Monday that Europe should not just express political support for the 2015 nuclear deal, saying Europe should pay the price if it wants to save the international agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 Speaking at the 9th round of Iran-Norway political consultations, Araqchi said the international community has not responded properly to the U.S. illegal act in withdrawing from the JCPOA. “The U.S. proved that it does not understand language of respect and interaction and can just talk with language of bullying,” he said. For his part, Tore Hattrem, the secretary general of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, said Oslo supports the JCPOA. U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal in May 2018 and ordered reimposition of sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. Also, on April 22 the U.S. announced that Washington has decided not to extend waivers allowing major importers to continue buying oil from Iran when they expire in early May. On January 31, France, Germany and Britain announced the creation of INSTEX, a special purpose vehicle aimed at facilitating legitimate trade between European economic operators and Iran.  During a meeting with a group of Austrian MPs in Tehran on Sunday, Araqchi said that Iran’s patience is not limitless and will give a proper response to the United States’ illegal actions soon. “The Islamic Republic’s patience is not limitless and will give a proper response to America’s illegal actions soon by comprehensive assessment of the current situation far from emotional reactions,” Araqchi asserted. He also criticized Europe’s delay in implementing its special mechanism to save the nuclear deal. “We welcome political position of the European Union, but political support will be of no help to save the JCPOA. The JCPOA is not an economic agreement and has security nature. If it matters to Europe, it should also pay the costs to keep it,” added Araqchi who acted as senior nuclear negotiator with the 5+1 group and the European Union in crafting the JCPOA.
