TEHRAN — Code Pink, an internationally active NGO working to end U.S.-funded wars and occupations, paid a visit to a permanent fair highlighting social achievements of the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam to empower the deprived and eliminate deprivation on Tuesday.
 Code Pink is a women-led grassroots organization working to end U.S. wars and militarism, support peace and human rights initiatives and aiming to redirect resources into health care, education, green jobs and other life-affirming activities. The organization was founded in fall 2002 as a grassroots effort to prevent the U.S. war on Iraq, and to continue to organize for justice for Iraqis and to hold war criminals accountable. The group actively oppose the continuing U.S. war in Afghanistan, torture, the detention center at Guantanamo, spy drones, and U.S. support for the Israeli occupation of Palestine and repressive regimes. The group’s visit to Iran, from February 23-March 3, is organized as a reaction to the U.S. administration’s uncompromising attitudes towards Iran. A coalition of peace groups has put together a peace delegation to Iran in an attempt to have a significant impact in helping move the two nations from a place of hostility and military threats to a place of mutual respect and peace with one another. The group paid a short visit to the fair and were briefed on the achievements of the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam, especially efforts exerted on empowering breadwinner women and creating jobs for them. Over their short stay they have also met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The group has also paid a visit to the Iranian Parliament (Majlis). Code Pink has also visited Tajrish Bazaar, a market in northern Tehran. “Great day today visiting Tajrish Bazaar on our peace delegation. We made new friends and heard stories about sanctions,” co-founder of Code Pink Medea Benjamin tweeted on Tuesday.
