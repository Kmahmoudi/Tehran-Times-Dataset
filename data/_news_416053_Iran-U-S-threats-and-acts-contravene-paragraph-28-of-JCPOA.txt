TEHRAN - Gholamali Khoshroo, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, said on Friday that threats and irresponsible actions from some senior officials of the U.S. administration are against paragraph 28 of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the official name for the July 2015 nuclear deal.
 The comments by Khoshroo came in response to a statement issued by the U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley on August 15 in which she claimed “Iran cannot be allowed to use the nuclear deal to hold the world hostage.” In addition to making some accusations against Iran such as support for terrorism, Nikki also said, “the nuclear deal must not become ‘too big to fail’.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned on Tuesday that Iran will quit the nuclear agreement “in hours” and return to the previous stage if sanctions are re-imposed on the country. Following is the full text of Khoshroo’s statement published by IRNA: The 15th August press statement by the U.S. Ambassador to the UN on Iran is devoid of any shred of truth. The rhetoric and baseless accusations against Iran contained therein represent the latest examples of a series of provocative words, outright threats and irresponsible actions from some senior officials of the U.S. administration in demonizing Iran and undermining the JCPOA inconsistent with the US commitments under paragraph 28 of the nuclear deal. Instead of distorting the recent remarks of President Rouhani, the U.S. Ambassador should heed the lessons of history and counsel some of the US administration officials to avoid repeating past mistakes. President Rouhani, in his remarks on 15 August, stressed that 'Iran lives up to its JCPOA commitments and would proportionately respond to any violation of the JCPOA by other participants. Those who attempt to revert to language of sanction and threat, are prisoners of their past delusions, and by fearmongering and antagonizing they would only deprive themselves from the benefits of peace. The U.S. blunders and military interventions in the Middle East during the last two decades have destabilized the region and fueled violent extremism, terrorism and tensions. The hardline and parochial positions adopted by certain senior U.S. officials against Iran could further exacerbate instability in the region. Iran as a stabilizing force in the region is acting responsibly in eradicating Daesh (also known as ISIS) in Syria and Iraq and remains determined to seek a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Middle East free from extremism, terrorism, extra-regional interventions and weapons of mass destruction. Iran stands ready to continue cooperation with the regional States to achieve the shared goals and to address the existing regional challenges.
