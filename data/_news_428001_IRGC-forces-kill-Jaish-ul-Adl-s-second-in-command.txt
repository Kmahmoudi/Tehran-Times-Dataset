TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Ground Force commander said on Friday that his forces have killed the second-in-command of the so-called “Jaish-ul-Adl” terrorist group in southeast Iran. In an operation in Saravan in Sistan-Balouchestan Province on Friday, the IRGC Ground Force’s Quds Unit managed to kill four members of Jaish-ul-Adl and injured two others, Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour said, Tasnim reported. After identifying the terrorists’ dead bodies, it was determined that the group’s second-in-command, Mulla Hashem Nokri, is among them, he added. Nokri had been in charge of some terrorist operations of the terrorist groups over the past years, the commander remarked. The IRGC Ground Force's Quds Base, in a statement earlier on Friday, had said that in the heavy clash with the terror group, the IRGC troops killed four terrorists and injured two others, adding that a number of other terrorists escaped to a neighboring country.    During the operation, not only no casualties were inflicted on the Iranian forces but also the terrorists’ ammunition and equipment were seized, according to the statement. Back in March, the IRGC Ground Force’s Quds Base said its forces had killed two suicide attackers in Sistan and Balouchestan before the terrorists could storm a border post with their explosive-laden vehicle. Since a couple of years ago, the IRGC has been tasked with ensuring the security of southeastern border areas in cooperation with local residents. Located in the southeast of Iran, Sistan and Balouchestan borders Pakistan and Afghanistan and has a long coastline by the Sea of Oman.
