TEHRAN- The Norwegian oil and gas company, DNO, submitted the results of its study on development of Changouleh oilfield in western Iran to Iranian National Oil Company (NIOC) on Saturday, Shana reported. The Norwegian company, which is focused on the Middle East-North Africa region and the North Sea, had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with NIOC for conducting development study on the oilfield in last November. In a meeting held in Tehran to submit the study results, Jeroen Regtien, the chief operating officer of DNO, said: “After signing the MOU in last November we set up an expert team and tried to offer an innovative plan for development of this oilfield.” NIOC Deputy Managing Director for Engineering and Development Gholamreza Manouchehri for his part expressed hope that this study project will lead to more cooperation between the two companies. Changouleh, discovered in 1999 but never developed, is estimated to hold more than two billion barrels of oil-in-place. Iran has signed MOUs also with Thailand’s state-run PTTEP and Russia’s Gazprom Neft in last December on conducting development study on this field.
