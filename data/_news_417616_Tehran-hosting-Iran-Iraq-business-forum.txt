TEHRAN- The two day Iran-Iraq business forum kicked off at the Tehran’s Summit Conference Hall on Sunday, IRNA reported. As reported, Iran’s Vice President for Economic Affairs Mohammad Nahavandian, a director from Supreme National Security Council, and the CEO of Iran Mercantile Exchange Hamed Soltaninejad, as well as Iraqi deputy ministers of trade and industry, senior advisor to the prime minister of Iraq and senior advisor to the governor of Central Bank of Iraq are taking part in the event. “Iran-Iraq trade is predicted to reach $20 billion,” the Iranian Head of Iran-Iraq Joint Chamber of Commerce Yahya Ale-Es’haq was quoted as addressing the held business forum.  Lamenting that economic ties between the two sides have not been expanded in parallel with the political bonds, Ale-Es’haq noted that to increase mutual economic relation it is vital to remove the existing obstacles in the fields of banking, transportation, issuance of passports, and customs affairs.  As Tasnim news agency quoted Iraqi deputy trade minister, “Iraq needs to cooperate with Iran in the fields of industry, agriculture, construction, and grain elevators." “To develop our country, we welcome cooperation of Iranian companies; however, there are some difficulties in bilateral banking relations which should be removed,” he added.   HJ/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
