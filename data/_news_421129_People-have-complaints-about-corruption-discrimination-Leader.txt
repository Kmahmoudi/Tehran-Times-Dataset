TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Thursday that the people have complaints about corruption and discrimination, urging three branches to counter corruption.
 “The people have complaints about corruption and discrimination. The people will tolerate most of the problems, but they are complaining of corruption and discrimination and will not brook it; therefore, the officials of the three branches of government must seriously counter corruption,” Ayatollah Khamenei said during a meeting with some of the commanders and personnel of the Air Force and the Army’s Air Defense Base on the occasion of the historic pledge of allegiance by Homafaran (Air Force officers in the previous regime) to the founder of the Islamic Republic, the late Imam Khomeini, on February 8, 1979. The Leader highlighted “understanding the people,” adding, “Who are the people? The people are those who create the February 11 [rallies marking the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution] epic every year; the people are those who, after rioters became involved, stepped back even if they had had a complaint and entered the fray on December 22. These are our people. Do not mistake them. Know the people and work for the people sincerely and to gain God’s satisfaction, because God has requested us officials to be the servants of the people and serve them.”   “By the grace of God, the participation of the people in February 11 rallies this year will be greater and more fervid than ever and everyone will attend.”   He also said that change and development are parts of the nature of the Revolution and added, “Now that the Revolution is entering its 40th year, the fundamentals and basics have remained stable and fixed; however, from this mighty tree with deep roots have emerged fresh and new fruits.” He said the key objective of the enemies in battling the Islamic Revolution is to prevent the emergence of new fruit and the continuation and endurance of the Revolution. “They utilize self-proclaimed thinkers, fake theoreticians, mercenary journalists and writers, clowns and all of the facilities of cyberspace to affect the people; however, on some divine days such as February 11, December 22, 2009, or December 22 this year, and in the spontaneous, passionate and fervent rallies following those occasions, people flock to the streets and ruin the calculations of the enemy by chanting a single slogan in unisons,” the Leader said. He described the February 11 rallies this year as an example of the love and respect of the people for the Revolution and added, “Due to the nonsense words and blabber of some U.S. and non-U.S. statesmen this year, the people sense that the enemy is setting up an ambush and seeks to carry out hostile acts and, therefore, by the grace of God, the participation of the people in February 11 rallies this year will be greater and more fervid than ever and everyone will attend.”    ‘U.S. created Daesh’ Ayatollah Khamenei said that Daesh was created by the U.S. and that the incumbent U.S. president, Donald Trump, referred to this fact in his election campaign. “As well as creating Daesh, the Americans supported them and savage U.S. bodies such as Blackwater were likely responsible for the teaching of some violent and brutal methods; however, despite all these cruelties and hard-heartedness, the U.S. government lays claims to be a supporter of human rights and the oppressed and animal rights in international propaganda and they must be shamed through the expression of these realities,” he said. He also described the 70-year oppression against the Palestinian nation and the support for the massacre of Yemeni people and brutality against them as clear examples of the tyranny of the U.S. (Source: leader.ir)   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
