TEHRAN - Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the parliament speaker, has said that President Donald Trump is responsible for anything happens to the U.S. forces in the Middle East region.
 “Various resistance forces in the region have targeted U.S. forces, and the regional sensitivity to the U.S. provocative behavior in the region has increased. This is not beneficial to the U.S. military men in the region and will never be beneficial to the U.S. policies.  “Trump, John Bolton [the national security advisor] and [Mike] Pompeo [the secretary of state] are responsible for anything happens to the U.S. forces in the region,” ISNA quoted him as saying on Monday in an interview with the al-Alam TV station. He also described Washington’s actions against Iran as “show” that comes from Trump’s frustration in taking a practical action against Iran which plays an important role in the region. Trump labeled the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps as terrorist organization on April 8. Immediately after the announcement, the Iranian Supreme National Security Council named the CENTCOM a terrorist organization, and the U.S. government a sponsor of terror. President Hassan Rouhani said on April 10 that the U.S. is aware of the consequences if it takes more steps than “slogans” against the IRGC.
