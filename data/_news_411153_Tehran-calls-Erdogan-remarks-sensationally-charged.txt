TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry rejected on Wednesday the accusations by the Turkish President that it was meddling in Iraq, calling the remarks “sensationally charged”. “It seems that the remarks by Mr. Erdogan are sensationally charged and influenced by the context,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi commented. Reportedly, Erdogan had accused Iran of influence peddling in Iraq and Syria, and promoting Persian nationalism in those countries during an appearance with Bahraini officials in Manama on Sunday. “Stability and security are Iran’s top priorities in the region,” the Iranian diplomat stressed.   While the two neighbors have been long-standing political and economic partners, they diverge on what is going on in Syria and Iraq. In Syria, the two back opposite sides, with Iran supporting President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey demanding him step down. Tehran also opposes intrusion into the Syrian territory by the Turkish army, saying it will only complicate the prospect to end the bloody war, that's been going on for six years now. Turkey on the other hand supports a buffer zone to be established in its northern borders with Syria where Kurdish militia fight ISIS forces. Turkey sees ground gained by Peshmerga fighters in the area as a cause for concern and a direct threat to its national security, already challenged by suicide bombers who sympathize with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. Erdogan’s anti-Iran remarks are open to question when it comes to the Iraqi battlefield. Baghdad has repeatedly confirmed that Iran’s advisory role in the Arab country is at the formal request of the Iraqi government. Last week Iraqi President Fouad Masum “hailed the prominent role” of commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, Major General Qassem Soleimani, in Iraq. “The U.S. and other European countries have also military advisors in Iraq, so one cannot say that Iranian military advisors are not allowed in Iraq,” he stressed. Meanwhile, relations between Ankara and Baghdad have been strained after Turkey sent hundreds of troops to the Bashiqa region to train anti-ISIL fighters. Baghdad labels the move as a violation of its sovereignty and demands Turkish withdrawal, a call which Ankara ignores.
