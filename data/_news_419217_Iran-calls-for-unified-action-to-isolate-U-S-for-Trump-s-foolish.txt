TEHRAN – Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani has called on Muslim countries to end their ties with the United States over President Donald Trump’s “foolish” decision to recognize al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of the Zionist regime. “Nothing has broken the hearts of Muslims more than Trump's move,” Larijani told a parliament session on Sunday, Press TV reported. Even Washington’s European allies have condemned the “unacceptable and irrational” move, he said. Trump on Wednesday announced that the U.S. was recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and had instructed his administration to begin the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the ancient city. The incendiary decision has drawn firm condemnation from across the world and sparked protests in the Middle East, leading to clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces. “None of the former U.S. presidents had such an unacceptable behavior, but the incumbent president took the imprudent measure after phone calls with several leaders of Arab states,” Larijani said. He said Muslim nations should suspend their political ties with the U.S. until Trump realize the depth of his “disgraceful” behavior towards Muslims. “And if they have a higher will, Muslims are expected to halt their trade relations with the U.S. so that this fraudulent, business-minded president understands that he cannot trade with the dignity of Muslims,” he added. The parliament speaker said according to confidential reports, Trump’s decision was “already coordinated with some countries as part of shoring up the Zionist regime, normalizing relations with the regime, and consigning the tragic drama of the Palestinian nation to oblivion, which means the countries involved have put all their dignity up for auction.” “We wouldn't like to believe these reports but simple calculations show what a scandal America has created through this adventure and that if Muslim and Arab countries do not distance themselves from it, nothing will be left of their dignity and they will have Muslim nations stand up against them.” On Friday, Palestinian officials expressed concerns that Saudi Arabia has been working for weeks behind the scenes to press them to support a nascent U.S. peace plan. Four unnamed Palestinian officials told Reuters that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas discussed in detail a grand bargain that Trump and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser, are expected to unveil in the first half of 2018. One of the officials said Prince Mohammed asked Abbas to show support for the U.S. administration’s “peace efforts” when the two met in Riyadh in November.
