TEHRAN – Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, has addressed the important role the university and scientific elite play in increasing Iran’s national strength. In a meeting with a group of academic elites and outstanding scientific talents on Wednesday, Ayatollah Khamenei addressed several issues of scientific essence and their role in increasing national strength. The meeting highlighted the Leader’s appreciation for Iranian youth, especially those who are talented and have played a decisive role in pushing Iran forward in various fields. “The presence of the youth, especially talented youth, engenders hope wherever they are. I truly thank God that now after the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished in our country, this lively, energetic, promising meeting is being held in person once again,” the Leader said, according to a readout put out by khamenei.ir.  Over the last years, Iran has made strides in achieving scientific progress despite the fact that the country has been under severe sanctions that impinged on Iran’s scientific interaction with the world. Moreover, several Iranian prominent scientists were assassinated by the enemies for contributing to Iran’s progress, which has become possible largely because of the knowledge generated by young scientists.  This explains why the Leader described talented youth as one of the most precious assets of Iran.  “Talented individuals are among the most important assets of the country. When we recognize that the talented are a great wealth, we will endeavor to nurture talented individuals, we will understand that losing them is a loss, and we will prevent this loss as much as possible,” the Leader said.  But Iran’s movement toward progress has not been without problems, which have largely sprung from the enemies’ activities. The Leader made it clear that the enemies have focused on universities with the aim of throwing a wrench into Iran’s progress.  “Universities are a key pillar for the country’s progress. Enemies of the country’s progress value any opportunity that can harm, close, or cripple universities. Universities are one of the largest obstacles standing in the way of the arrogant powers’ domination,” Ayatollah Khamenei said.   The Leader said the world’s bullying powers seek domination over nations. He explained the modality of this desire. “World’s bullying powers seek to dominate. How? One day with weapons, one day with deception, and one day with science. Universities prevent their domination. If you are able to elevate the scientific status of the country, you have created an obstacle to the enemy’s domination,” Ayatollah Khamenei said.  The Leader also appreciated the scientific breakthroughs made by Iran. “Any issue our scientists have focused on, they’ve carried out tasks revered by the world: stem cells and animal cloning, sending satellites into space, humanoid robots, nuclear technology, building advanced missiles and drones, and making vaccines, specially COVID vaccines,” he said.  Ayatollah Khamenei also took a jab at those who once belittled Iran’s military advances but now highlight the danger of them. “A few years ago, when pictures of our advanced missiles and drones were published, they said they are photoshopped pictures! Now they say Iranian drones are dangerous. Why do you sell them to so and so? These are feats carried out by Iranian elites. They bring honor to our country,” he said.     All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
