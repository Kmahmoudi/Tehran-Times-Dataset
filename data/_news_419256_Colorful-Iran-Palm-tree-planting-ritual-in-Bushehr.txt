TEHRAN – In the southern province of Bushehr, local people plant palm trees during a special ritual. They plant the saplings of palm trees in September and March and for the locals, palms are considered as sacred trees.   When they transfer the palm sapling to the palm grove, they put it toward Qibla (the direction that should be faced when a Muslim prays), believing that it makes it fruitful.  They recite four small surahs from the Holy Quran, known as “Chahar Qul” (four surahs beginning with letter ‘q’), when they start planting a palm tree. Various tribes and ethnic groups who live in different parts of Iran are just like colors, which make a great painting. Iran is home to about 20 ethnic groups who live in different regions of the country.
