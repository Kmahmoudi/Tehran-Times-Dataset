TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian warned on Thursday that Israel and certain Western politicians that have made conspiracies to foment civil war in Iran and break up the country must know that Iran is neither Libya nor Sudan. “Security services, the fake Israeli regime and certain Western politicians that have engineered plots to spark civil war, destroy and break up Iran must know that Iran is neither Libya nor Sudan," Amir Abdollahian wrote on his Twitter account. The chief diplomat added the foes have vicious eyes on “Iran’s territorial integrity and identity” but “people’s shrewdness has upset” them. Several Iranian cities have been the scene of riots since mid-September, which erupted after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who fainted at a police station in Tehran and was pronounced dead three days later in hospital. Some people used the tragic death of Mahsa Amini as an excuse to commit acts of violence and even terrorism. They have been injuring and killing security forces, including policemen. Just around sunset on Wednesday the villains committed a despicable act of terror in Izeh in the southwestern province of Khuzestan, killing 7 people, including a nine-year-old boy and woman. The attack in Izeh took place in the city’s central market that is frequented with shoppers. Also, on Wednesday night militants attacked security forces in Isfahan killing three security forces. Persian speaking media outlets based in the West, mainly Iran International, BBC Persian, Manoto and VOA, have been inciting the youth through a vicious disinformation campaign. Kazem Gharibabadi, secretary of Iran's High Council for Human Rights who was in New York, has said the role of such media is not less than acts of terrorism.
