TEHRAN – Collections of superb silk carpets handcrafted by Iranian and Thai weavers have been put on show at a four-day exhibition, which opened to the public at Bangkok’s Gaysorn Village on Thursday.  The exhibit is aimed to deepen Thai - Iranian ties with handicrafts in particular and to draw public attention to sericulture. It also features rugs with elaborate motifs that bear special techniques in production, the National News Bureau of Thailand reported. A delicate Persian pictorial rug depicting the late King Bhunibol Adulyadej -- the ninth monarch of Thailand – was highly welcomed by Thai officials and visitors when it was unveiled during the opening ceremony of the expo, IRNA reported. The event is a collaboration between the Iranian Embassy; Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mining and Trade; the Thai Airways International; the World Crafts Council – Asia Pacific Region as well as the ASEAN Handicraft Promotion and Development Association,  the bureau said. Iran exported $89 million of hand-woven carpets during the first four months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21- July 22, 2017), showing an increase of 3.7 percent year on year.
