He added, “The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that today, the international community has been challenged by unilateralism more than ever. Problems and complexities such as terrorism, extremism and drug trafficking have made multilateralism more essential.”  He said that the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is an important achievement of multilateral diplomacy which proved that if there is a political will, it will be possible to solve any problem through dialogue rather than sanctions and war.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran has fulfilled all its obligations based on 15 reports issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but unfortunately, the United States unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA and threatens other parties and countries to violate the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls for normal trade relations with Iran,” he said. Rouhani urges the remaining parties to the JCPOA to fulfil their obligations as soon as possible to make sure that Iran enjoys the economic benefits of the deal.
