TEHRAN – Kamal Kharrazi, head of the Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, says Iran would not remain silent if the remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear deal fail to fulfill their commitments. In an interview with ISNA published on Wednesday, Kharrazi said implementation of the special purpose vehicle (SPV) will depend on European countries’ determination. “They have taken some steps in this regard and in the dialectic and political arena they have done good things,” he said. “But these steps will be deemed notable only when the [SPV] is implemented.” The U.S. reimposed economic sanctions on Iran after it unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May. The sanctions affect Iran’s oil exports and most other trade in addition to banking transactions. As a result, major European countries have promised Iran to set up the SPV to allow trade on a barter model, rather than using normal banking transactions.  European officials have said that the SPV can be implemented by the end of 2018. However, so far Europe has been unable to find a country to host the mechanism. Kharrazi said if such efforts fail, it does not mean Iran will leave the JCPOA, but it will be up to Iran’s top leadership to decide what to do. The veteran politician suggested that Iran should become self-sufficient in the face of U.S. sanctions in order to get through the era of maximum pressure by the bullying U.S. government. Pointing to Iran’s cooperation with other countries, the former foreign minister said Tehran is in constant talks with other countries to develop its ties. He also described the JCPOA as a source of security and a prelude to expand ties between different countries, some of which are suffering from the tyrannical government of the United States.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
