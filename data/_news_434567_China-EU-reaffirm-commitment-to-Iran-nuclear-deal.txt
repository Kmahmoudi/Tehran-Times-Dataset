TEHRAN - China and the European Union (EU) have reaffirmed their commitment to the continued, full and effective implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.

 The reaffirmation came as China and the EU issued a joint statement after the 21st meeting of their leaders in Brussels on Tuesday afternoon, Xinhua reported. The deal was initially inked in 2015 between Tehran and six world countries, namely the U.S., Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany. Last May, however, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the JCPOA – which had been negotiated under his predecessor – and re-imposed the anti-Iran sanctions that had been lifted under the landmark deal. Despite Washington’s withdrawal, Iran has not left the deal yet, but has stressed that the remaining signatories to the agreement need to effectively offset the negative impacts of the U.S. pullout on Iran if they want Tehran to remain in it. China and the EU recalled that the JCPOA is a key element of the global non-proliferation architecture and a significant diplomatic achievement endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council, the statement said. The two sides “reaffirm their commitment to its continued, full and effective implementation, as well as their efforts to preserve economic benefits for Iran,” it said. They recalled the importance of the Arak modernization project, and the need to continue their common efforts in this regard, it said. In April 2017, Iran and China signed the final version of a contract to redesign and modernize the Arak heavy water reactor. According to the agreement, the Chinese side is to review the new design of the Arak reactor made by the Iranian experts and confirm its compliance with the international safety standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). China and the EU in their Tuesday statement welcomed the fact that the IAEA has confirmed in 14 consecutive reports the continued adherence by Iran to its nuclear-related commitments. SP/PA
