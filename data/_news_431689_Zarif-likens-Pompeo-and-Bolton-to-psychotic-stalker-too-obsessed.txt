TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday likened U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton to “psychotic stalkers” who are extremely obsessed with Iran.

 "While ordinarily it might be flattering, @SecPompeo’s and @AmbJohnBolton’s pure obsession with Iran is more and more like the behavior of persistently failing psychotic stalkers," Zarif tweeted. Zarif the U.S. is in fact "substituting a real foreign policy with Iran- obsession and -phobia." Speaking during a news conference with his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi in Amman on Tuesday, Pompeo said the U.S. was "redoubling not only our diplomatic but our commercial efforts to put real pressure on Iran." He also said the U.S. decision to pull out troops from Syria would not jeopardize Washington's efforts to counter threats in the region, which, he alleged, came from Iran and the Daesh terrorist group, Press TV reported. "The most significant threats to the region are Daesh and the Islamic Revolution," Pompeo said. Bolton also claimed on Sunday that Iran poses a threat to the region through its "quest for deliverable nuclear weapons." "We've got the continuing threat of Iran's quest for deliverable nuclear weapons," Bolton said during a joint declaration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
