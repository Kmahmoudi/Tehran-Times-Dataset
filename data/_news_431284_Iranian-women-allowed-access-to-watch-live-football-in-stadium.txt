TEHRAN – Iranian women are permitted to spectate a friendly match between Iran’s women’s football team and Russia’s in a women-only crowd at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran. The timing of the match is not out yet, although the sports ministry’s officials have given the green light to the women for attending the match. The last female Iranians who got to watch a football match live was in 1981. In November, around 500 women were permitted to join the 80,000 crowd attending the second leg of the Asia Champions League final in the capital between Persepolis and Japan’s Kashima Antlers. Some 100 women also watched the men’s national team’s friendly against Bolivia in October. The Iranian women who are football-mad will have a chance to watch the friendly match with Russia live.
