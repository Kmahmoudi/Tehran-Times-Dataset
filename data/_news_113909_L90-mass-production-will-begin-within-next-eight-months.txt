However, in comparison with other countries the delay in the introduction into the Iranian markets of L90 was not unpredictable, Iranâ€™s Labor News Agency ILNA quoted Sasan Qorbani as saying on Sunday. It is said that the L90 project in Iran has run into rough weathers but Qorbani maintained that, based on the information gathered from the domestic auto part maker companies. The preliminary model of the car has already been manufactured and if things go the way they are, mass production of the automobile will start within the next eight months. About 15,000 of the low-cost economy car have been planned to be produced in the first phase of the production, he maintained.
