Shamkhani says Trump uses sanctions for revenge In a separate meeting with the Azeri official, Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said that U.S. President Donald Trump is using sanctions as tool for revenge. In violation of the UN Security Council Resolution 2231, President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. Shamkhani said that the U.S. sanctions are illegal. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
