TEHRAN – Hassan Yazdani says that he will try from now on to repeat his gold medal at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Iranian wrestler came from six points down to beat Russian Aniuar Geduev in a dramatic men's -74kg freestyle gold medal bout in the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. “I really fought very hard and gave my heart out. The gold medal belongs to Iranian people and I am so glad to meet the expectations,” Yazdani told Mehr news agency. “I know my responsibility is heavier because everyone wants me to win gold medal from now on. I want to defend my title in the upcoming competitions, in particular Olympic Games,” the 21-year-old said. Geduev was favorite to win the gold medal after beating reigning Olympic champion Jordan Burroughs in the category. “Geduev is a very powerful wrestler and has won a bronze medal in the World Championships in Las Vegas. He defeated Burroughs and it shows he has high potential,” Yazdani added. “I am so happy for returning to my country with a valuable medal. Now, I need to rest for one month and then I will start my trainings. I want to repeat my goal in the upcoming competitions,” Yazdani concluded.
