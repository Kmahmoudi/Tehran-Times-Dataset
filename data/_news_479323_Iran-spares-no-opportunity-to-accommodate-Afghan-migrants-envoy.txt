He emphasized that despite being subject to unilateral and unlawful sanctions for the past 40 years, the Islamic Republic has made every effort to provide services to Afghan migrants. As a result, he urged the international community to refrain from creating new crises that would obscure the Afghan migrants' current predicament.

Antonio Vitorino, director general of the International Agency for Migration (IOM), noted that the organization has always praised Iranians for their generosity toward migrants and that in recent years it has worked to improve funding for Afghan refugees and support host nations like Iran.
