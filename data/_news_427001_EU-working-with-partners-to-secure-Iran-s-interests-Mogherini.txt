TEHRAN – EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Friday that the EU member states and their partners in the world will continue cooperation to make sure that Iranians and Iranian citizens can benefit from the nuclear agreement. “The IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency released its 12th report certifying that Iran is still complying with all its nuclear related commitments. This is good news,” Mogherini said, the EU website reported. The nuclear pact, also called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed in July 2015 between Iran and six world powers, but was unilaterally abandoned by the U.S. in May.
