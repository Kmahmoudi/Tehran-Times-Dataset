TEHRAN – The Chairman of Antalya Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) Davut Çetin has voiced the Turkish city’s interest in boosting trade relations with Iran. Çetin, heading a 20-member trade delegation, held talks in Tehran on Sunday with Iranian businessmen and entrepreneurs at the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (TCCIMA). Although Turkish entrepreneurs and businessmen from various sectors including tourism, agriculture, food, clothing, industrial machinery and equipment, as well as construction and architecture constituted the delegation, Çetin stressed tourism and agriculture as the main foci of their visit to Iran, according to TCCIMA website. As for the Iranian side, the secretary general of TCCIMA, Bahman Eshqi, stressed the expansion of bilateral trade relations between the two sides saying “Iran-Turkey’s annual non-oil trade turnover is estimated at near $4.3 billion which is relatively low considering the two countries’ potentials and capacities.” The official noted that Iran and Turkey have set a $30 billion trade turnover on the agenda for realization which both sides need to make effort. “Barriers related to banking, customs, transit, preferential tariffs and etc. should be removed for reaching greater economic cooperation,” he said.
