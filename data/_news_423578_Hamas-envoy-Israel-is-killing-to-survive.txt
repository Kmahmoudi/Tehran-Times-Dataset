TEHRAN – Khaled al-Qaddumi, the Hamas representative in Tehran, said on Monday that the Israeli regime cannot survive without the help of big powers, and that the regime is killing in order to survive. In a meeting on Palestine held in Tehran, al-Qaddumi said that peaceful demonstrations will be held in the occupied territories on Monday and Tuesday so that the ugly face of the occupying regime of al-Quds be unveiled, IRNA reported. He added, “Contrary to the belief that says the creation of the Zionist regime was the result of World War II… we should say that this regime was created from nothing and has no history and civilization.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
