TEHRAN- Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in an interview with Rossiya 24 TV channel that Iran has confirmed its plan to purchase 12 Superjet-100 aircrafts from Russia in the near future. He also noted that Russia is interested in establishing production of components for Russian aircraft in Iran, and, in case of the corresponding proposal is ready to consider such possibility, Tass reported. In addition, according to the minister, Russia has offered Iranian partners to establish joint production of turboprop upgraded Ilyushin Il-114 aircraft. "Our companies are currently working with Iranian partners to come up with specific solutions and proposals," Novak said. Iran is hoping to rapidly upgrade its fleet now that sanctions have been lifted under the 2015 nuclear accord, in which Tehran pledged to curb its nuclear program.
