TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Monday night censured the new U.S. sanctions which target ordinary Iranians, saying “U.S. hypocrisy knows no bounds.” “Trump Administration wants the world to believe it's concerned about the Iranian people. Yet the very first sanctions it reimposed have canceled licenses for sales of 200+ passenger jets under absurd pretexts, endangering ordinary Iranians. US hypocrisy knows no bounds,” Zarif said in a tweet. It comes as the U.S. reimposed economic sanctions against Tehran. The first set of sanctions target financial transactions that involve U.S. dollars, Iran’s automotive sector, the purchase of commercial planes and metals including gold. Sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector and central bank are to be reimposed in early November. In another tweet on Monday, the foreign minister drew attention to the fact that the United States is the first and only country to ever use nuclear weapons, saying “U.S. militarism hasn’t faded”. “Today in 1945, U.S. became 1st & only country to ever use nukes. And on an urban center of all targets. 73 yrs later - w/ vastly expanded nuke arsenal it refuses to dismantle in defiance of NPT commitment – U.S. militarism hasn’t faded. Neither has its utter disregard for human life,” he stated. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
