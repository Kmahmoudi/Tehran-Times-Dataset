TEHRAN– People’s Republic of China in its reaction to the US airstrikes on Friday in Iraq, which led to the martyrdom of IRGC Commander of Quds Force General Ghasem Soleimani, called for respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Geng Shuang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a daily briefing: “we attach high importance to the recent incidents. China has always opposed the use of forces in the international relations, and advocates that all parties should practically abide by the purpose and principle of UN Charter and basic norm of international relations." "The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq should be respected, and the peace and stability in the Middle East and Gulf area should be maintained," he added. "We urge all the relevant parties, especially the US, to exercise restraint and prevent the escalation of the tensions.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
