TEHRAN – Presidential candidate Mostafa Mirsalim has asked why anybody did not talk about the UNESCO 2030 education document before the issue was raised by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a few days ago.

 “The government gentlemen go bow to the UNESCO 2030 document while we have talks to talk in the education field,” Mirsalim said, Fars reported. He stressed that a domestic document defining a master plan for the Ministry of Education should be implemented instead. SP/
