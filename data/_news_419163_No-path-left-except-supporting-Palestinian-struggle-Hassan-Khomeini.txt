TEHRAN – Seyed Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of Imam Khomeini, said on Saturday that there’s no path forward for Muslim nations except supporting the Palestinian people’s struggle in the face of Israeli aggressions. In a statement, Khomeini said the U.S. president’s inhumane move to designate al-Quds as the capital of Israel is a blatant violation of Palestinian rights, ISNA reported. He also said Donald Trump’s “delusional” and “irrational” action was against international agreements, and showed the U.S. government’s hypocrisy for pretending to support peace and human rights.
