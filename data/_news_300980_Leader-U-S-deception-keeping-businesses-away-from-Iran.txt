TEHRAN – Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that the United States is scaring businesses away from Iran despite the fact that the nuclear deal had lifted financial sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
 “On paper the United States allows foreign banks to deal with Iran, but in practice they create Iranophobia so no one does business with Iran,” the Leader told hundreds of workers. The United States has resorted to “deception” to obstruct international trade with Iran despite the nuclear agreement, the Leader noted.  Ayatollah Khamenei gave reasons why Iran does not trust the U.S. “We are seeing what causes pessimism and cannot turn a blind eye to them… I have said time after time Americans cannot be trusted and the reason for this is becoming clear.” “We are seeing what causes pessimism and cannot turn a blind eye to them… I have said time after time Americans cannot be trusted and the reason for this is becoming clear.”  Also, on the issue of terrorism, the Leader said Americans are “worse than any other terrorists,” and as indicated by available evidence, Americans continue to aid terrorists. The Leader, who was speaking days before International Workers’ Day, also expressed gratitude to the country’s blue-collar community, conceiving of working as “value.” “Every working individual in the society, including officials, ministers, university professors, students, seminary students, managers, and all others are as such workers and in fact generate value,” the Leader noted. Ayatollah Khamenei said it is necessary to “resolve problems of the blue-collar community,” “boost domestic production,” “seriously counter goods smuggling,” and “ban import of goods with Iranian parallels.” ‘Workers’ role in resistance economy’ Pointing to responsibility of workers, businesses, and officials in implementing policies of resistance economy, the Leader said, “The main message of Resistance Economy, Action and Implementation is that officials should plan for every single article of general policies of resistance economy and implement them really.” The Supreme Leader further reminded that the most important responsibility of workers with regards to resistance economy is to work rightly, qualitatively, and strongly.
