Cecillia Edstroem, senior vice president of Scania corporate, told IRNA here Thursday that the buses are designed for intracity trips. "In defiance of enjoying the latest technology, the buses are operated with diesel fuel," she said. Scania was founded in 1891. Since then, the company has built and delivered more than one million trucks and buses. The company renders its services in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Australia. "We have signed some deals with Iran in the past, but it has not been a major market for us. Now we are working with a local enterprise," said Edstroem. She failed to give the exact number of buses the Swedish company will deliver to Iran, however added a few hundreds the Asian country will purchase.
