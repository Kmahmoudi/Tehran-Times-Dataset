TEHRAN – Marine travels from Oman have been facilitated with providing tourists with the right to ship their own vehicles to Iran’s Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf. The Bahman Pier is ready to serve Omani tourists who are willing to bring private cars to the island via the sea route two days a week, Farzin Haqdel, a local tourism official, said on Sunday. Last July, the two neighboring countries launched a cruise route that connects the port city of Khasab in Oman to the vast Iranian island. Iran aims to take advantage of southern coasts to make the best use of its maritime tourism potential by means of developing hospitality infrastructures, diversifying sea routes, and drawing private sector investors. Boom in maritime tourism can pave the way for Iran to meet its ambitious target of attracting 20 million annual tourists by 2025 as it also keeps an eye on tourism developments in the Caspian Sea in the north.
