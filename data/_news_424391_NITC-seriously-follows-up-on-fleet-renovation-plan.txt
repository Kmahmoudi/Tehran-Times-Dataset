TEHRAN- National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) is seriously following up its plan of renovating the fleet and reducing the average age of its tankers, according to a director of the company. Akbar Jebel-Ameli, the director for technical affairs and operations in NITC, told Fars news agency that his company is pursuing this plan for a more serious presence in the international markets. NITC prepared this five-year plan once the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran’s nuclear deal) was implemented in January 2016, he added. Last month, the company managing director, Nasrollah Sardashti, has announced that NITC has prepared a plan for the renovation of its fleet, adding “We have already demolished four tankers and two other tankers will be demolished soon based on the planning.” NITC, which operates the largest tanker fleet in the Middle East and has the world’s largest fleet of super tankers, transports Iranian crude and also acts as an independent entity in contracts with foreign concerns for crude oil transportation based on prevailing international freight rates.
