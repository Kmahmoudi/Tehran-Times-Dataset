TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian told European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Thursday with unequivocal words that it is not Iran’s policy to sell arms to Russia in its war with Ukraine. “We have defense cooperation with Russia, but our policy about the Ukraine war is to respect the territorial integrity of this country, not to deliver arms to the warring sides, to stop the war and end the displacement of the people,” Amir Abdollahian said in a telephone conversation with Borrell. The telephone conversation took place as certain Western officials and media outlets have been claiming that Iran is selling drones to Russia in its war against Ukraine. “We are against the war and strongly reject delivering drones to Russia in the war with Ukraine,” Iran’s foreign minister insisted. He said Tehran is insistent on its policy to end the clashes in Ukraine through diplomacy and “recommend the Europeans to have a realistic view toward this issue.” Elsewhere in his remarks, Amir Abdollahian said the Islamic Republic enjoys strong public support and an effective democratic system but certain European officials through a “wrong analysis” and of course with “specific political motivations” backed violence, terror and skirmishes in Iran under the pretext of defending human rights which was an “unmeasured, unconstructive and meddlesome” move. The foreign minister emphasized that the Islamic Republic of Iran’s policy is based on “logic,” “wisdom” and “diplomacy”, adding “Our foreign policy is not based on double-standards.” In the phone talks, Borrell also expressed hope about continuation of cooperation between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about Safeguards issues. Borrell also said Tehran’s policy in not selling weapons, including drones, to Russia is important and worthy of praise. The two chief diplomats also assessed the process of the Vienna talks to lift sanctions on Iran and reviving the 2015 nuclear deal -- JCPOA – as positive and forward-looking.
