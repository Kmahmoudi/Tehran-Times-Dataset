TEHRAN- World Health Organization (WHO) has established a separate team for providing Iran healthcare system with required medical devices.  The announcement was made by Christophe Hamelmann, the WHO representative in Iran, in a meeting with Iranian Health Minister Saeed Namaki, IRIB reported on Monday.  According to Hamelmann, the team includes WHO and some other organizations who cooperate with it, but the problem is that the medical device suppliers are not part of the team or cannot use the banking system for doing proper transactions.  Hamelmann added that there are many ways to meet the needs of Iran’s healthcare system and WHO will use all its capacities to help.  U.S. withdrew unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal in May 2018 and ordered sanctions against Iran. It has been repeatedly claimed by Trump administration’s officials that sanctions against Iran do not include food and medicine, however, in November, Washington Post said the sanctions on Iranian financial firms could endanger the flow of humanitarian goods as foreign banks and outside suppliers abandon business ties with their partners in Iran.  SJ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
