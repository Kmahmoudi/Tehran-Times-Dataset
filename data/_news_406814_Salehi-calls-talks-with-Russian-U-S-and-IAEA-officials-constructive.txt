TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Salehi, chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said on Monday that his talks with Sergey Kirienko, the head of Rosatom, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano were “positive” and “constructive”.
 Salehi had visited Vienna to participate in the 60th Regular Session of the IAEA.  The atomic chief also said Iran’s relations with Russia are “strategic” and confirmed a report that Russia had received 38 tons of heavy water from Iran about a week ago. “It is a big step that Iran could sell the U.S. and Russia 70 tons of heavy water within eight months after implementation of the JCPOA and the European countries are interested in buying heavy water from Iran and there are ongoing negotiations with them,” he stated. “We discussed arriving at a final conclusion as regards [Iran’s] nuclear activities and [the agency’s] monitoring activities that are underway either as part of the Safeguards [agreement], the Additional Protocol or the JCPOA,” Press TV quoted him as saying during the meeting with Amano. Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany - finalized the text of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in Vienna in July 2015. The agreement went into effect in January. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
