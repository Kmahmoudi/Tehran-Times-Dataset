Mahmoud Mousavi, speaking to reporters, said: "This new initiative of issuing 72-hour entry visas to investors and foreign businessmen has been made possible through a tie-up between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) office stationed in Shiraz International Airport and the BAFIA in this province. "Iranian companies in Fars Province wishing to host foreign businessmen and investors can apply for a visa 48 hours prior to the arrival of their guests by submitting to the MFA office in the province an invitation letter duly accomplished by a registered firm doing business in the province and a photocopy of the applicant's valid passport," he elaborated. Mousavi added: "Visas issued to foreign businessmen or investors who need to stay longer in the country for study and evaluation may have their visas promptly extended for another 72 hours, and in case his or her project reaches the operational phase a visa for a longer stay may be issued." He further said that "48-hour transit visas may be issued to passengers who enter Shiraz bound for other destinations." 
