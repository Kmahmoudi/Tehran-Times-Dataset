TEHRAN – Some 50 billion rials (some $12 million) has been allocated to restore the ruins of Rab’-e Rashidi, a 14th-century educational complex in East Azarbaijan, northwest Iran. The Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization is pursuing possible inscription of the site on the UNESCO World Heritage list by 2025. “Fortunately, a sum of 50 billion rials has been allocated to liberate free up properties, which are within its close vicinities,” CHTN quoted CHHTO Deputy Director Mohammad-Hassan Talebian, as saying on Sunday. A task force has been formed to caring out carrying out a comprehensive survey on rehabilitating the historical monument, he added. “When the complex is fully restored to its former glory, its potential to attract travelers would be as high as what the Persepolis has,” said Majid Khodabakhsh, the governor general of East Azarbaijan province. Rab’-e Rashidi was established during the reign of Ghazan, a ruler of the Ilkhanid dynasty. It embraces a paper factory, a library, a hospital (Dar-al-Shafa), a Quranic center (Dar-al-Quran), residential facilities for teachers, students’ quarters and a caravanserai amongst other facilities. Situated in northwestern city of Tabriz, the capital of East Azarbaijan, the complex includes several archaeological layers that date from Ilkhanid, Safavid and Qajar eras, Ajorlou added.
