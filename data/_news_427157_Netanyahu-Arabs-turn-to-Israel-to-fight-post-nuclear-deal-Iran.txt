Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted on Monday that certain Arab states have turned to Israel to fight Iran after Tehran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with the 5+1 nations.  

 “The agreement with Iran was a bad agreement in every respect except for one - it brought us closer to the Arab world on a scale that we never knew, and one of our goals is that it continues,” he said, according to i24NEWS.  Netanyahu underlined that Israel and certain Arab states are “in the midst of a diplomatic flourishing” in the context of the JCPOA, the official name for the nuclear accord.  “Another important thing is, of course, the fact that there is a gradual normalization with leading countries in the Arab world,” he stated.  Back in August, the Israeli prime minister claimed that “many Arab countries now see Israel not as their enemy but as their indispensable ally” in pushing back against Iran. Following Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8, Netanyahu praised President Donald Trump for what he described as a “brave decision”.  The exit was welcomed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain. The triple Persian Gulf littoral sates also backed decision to reimpose sanctions on Tehran.  AFM/PA      All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
