TEHRAN – Hamid Aboutalebi, a political advisor to President Hassan Rouhani, said on Monday that creating new crises is not a good way to overcome current crises, warning against plots targeting Iraq, Lebanon and other regional countries. “Such approach would not lead to security, stability and peace,” tweeted Aboutalebi in reference to the recent developments in Lebanon. He also said the only way to overcome such crises is to respect regional countries’ independence and sovereignty, fighting tyranny and occupation, and holding talks with mutual respect.
