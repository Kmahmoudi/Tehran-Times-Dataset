TEHRAN – Iranian deputy energy minister put the country’s current solar and wind farms capacity at 400 megawatts (MW) saying that the figure will increase to 1.4 gigawatts (GW) in the next Iranian calendar year (March 2018-March 2019).  Homayoon Haeri said: “At the moment, Iran’s power capacity is 80,000 MW and renewables have the potential to make up at least 20,000 MG of this number”, IRNA reported on Wednesday. The official noted that the country plans to add 1,000 megawatts (MW) or 1 gigawatt (GW) of new renewable power capacity every year over the next five years. Of the country’s total renewable capacity, wind power represents 141 MW, while the potential for wind power capacity in Iran is 100,000 MW.  Renewables, including hydropower, account for just six percent of energy generation, versus natural gas’ 90 percent share. In September 2017, Mohammad Sadeqzadeh, the head of state-held Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization, known as Satba, claimed that Iran’s renewables could come to account for a quarter of power generation by 2022.  Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence on the regional electricity market.
