TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani has condemned and described as rejected the meddlesome and delusional statements by the British foreign secretary about the developments in Iran, the Islamic Republic’s right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes and Iran’s regional role, according to the Iranian foreign ministry. “These baseless statements are part of the hostile political campaign that this country and other European countries are trying to advance against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said. “Britain and some other European countries, which must be answerable for their inhumane measures against the Iranian nation and be held accountable at international circles, undoubtedly lack any moral qualifications to level human rights claims and allegations against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Kanaani added. “Instead of leveling repetitious and unfounded allegations against the Islamic Republic of Iran’s role in the region, London would better stop creating divisions in regional countries and collaborating in crimes against humanity by selling fatal arms worth billions of dollars to some regional customers and leave the region’s peace and stability to its own states,” the official said. He added, “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear program has been fully transparent and peaceful; therefore, Britain, which is among the violators of the JCPOA because of acting in line with America, is in no position to make baseless claims and raise doubts about the nature of Iran’s nuclear program.” Kanaani once again dismissed London’s baseless claims about links between Iranian drones to the war in Ukraine, adding, “It is the Western parties that are making a political and peaceful resolution of this conflict more difficult by flowing a huge number of arms to the scene of this crisis.” “We advise the rulers in London to use their power to create stability in their own government, pay attention to the widespread demands of the country’s people and end discrimination and oppression against migrants and Muslims instead of leveling accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he added.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
