TEHRAN – Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Monday that the country is suffering from economic mismanagement, urging all branches of the government to cooperate in order to boost the economy. Referring to employment as one of the country’s toughest problems, Jahangiri said the government should stimulate the economy to create more job opportunities. He also said one of the roots of slow pace in economic development is the change of policies in different administrations that caused the country to fall behind countries like South Korea.
