TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Saturday that Tehran has not yet received any messages from the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council for dialogue between the two sides on the regional conflicts.
 The remarks by Qassemi came as the KUNA reported that Kuwait is contacting the Iranian officials to set a date to deliver message of the PGCC to Iran. “So far, Iran has received no proposal and specific date from the Kuwaiti brothers through diplomatic and official sources,” Qassemi told ISNA. Qassemi said that Iran will take proper decision upon receiving the message. Mohammad Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, the former Kuwaiti foreign minister, said on Thursday that Iran and the Arab bloc should hold talks on crises in the Middle East. He said that the consultations should be “real”, “constructive” and based on respecting the countries’ territorial integrity and in line with international regulations. Relations between Iran and the Persian Gulf littoral Arab states deteriorated over a list of issues.  A key bone of contention is the fate of President Bashar al-Assad where the two sides stand at stark contrast.  While Tehran has been an unfailing supporter of the Syrian government, the Arab states demand Assad step down.  The regional division has made it extremely demanding to restore peace to the region, particularly after the political standoff between Tehran and Riyadh.
