Less than a week after Pakistan was placed on the ‘grey list’ by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), close ally China came to Islamabad’s defence, asking the international community to recognize “enormous efforts and sacrifices” made by Pakistan to combat terrorism. “We will not comment on the decision of the task force. But we understand Pakistan has made enormous efforts for counter-terrorism and made great sacrifices,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said at a press briefing on Tuesday. “We always believe that Pakistani government and people have made enormous efforts and sacrifice on counter-terrorism and the international community should fully recognize this.” Pakistan was added to the FATF grey list of countries that are involved in providing financial aid to terrorism and related activities during the FATF plenary in Paris on Wednesday. According to FATF, Pakistan has made a ‘high-level commitment’ to work with the International monitoring body and Asia/Pacific group on Money Laundering (APG) to strengthen its anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regime. The proximity between China and Pakistan, especially after the signing of a lucrative economic deal, has grown, much to the consternation of the U.S. China is currently embroiled in a trade war with Washington and Pakistan has also recently fallen out with the U.S., which has brought them closer.
