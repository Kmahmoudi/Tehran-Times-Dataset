TEHRAN - The spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) said on Saturday that Tehran’s nuclear industry is completely impervious to attempts to undermine it, stressing that enemies have no option but to pursue diplomacy vis-à-vis the Iranian nuclear issue. "For our enemies, whose main goal is to undermine Iran's nuclear industry and scientists, there is no option left but diplomacy," Behrouz Kamalvandi said, Press TV reported. He criticized the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for issuing politically-motivated reports about Iran's nuclear activities, saying such statements have on numerous occasions portrayed a tarnished and negative image of the country at an international level. “A lot of good work has been carried out in the fields of radiopharmaceuticals and agriculture, and enrichment in the nuclear field is only a small part of it.”"The enemy is trying to make our nuclear industry only associated with enrichment in the minds of [the world’s] peoples. This is while a lot of good work has been carried out in the fields of radiopharmaceuticals and agriculture, and enrichment in the nuclear field is only a small part of it (nuclear program)," the AEOI spokesman said. Kamalvandi added that enemies believe that Iran should not have the nuclear industry at all and that is why they try to make it look like Tehran is pursuing goals other than the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The current crisis over Iran’s nuclear program was created in May 2018, when former U.S. president Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and imposed tough economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic under what he called the “maximum pressure” policy. The talks to salvage the agreement kicked off in the Austrian capital of Vienna in April last year, months after Joe Biden succeeded Trump, with the intention of examining Washington’s seriousness in rejoining the deal and removing anti-Iran sanctions. Despite notable progress, the U.S. indecisiveness and procrastination caused multiple interruptions in the marathon talks. In his phone talks with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Friday night, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian thanked the EU’s chief diplomat for encouraging all negotiating parties to return to their commitments under the JCPOA. Amir Abdollahian also said despite “contradictory” remarks by the American media outlets now the steps to restore the nuclear agreement are on the “right track” and in line with this policy “we welcomed cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency on technical course.” While in New York for the annual UN conference, Amir Abdollahian held fruitful talks with foreign dignitaries, including his counterparts, on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. Last month, Iran’s nuclear chief Mohammed Eslami also visited Vienna for the annual IAEA conference where he held talks with IAEA director general Rafael Grossi. At their meeting, Eslami and Grossi agreed on new cooperation.       All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
