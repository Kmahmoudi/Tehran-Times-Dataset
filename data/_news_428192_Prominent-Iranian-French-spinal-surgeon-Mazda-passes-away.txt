TEHRAN — The world-renowned Iranian-French pediatric spinal surgeon professor Keyvan Mazda, who was a philanthropic and famous for performing successful complicated surgeries, passed away on Wednesday. He was 69. Professor Mazda was born in 1949 in the Iranian city of Abadan.  He performed many free of charge surgeries on underprivileged children. He had started his collaboration with Zanjireh Omid (literally meaning Chain of Hope) International Charity Institute in 2007 and came to Iran to visit and conduct surgeries on children four times a year.  On his last trip to Iran in the previous Iranian calendar month (ended September 22), he and his surgical team performed surgeries on 28 children. Zanjireh Omid International Charity Institute was founded on June 26, 2007. The main goal of this institute is to provide medical and therapeutic services to underprivileged children suffering from cardiac, orthopedic and reconstructive diseases.  This institute has close scientific cooperation with the international charity institute La Chaîne de l’Espoir (Chain of Hope) - France, which was founded by Prof. Alain Deloche in 1998 and has branches in 16 countries all over the world. Zanjireh Omid Institute treats underprivileged children under 18 who live in Iran regardless of religion, race and nationality by using the best medical facilities based on the international standards. Dr. Deloche said on Tuesday that “Keyvan Mazda passed away. He was a great pediatric orthopedic surgeon. He was one of my students and a close friend, and he was a part of my life and I travelled around the world with him,” egora.fr wrote in French on Thursday.  "We are deeply saddened by the news of professor Mazda's passing. His contribution to pediatrics and orthopedics will be remembered,” the general director of Zanjireh Omid, Maryam Marashi said following hearing the news of his sudden death on Wednesday.  "On my own behalf and on behalf of Zanjireh Omid staff, I extend my deepest condolences to Prof. Mazda's bereaved family and loved ones."   Marashi described Prof. Mazda's passing away as a great loss and stated "La Chaîne de l'Espoir lost a leader who had dedicated his life for the health of innocent children. In fact, he devoted his entire life to patients with spine conditions and made significant contributions to promoting orthopedic pediatrics in Iran. Dr. Mazda touched so many lives, not just at Zanjireh Omid Charity Institute, but also worldwide with his philanthropy. He was truly a great man. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family." On its twitter account on Thursday, the French embassy in Tehran also expressed condolences over the sorrowful death of professor Mazda.   MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
