1 metr moraba, which literally means one square meter, is an eco-friendly campaign which was launched on Instagram in August 2016.

 The page, with over 1300 followers and more than 110 posts, invited the followers to clean one square meter of the nature, which is polluted with plastics and trashes, and take a picture before and after their action. “The only aim of the page is to save the nature from pollution and to establish a movement for not dropping litter in the nature… As citizens without any affiliation to state-run organization, we are seeking to clean the nature and we ask you to help us with your photos and efforts to have a clean surrounding,” the page’s administrator says. Iranian actor Ramin Nasser-Nassir, actresses Shohreh Soltani and Gelareh Abbasi and TV anchor and director Mansour Zabetian are amongst the page’s famous followers.
