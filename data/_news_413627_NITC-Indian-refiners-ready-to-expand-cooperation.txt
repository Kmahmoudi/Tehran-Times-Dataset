TEHRAN- National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) Managing Director Sirous Kianersi said that in his meeting with Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan he has announced NITC’s readiness for the continuous and safe shipment of Indian refineries’ products. “While emphasizing the significance and history of Iran-India relations, Pradhan, for his part, voiced the preparedness of his country’s refineries and oil companies to broaden cooperation with NITC”, Shana reported quoting Kianersi as saying.
Soon after the implementation of Iran’s nuclear deal known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in January 2016, the official announced his company’s determination for a strong return to the European markets and also adding new countries to the list of its customers while it was preparing its fleet to achieve this goal.
In early January, he announced that NITC has leased out 30 oil tankers to foreign companies since JCPOA.
“Our priority is the shipment of Iranian oil to the export markets and additional tankers will be leased out”, the official added.
NITC, which operates the largest tanker fleet in the Middle East and has the world’s largest fleet of super tankers, transports Iranian crude and also acts as an independent entity in contracts with foreign concerns for crude oil transportation based on prevailing international freight rates.
