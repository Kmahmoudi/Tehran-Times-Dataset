TEHRAN - Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani has said that Iran’s missile program cannot be weakened under foreign pressure, noting the indigenous defense program will continue powerfully.
 “Today Iran’s indigenized defense power, and specially the missile power which is the result of the experience gained during the Sacred Defense (Iraqi-imposed war 1980-1988) years, can neither be weakened nor restricted given its national identity,” Fars news agency quoted Shamkhani as saying while addressing university students in the western province of Kurdistan on Monday evening. “The plans to enhance the country’s defense capacities will powerfully continue to confront the threats without attention to the foreign pressures and as a necessity in the national security area,” the top security official stated.
