The event, to be held November 3-12 in Istanbul, is the 11th international auto expo in Turkey coordinated by the Organisation Internationale Des Constructeurs d'Automobiles (OICA). The yet-to-be exported Samand had its first debut in 2004 show in Turkey and its pavilion was visited by Turkish PM Tayyip Erdogan. Nevertheless, the sale in this neighboring country is still marred with ‘trade and commerce’ problems. The Turkish MYS is in charge of marketing Samand in Turkey. Over 100 different models by 36 auto manufacturers will be exhibited in this 10-day event and over half a million people is anticipated to visit the expo. Sponsored by OICA, the auto show is now listed in the calendar of important international car events held in Geneva, Paris, Tokyo and Frankfurt.
