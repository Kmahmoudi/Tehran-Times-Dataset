TEHRAN – Anatoly Antonov, the ambassador of Russia to the United States, on Thursday voiced support for the Iran nuclear deal, referring to Tehran’s commitment to its obligations under the deal. “It is worth mentioning that the (International Atomic Energy Agency),” the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations, “has no complaints about Iran’s compliance,” he said, according to Sputnik. The 2015 nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was struck between Iran and six world powers – the U.S., UK, Russia, France, China, and Germany. He also said the JCPOA resolved one of the biggest international issues and its steady implementation solves mutual interests.
