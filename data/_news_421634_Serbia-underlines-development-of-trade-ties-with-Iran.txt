TEHRAN- Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic in a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif called for expansion of Tehran-Belgrade trade ties, the portal of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) reported. The Serbian minister expressed his country's keenness to strengthen all-out relations with Iran, particularly in trade and economic fields underscoring that the two countries’ value of bilateral trade stood at $20 million in previous year, which is not satisfactory. Zarif, for his part, named oil, gas, petrochemicals, mines, agriculture and IT as some areas appropriate for expansion of ties between the two countries. Heading a politico-economic delegation, comprised of Iranian entrepreneurs from ICCIMA and the chamber’s Head Masoud Khansari, the Iranian minister arrived in Belgrade on Monday at the first step of a four-nation tour of East Europe i.e. Serbia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
