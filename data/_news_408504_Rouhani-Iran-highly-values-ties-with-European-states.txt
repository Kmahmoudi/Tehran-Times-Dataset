TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that Iran prioritizes ties with European countries and is determined to develop cooperation with them. He made the remarks after a meeting with visiting Slovenian President Borut Pahor in Tehran on Tuesday. Rouhani underscored the importance of mutual cooperation between Iran and Slovenia, adding that the Islamic Republic is determined to “develop ties with friendly countries, especially European states.” He said the two sides discussed various issues concerning the Middle East and the world. Rouhani described the visit of Pahor to Tehran as an important episode in Iran-Slovenia relations. Heading a high-profile politico-economic delegation, Pahor arrived in Tehran late on Monday to confer with senior Iranian officials on political and economic relations. He is accompanied by the ministers for economy and foreign affairs, as well as a large business delegation, according to the Slovenian president’s office. ‘Slovenia to reopen embassy in Iran’ Rouhani also announced that Slovenia will reopen it embassy in Tehran on Wednesday, after nearly three years of closure. Emphasizing the importance of strengthening bilateral ties, he said Iran and Slovenia share common interests in different matters. The Slovenian president also said the reopening of embassy in Tehran shows his country’s determination to develop multilateral relations with the Islamic Republic. Back in March 2013, Slovenian foreign ministry announced that the country decided to shrink its diplomatic network, and close its embassy in Tehran as part of general austerity. Iran, Slovenia sign three MOUs Iran and Slovenia signed three memoranda of understanding to expand cooperation in the areas of economy, telecommunication, and nanotechnology. “The normalization of relations between Iran and the international community has provided Slovenia with a second opportunity to improve its ties with the Islamic Republic to a normal level,” Pahor said in an indirect reference to the nuclear deal between Iran and great powers which removes the lifting of economic sanctions on Iran. He further said that there are “no obstacles to the expansion of relations between the two countries”.  Pahor also said the two countries share common views on many international issues. ‘Nuclear deal is a sign of successful diplomacy’ Elsewhere in his remarks, the Slovenian president lauded Iran for its commitment to the nuclear deal, and called on all sides to fulfill their obligations under the international agreement. “The nuclear deal is a clear signal that all international conflicts can be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue,” he noted.
