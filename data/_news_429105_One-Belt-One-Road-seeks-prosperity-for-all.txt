BOAO, HAINAN PROVINCE, CHINA -- The Chinese People's Daily hosted the 2018 Media Cooperation Forum on Belt and Road Media Forum on Oct. 29-30 in the city of Boao, Hainan Province. Over 200 people, including journalists and entrepreneurs, participated in the conference. Senior journalists from all corners of the world were present, from Mexico, Argentina and Canada in South and North America up to Southernmost Easternmost countries in Asia.    The most important theme of the conference is to promote economic, cultural and civilizational interactions among the nations along the ancient Silk Road which today is called One Belt One Road or Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI was first proposed by Chinese President Xi in 2013. Keynote speeches were made by Ji Bingxuan, one of the Vice Chairmen of China’s Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Hainan's vice governor Wang Ku. Mr. Ji, who was addressing the forum under the title of "Contribution by All Benefits for All", said the revitalization of the Silk Road is to bring "prosperity" and "connectivity" between nations. Li Baoshan, the president of People's Daily, another lecturer at the forum, said it is true that BRI has been proposed by China but Beijing's policy is not to put "China first". Mr. Li said, "We should put aside prejudices against the initiative and revive ancient history." All other dignitaries insisted on achieving "common prosperity". Hainan pilot free trade zone  Mr. Wang elaborated on pilot free trade zone in Hainan Province which he serves as vice governor. He said under the master plan Hainan is set to become the largest free trade zone among other 11 FTZs in China. According to the decision by top Chinese authorities, Hainan is set to become the largest hub of international tourism, healthcare, research, education, modern technology, foreign banks, and foreign investment in the country. Gifted by natural beauties, the island province of Hainan is now the window of opportunity in China. As the only tropical island province, it has distinctive tourism resources. It is home to more than 4000 plant species, of which 2000 can be used as herbal medicine. It is also habitat for wild animals including black bear and clouded leopard. Mr. Wang said it is planned to make Hainan the best FTZ in the country by providing all financial, maritime, and aerial services.  Invitation to establish consulate in Hainan The vice governor went on to invite foreign countries to establish consulate in the tropical island province.
