TEHRAN – Iranian parliamentarians have drawn up a motion to counter U.S. President Donald Trump’s anti-Iran rhetoric and his threat to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 group. Lawmaker Hossein-Ali Hajideligani told Tasnim news agency on Tuesday that the motion is being prepared and its final version will be submitted to the Parliament’s presiding board next week. The motion includes a series of measures to deal with the Trump Administration’s possible actions on the nuclear deal, he added.
