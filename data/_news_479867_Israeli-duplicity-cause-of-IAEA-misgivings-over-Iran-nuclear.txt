TEHRAN - In an effort to resolve lingering difficulties, the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) by authorizing its technical team to inspect certain nuclear facilities. But the Iranians are fully aware that the IAEA's uncertainties stem from the lies and swindles of the Israeli regime. A month after the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution against Iran, technical inspectors from the agency are visiting Iran to look into the purported claims highlighted in the resolution and other issues regarding the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, IRNA reported on Sunday.  Mohammad Eslami, the chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), announced on Wednesday that an IAEA team will soon come to Tehran to assist in removing the alleged barriers and moving on to address the remaining safeguards issues. The IAEA's technical team paid a visit to Iran on December 18 at Tehran's official invitation. The visit was applauded, but Mikhail Ivanovich Ulyanov, Russia's Permanent Representative to International Organizations in Vienna, stressed that no one should anticipate any breakthroughs from the visit. Until recently, the Islamic Republic's high degree of cooperation with the IAEA was acknowledged in every report released by the UN nuclear watchdog. However, due to the Zionist regime's grip on the IAEA, those encouraging reports progressively went away.  Resolutions against Tehran over the last year have been based on claims such as "undeclared nuclear items" in "multiple undisclosed places in Iran." Iran is accused by the IAEA of not upholding its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). However, findings by the UN nuclear agency show that the Islamic Republic has continuously cooperated with the UN body. The IAEA Board of Governors' latest allegation is that Iran's unofficial sites may contain traces of radioactive materials. The locations identified by the agency, including Torghuzabad, Shian, and Marivan, are precisely those that Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized in 2018. The Iranian government has often emphasized that there hasn't been any nuclear activity in those places. Additionally, the state has repeatedly reaffirmed that it has never conducted any form of secret uranium enrichment program. The technical team from the IAEA will travel at a time that the U.S. and its allies are accusing Iran of refusing to work with the nuclear watchdog. The fact that Iran permitted the visit, however, speaks volumes about Tehran's actual cooperation with the IAEA. For the visit to be successful and fruitful, the IAEA must be sincere in its desire to settle any unresolved concerns with Iran.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
