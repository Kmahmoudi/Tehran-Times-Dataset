TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Saturday summoned the British ambassador to Tehran to express the Islamic Republic’s protest over relentless attempts by the London-based Persian-language television networks to incite deadly riots that have erupted in several cities in Iran. The ambassador Simon Shercliff was summoned by the Foreign Ministry department for Western Europe, the ministry announced. The BBC Persian and Iran International have been using all their energy in recent days to provoke violent protests that erupted in Iran over the death of a young woman, who died at hospital three days after collapsing at a police station in Tehran. The 22-year-old woman, named Mahsa Amini, was arrested in Tehran by morality police to educate her on Islamic dress code. Amini, from the Kurdish city of Saqez, died on September 16. The ministry went on to say that a strongly-worded note of protest was conveyed to the British ambassador that his country is hosting such networks, Press TV said. Such behaviors are instance of interference in Iran’s internal affairs and considered moves against national sovereignty, the ministry added. The British ambassador said that he will immediately convey the matter to the officials of his country. The Norwegian Ambassador to Tehran, Sigvald Hauge, was also summoned to explain the “interventionist stance” of the country's President of the Storting (the supreme legislature) Masud Gharahkhani on Iran's domestic affairs.
