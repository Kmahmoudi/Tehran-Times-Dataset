TEHRAN – Tehran on Monday criticized U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for using a misnomer to refer to the “Persian Gulf”, asking him to increase his knowledge of history.

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Monday said all U.S. statesmen know what the real name of the Persian Gulf is. “Tillerson has a background in the field of oil [business], and given the background that American politicians have, the name ‘Persian Gulf’ is known to all of them,” Qassemi stated.
