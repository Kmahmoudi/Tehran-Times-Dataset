TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that Europe has not taken enough practical actions to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 Europe’s political determination should be accompanied by practical actions, Zarif told Young Journalists Club in an interview published on Sunday. “From our viewpoint, Europe’s actions are adopting position rather than practical acts,” the chief diplomat remarked.  He noted that Iran has announced its expectations and Europeans have taken a number of actions, but their acts have not been enough. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran.  The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on Monday, August 6. The second batch will be restored on November 4. ‘Move beyond words’ In similar remarks on August 15, Zarif said Europe has so far lived up to its commitments, but they have to “move beyond words". "The Europeans say the JCPOA is a security achievement for them. Well, you ought to pay for your security. No one finds security without investment," Zarif pointed out. Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, responded on August 7 to the Iran sanctions by calling on companies to disregard threats from Washington. “If there is one piece of international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation that is delivering, it has to be maintained. We are encouraging small and medium enterprises, in particular, to increase business with and in Iran as part of something (that) for us is a security priority,” she said. Back in July, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that a package proposed by the European Union trio of Germany, France and Britain on how to save the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran was “disappointing”.
