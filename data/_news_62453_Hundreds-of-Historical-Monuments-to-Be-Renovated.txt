Renovation operations on these monuments, which are located all over the country, have been under way since 1999. Akbar Taqizadeh-Asl, the director of the project, said that since the monuments are manifestations of ancient Iranian architecture and cultural values, they are considered to be tourist paradises, and for this reason they are named Pardis. He said that the original names of the monuments will be used beside the name "Pardis". According to the Public Relations Department of the Cultural Heritage Organization, some 32 historical monuments have been identified and are currently being renovated. The department added that three ancient monuments have also been identified in the central desert which will be renovated this year. As for the reason for the choice of location, Taqizadeh said that a large number of foreign tourists, especially those interested in the environment, enjoy visiting the desert. Bahram Palace and Ein-ul-Rashid Caravansary in Varamin, Maranjab Caravansary in Aran and Bidgol are among the selected monuments in the central desert.
