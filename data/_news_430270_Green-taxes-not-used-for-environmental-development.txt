TEHRAN – While the Municipality of Tehran receives green taxes paid by pollutant industries, the money is not used for developing the environment or improving the industries, Ali Moridi, head of department of environment’s (DOE) soil and water office has said. The DOE is trying to revise the law and receive green taxes to use it toward eradicating air and water pollution, wastewater treatment and environmental issues, along with technology and industries improvement, he said, IRNA reported on Tuesday. Referring to proper laws adopted on waste management, he stated that there are rules which obliges the waste management affairs of the DOE to make the manufacturing and import industries pay taxes and spend the taxes on waste management and recycling. “Accordingly, if industries do not produce contaminated or hazardous waste, they will be subjected to tax exemptions,” he added. He went on to note that under these rules, industries which not manage their wastewater properly and cause water and soil pollution will be fined. “To solve the problem, we must try to change all industries into the environmentally friendly industry, which can be fulfilled in cooperation with the industries as well as the universities,” he concluded.
