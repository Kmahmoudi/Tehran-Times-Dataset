TEHRAN – Austrian Finance Minister Hans Jorg Schelling and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif held talks in Tehran on Sunday as the sides expressed interest to expand ties.
 Zarif said Iran has established stronger banking ties with Austria in comparison to other European countries. There have been good advances in relations between the two countries especially after the historic agreement over the Iranian nuclear program, Zarif explained.   The nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was brokered in Vienna, the Austrian capital, on July 14, 2015 between Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany and the European Union. The landmark deal, which entails the termination of economic and financial sanctions against Iran in return for a curb on Tehran’s nuclear work, went into effect in January 2016. ‘Collective cooperation’ needed to fight terrorism Elsewhere, Iran’s chief diplomat said Takfiri terrorism is a threat against all countries in the Middle East region, renewing Tehran’s call that a “collective cooperation” is required to counter the scourge of terrorism. For his part, Schelling expressed regret over Wednesday’s terrorist attacks in Tehran and said that terrorism is source of concern for the entire world. In two simultaneous terrorist attacks on the administrative building of Iran’s Majlis and the shrine of Imam Khomeini in Tehran, 17 people were killed and 52 injured. Daesh claimed responsibility for the attacks. The Austrian minister said the extremist groups’ actions have nothing to do with religions. Schelling who had visited Tehran with an accompanying team said that his visit to Iran was aimed at deepening relations, especially in economic area. During Schelling’s visit to Iran Austria allocated a credit line of €1 billion for a major steel production project in southern Iran. NA/PA
