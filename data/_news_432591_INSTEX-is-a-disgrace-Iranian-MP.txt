TEHRAN – A member of the Majlis presiding board said on Saturday that INSTEX is in fact a disgrace on the Iranian nation and “it is not clear until when the administration wants to continue this disgrace.” The conditions set out by Europe as it established INSTEX are in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal and Iran’s national independence, Mehr quoted Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi as saying. “The Westerners have become conditional toward Iran,” he said, adding that they exploit the Rouhani administration’s weak spot with regard to the nuclear deal in order to put more pressure on Iran.
