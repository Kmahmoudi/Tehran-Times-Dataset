TEHRAN – It is well past time for foreign aggressors to end their airstrikes and crimes against humanity, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday, referring to the Saudi-led military campaign against Yemen. “Iran welcomes initial agreements between Yemeni parties in Stockholm under supervision of UNSG envoy, and strongly supports continuation of talks to achieve final accords on all issues. It is well past time for foreign aggressors to end their airstrikes & crimes against humanity,” Zarif said in a tweet. The UN-brokered peace talks between the warring parties in Yemen’s conflict began on Thursday in Sweden.
