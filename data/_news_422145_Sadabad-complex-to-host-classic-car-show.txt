TEHRAN – A classic car show will open its doors to the public at Tehran’s Sadabad Cultural-Historical Complex on March 22. The show will include over 60 privately-owned vintage cars and motorcycles dating back to 45 years ago or earlier, Mehr reported. Touring & Automobile Club of the Islamic Republic of Iran will organize the event, which will be running through April 18. Sprawled on about 110 hectares of a mountainside parkland in northern Tehran, the Sadabad Cultural-Historical Complex is used to be a royal summer residence during the Qajar era (1789–1925) and subsequent Pahlavi epoch (1925–1979).
