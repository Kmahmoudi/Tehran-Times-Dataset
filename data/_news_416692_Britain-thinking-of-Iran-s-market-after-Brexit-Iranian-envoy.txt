TEHRAN- In a meeting with Chairman of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) Gholam-Hossein Shafeie, Iran’s Ambassador to London Hamid Baeidinejad said that since Britain is due to leave the EU, it is looking for new markets including Iran’s lucrative one.  Time is now ripe for developing mutual cooperation considering Britain’s tendency for collaborating with Iranians and the available wide range of areas for cooperation, the portal of ICCIMA reported on Sunday quoting Baeidinejad. Informing that an Iran-Britain joint conference will be held in near future in London, the ambassador invited Shafeie to attend the event. ICCIMA chairman, for his turn, noted that under the support and efforts of Iranian Foreign Ministry a constructive cooperation between the private sectors of Iran and Britain has been formed, which is unprecedented during the past 30 years. He also announced that an Iranian trade delegation will leave Tehran for London in this Iranian calendar year’s eleventh month of Bahman (January 21-February 19, 2018) to take part in a business forum with their British counterparts.
