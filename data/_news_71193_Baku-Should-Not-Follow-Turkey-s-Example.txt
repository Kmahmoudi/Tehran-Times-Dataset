the Zionist regime's spy network against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The latest edition of the daily ********Musavat Novin********** claimed that Iran is continuing its military threat against Azerbaijan Republic and suggested that Baku should establish links with Tel Aviv and receive intelligence and military aid from Israel in order to counter what it called threat posed by Iran. The daily seemed to be encouraging the Azeri government to follow the example set by Turkey and submit to the influence and expansionist policies of the Zionist entity. Turkey was forced to open its doors to Israel under pressure from Turkish army generals, despite Turkish people's opposition to such relations and their anti-Zionist feelings. Consequently, Turkey has turned into a regional base for the Zionist regime. Now, some pro-U.S. and pro-Zionist circles in Azerbaijan Republic and their affiliated publications are encouraging the Azeri government to submit to the influence of the Zionist entity and compromise its national interests. However, to justify their demand, they are claiming that Iran poses a threat to this republic. It is also possible that the Azeris have not been able to achieve self-confidence ever since the collapse of the former Soviet Union and feel in need of support from the United States and the Zionist regime. But even if this is the case, they should realize that Iran is ready to have friendly relations and cooperation based on mutual respect and interests with all its neighbors, including the Azerbaijan Republic. Political wisdom requires the Azeri politicians not to turn their country into a regional base of the aliens like the United States or Israel, which are after their own interests.
