TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossein Jaberi Ansari condemned on Saturday the Canadian court’s ruling which orders seizure of Iran’s assets under the pretext of Iran’s involvement in terrorist acts. “According to the news, Ontario’s Supreme Court issued a political ruling, based on unfounded claims of Iran’s support for the terrorist groups, and approved seizure of $13 million of Iran’s assets. This action is on the path of former extremist government of Canada which was brought down by people,” he said. The ruling comes as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government seeks to renew diplomatic ties with Iran. He said that the Canadian government’s action runs contrary to its claim about normalization of relations. Normalizing diplomatic ties between the two countries requires the Canadian government to review its former “wrong and extremist” policies, he added. Jaberi Ansari dismissed the ruling, noting that the Canadian government is responsible for protecting Iran’s assets.
 
He also said Tehran reserves its right to take necessary measures to uphold its rights. Canada severed its diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012, citing no clear reason for it.  NA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
