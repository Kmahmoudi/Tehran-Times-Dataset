TEHRAN – Iran’s missile attack on terrorists in response to the Ahvaz attack showed the country’s military might in the fight against terrorism, President of Russia’s Academy for Geopolitical Problems Leonid Ivashov said on Tuesday. Speaking to IRNA, Ivashov, who is a retired colonel general, said Iran is a “powerful player” that can “change the regional and international equations.” Calling Iran’s strategy to block the way on terrorists in the Middle East “a model to follow”, the Russian general blasted the role of some countries in the region for supporting terrorist groups.
