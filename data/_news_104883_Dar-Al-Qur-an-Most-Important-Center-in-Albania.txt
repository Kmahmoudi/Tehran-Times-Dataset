In an interview with the Mehr News Agency, he said a group of four people select four different interpretations in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and English and translate them into Albanian; the most fluent one is taken as the Albanian version. In fact, it is a kind of translation and interpretation. The group is called the Holy Qur’an Interpretation Association while the accepted interpretations in Albania are Soyouti from Egypt, Kashshaf in Arabic and Ibn-Kathir. “The Qur’anic sciences are not taught in Albanian schools,” he added. Such courses are taught merely at few specific schools. If you are fortunate you may find just one such school in a city.” Asked whether the Albanian government has established any particular equipment to complete the teachings of such sciences, he said, “No, nothing in particular; it merely tries to defuse tensions among religions and various factions and bring them closer to each other.” He further said that besides Sa’di of Shiraz Institution which is active in expanding Iranian culture and civilization in Albania, there is another one namely Dar al-Qur’an which strives to teach Qur’anic sciences. It holds annual competitions in Albania in line with Qur’anic cultural development. It also has a museum on writing Qur’an in Albania with a great value for the Muslims of this country. “Iran is bringing Muslims closer to each other through holding such competitions, know more about their cultures and their problems,” he concluded.
