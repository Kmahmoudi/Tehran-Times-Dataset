TEHRAN – The access problem of Telegram messaging app, which was not available since the early hours of Sunday, was solved in Iran and other countries later in the day. Telegram is a cloud-based instant messaging service developed by Telegram Messenger LLP, a privately held company registered in London, United Kingdom, founded by the Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov. “Massive overheating in one of the Telegram server clusters may cause some connection issues for European users within the next couple of hours. Apologies for the inconvenience – the problem is being solved,” Telegram CEO Pavel Durov said earlier.
