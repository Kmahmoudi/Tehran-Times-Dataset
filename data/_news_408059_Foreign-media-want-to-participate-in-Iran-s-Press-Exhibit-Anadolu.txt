 By Manijeh Rezapoor  TEHRAN -- The representative of the Anadolu Agency, a state-run press agency in Turkey, Mustafa Melih Ahishali, says that the foreign media would like to have their pavilions at Iran’ Press Exhibit. Speaking to the Tehran Times on Sunday at the 22nd Press Exhibition underway at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Mosalla, he said, “I think many foreign media working here in Iran would like to have their own stands at this exhibition.” Asked if they have officially proposed their request, he replied, “There has been some discussion. There used to be some pavilions for the foreign media in previous editions of the exhibit, however here, there are none. “The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has provided a good opportunity at this exhibit for foreign media, and several sessions have been arranged at the foreign media department. This will allow the Iranian press and news agencies to become familiar with the foreign media active in the country,” he explained. “For example, last year I became acquainted with almost 32 agencies. We sat down and held talks,” he remarked. Melih Ahishali called the press exhibit an absolute necessity and said, “Journalists working for the press and news agencies are gathered in one location and we can communicate with them easily, and elaborate on their works. We can sit and hold talks and can find out which agencies are active in Iran.” On the positive outcome of the exhibit, he also said, “I think it gives us a chance to become more familiar with Iranian media.” To the question asked if there is any such exhibit in Turkey, he said that the press have pavilions at the book fairs, but he does not think there is a separate exhibit for the press. “The press need to have their own exhibit. They should be seen separately,” he said and referred to Iran’s press exhibit, which was part of Tehran’s International Book Fair for many years. The exhibit will run through November 11.
