TEHRAN – Hamid Mohammadi, the new head of Iran's Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization, on Sunday dismissed reports that Saudi Arabia has invited Iran to discuss a resumption of Iranians' participation in Hajj pilgrimage. “Contrary to the report published by some media outlets regarding an invitation by Saudi Arabia for Iran’s participation in this year’s Hajj rituals, we have received no invitation,” Mohammadi said. The official expressed optimism that Iranians would be able to participate in the annual rituals “like people from all Muslim countries.” He added that the organization is doing all in its power to reestablish Hajj pilgrimage for Iranian citizens. “Definitely, if our conditions regarding the dignity and security of the Iranian pilgrims are met, participation of Iranian pilgrims [in Hajj] would be possible,” Mohammadi noted. Also on Sunday, an Iranian lawmaker welcomed a resumption of Iranians' participation in Hajj pilgrimage, urging Riyadh to take required measures so that Iranians would be able to attend Hajj rituals. “If Riyadh accepts responsibility, we would welcome the reopening of Hajj so that eager people can partake in the rituals,” said Mohammad Ali Pourmokhtar. He also urged Iranian officials to set preconditions for Iran’s participation in this year’s Hajj rituals. MH/PA
