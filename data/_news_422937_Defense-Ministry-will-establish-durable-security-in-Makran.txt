TEHRAN – Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Monday his ministry is resolved to establish “sustainable security” in Makran, a stretch of coast southeast of Iran emerging as a major naval base and a hub of maritime trade. Addressing a ceremony arranged to sign a contract on the construction of a pipeline between the southeastern cities of Chabahar and Iranshahr, Brigadier General Hatami said the military has assumed the responsibility to develop the Makran Coasts. “The government has taken very valuable measures to develop Makran in order to activate the region’s latent potentials,” Hatami was quoted by Mehr as saying.
