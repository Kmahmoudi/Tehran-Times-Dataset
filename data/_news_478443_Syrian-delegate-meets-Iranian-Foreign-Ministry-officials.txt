Last week, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Faisal Mekdad, paid a visit to Tehran, where he met with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir Abdollahian. The two ministers discussed issues of mutual interest, especially economic, commercial and tourism cooperation, as well as some regional and international issues. The Iranian foreign minister emphasized the common positions of the two countries in various regional and international fields. He stated that both countries have agreed to hold a joint high commission on economic cooperation in Tehran in the near future hosted by Iranian First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, with Syrian Prime Minister Hussein Arnous in attendance. The top Iranian diplomat also touched on the one-day meeting of the Group of Friends for the Defense of the UN Charter, which was held in Tehran on Saturday with the participation of 18 countries at the level of deputy foreign ministers. Meanwhile, Mekdad highlighted the solidarity and friendship between Iran and Syria against foreign interventionist measures, saying, “These measures are taken with the aim of targeting the stability of Iran and the region.” The Syrian foreign minister expressed satisfaction that perpetrators of anti-Iran actions and their financial and media supporters failed. He welcomed the meeting of the Group of Friends for the Defense of the UN Charter and added: “The world’s dominant pole has used the United Nations Charter for its own interests and it has pushed the charter away from its true goals.” The Syrian foreign minister also supported Iran’s position in the nuclear negotiations and expressed hope that the Western countries would stop their dishonest positions in the process.
