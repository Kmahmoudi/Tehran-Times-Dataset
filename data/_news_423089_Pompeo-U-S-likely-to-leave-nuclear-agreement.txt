New U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that President Donald Trump will likely withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal.
 “The President has been clear -- absent a substantial fix, absent overcoming the shortcomings, the flaws of the deal -- he is unlikely to stay in that deal past this May,” CNN quoted Pompeo as telling reporters during a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Trump has said he will make a decision on whether to leave the deal by May 12. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
