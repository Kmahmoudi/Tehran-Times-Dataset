TEHRAN- A permanent exhibition of Iranian products including foodstuff, garments and handicrafts kicked off at Moscow Food City (the largest wholesale food distribution center in Russia), IRNA reported on Sunday. Some 50 Iranian companies are taking part in the exhibit, which is aimed at promoting presence of Iranian traders and businessmen in the neighboring country.
As exporters and importers from other countries especially those from Central Asia are also doing business at Moscow Food City, the exhibit provides some proper opportunity for the Iranian traders to find business partners.
