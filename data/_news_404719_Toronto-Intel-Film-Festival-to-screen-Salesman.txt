TEHRAN – Iranian director and writer Asghar Farhadi’s latest blockbuster “Salesman” will go on screen in the special presentations section of the 41st Toronto International Film Festival, which will be held in the Canadian city from September 8 to 18.  The social media scooped the awards for best screenplay by Farhadi and best actor, won by Shahab Hosseini, at the 69th Cannes Film Festival.  Early in July, the film also won the ARRI/Osram Award at the Munich International Film Festival. “Salesman” is about Emad (Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidusti) who move into a new flat in the center of Tehran. An incident linked to the previous tenant dramatically changes the young couple’s life.
