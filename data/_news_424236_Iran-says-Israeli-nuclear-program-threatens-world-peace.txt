TEHRAN – Iran’s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency has told the IAEA Board of Governors in Vienna that Israel’s nuclear program poses threat to international peace and security. Speaking at the board’s quarterly meeting on Thursday, Reza Najafi said Israel’s nuclear capabilities should be put on the IAEA agenda as a real threat to the regional and international peace and security, Press TV reported. The regime’s nuclear capabilities must be deemed a threat until Tel Aviv joins the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) unconditionally and all the regime’s clandestine nuclear facilities are placed under the UN agency’s Safeguards, he added.   MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
