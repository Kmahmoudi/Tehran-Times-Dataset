All of the students of an advertising class were in for a big surprise as they walked into their classroom on Thursday afternoon. Some undergrad pupils at Soore University in Tehran delivered a class presentation that went above and beyond any oneâ€™s expectation. The aroma of burning incense sticks in the class was just enough to take you to the deep jungles of northern Iran. A couple of oil lamps were hanging off the ceiling while a couple of long tangerine branches, of course with tangerines still on them, was wrapped around the lamps giving it an exotic look. A beautiful table was set in the middle of the room with variety of simple organic foods, from free-range eggs to homemade bread and yogurt, organic olives and walnuts to local spices and cookies all in either hand-woven baskets, attributed to northern of Iran, or traditional Iranian pottery plates. The presenter certainly looked the part in her beautiful, native, red velvet outfit. As she presented the topic, Native Advertising, there was plenty of time for the remaining students to nibble on the simple fare. The presentation was accompanied by variety of pictures and short clips to power it up, giving it a more concrete and evidence-based foundation while making it more interesting for the audience. A question was thrown in to stimulate students thinking and grab their attention and the one who gave the right answer was awarded with a prize. In the end, the group received a warm round of applause and was offered a final exam exemption, a well-deserved call by the professor. You cannot ever go wrong with going beyond your call of duty, be it as a student or as an employee, as the reward will come along with it.
