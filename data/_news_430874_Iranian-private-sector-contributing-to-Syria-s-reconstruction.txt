TEHRAN – Iranian private sector has started cooperation with Syria in order to rebuild the country’s war-damaged infrastructures, ILNA reported on Wednesday quoting Iranian deputy minister of roads and urban development. According to Amir Amini, Iranian investors and enterprises are eager to play a key role in Syria’s potential $600-billion worth of projects. “The Iranian government is not going to allocate any resources to the reconstruction projects but it will guarantee the investments through the Central Bank of Iran (CBI),” Amini said. He further noted that the Iranian private sector is already investing in different areas like providing construction materials especially cement. "There are good investment opportunities in Syria, and the only problem is that the channels of communication between the investors and the Syrian government are not strong enough,” he added. Earlier in August, a delegation comprised of Iranian economic experts traveled to Syria to explore investment opportunities and finalize the reconstruction plans of the war-stricken country. Many urban areas across Syria, particularly around Damascus, have been hard-hit by war, and President Bashar Assad said this month that rebuilding would be his “top priority”.
