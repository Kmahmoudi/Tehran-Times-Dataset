TEHRAN — Six metropolises of Isfahan, Bushehr, Bandar Abbas, Shiraz, Kerman, and Mashhad and 289 other cities in Iran are currently troubled with water stress, deputy energy minister said on Friday. “The amount of water consumption is roughly equal to the amount of water stored in these cities,” IRNA news agency quoted Rahim Meydani as saying. Mentioning water storage level in dams, Meydani explained that for the time being the water storage level in dams are quite satisfying nationwide.  However, in such conditions the consumers should efficiently manage their water consumption, especially during peak hours, Meydani added. From 4.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends are peak periods of water consumption, he highlighted. He went on to say that “Water consumption is pretty high during the aforesaid hours.” As forecasted by Iran Meteorological Organization the temperature is expected to rise 0.5 to 1.5 centigrade in the [Iranian Calendar] months of Tir, Mordad and Shahrivar falling on (June 22 to September 22) which would certainly result in high water consumption, he said, adding, “to maximize efficiency try to avoid consuming much water in peak periods and putting off affairs needing water until off-peak periods.” With the beginning of the summer and concurrent with national water saving week in Iran (June 22-28) the consumers are presented with water management and efficiency techniques for 10 percent reduction in drinking water consumption.
