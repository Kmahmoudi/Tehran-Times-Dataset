TEHRAN – The Jewish representative in Iran’s parliament scolded the Israeli regime on Tuesday for pursuing what he called “fascist ideas,” branding its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a “psychic vampire.” “The fascist and racist ideas of the heads of the occupying regime of Israel have paved the way for their disgrace,” Siamak Moresedgh was quoted as saying in his parliamentary speech. “The Israeli prime minister is a psychic vampire who is neck deep in crime and has played no role but poisoning the atmosphere, slaughtering innocent children and women, and cruelly occupying the lands of the Palestinian people.” Moresedgh was the leader of the Tehran Jewish Committee, a group that supports synagogues, schools and other facets of Jewish life in Iran. He has been representing the Jewish community in the parliament since 2008. His comments come after Netanyahu, in a meeting with Russian President Putin in Moscow on Friday, claimed that “Persia made an attempt to destroy the Jewish people that did not succeed nearly 2,500 years ago, today there is an attempt by Persia’s heir, Iran, to destroy the state of the Jews.” The Iranians freed the Jews from the Babylonian captivity in the 5th century B.C., a second time in the dark middle ages, and a third during the Second World War, Moresedgh counter-argued.
Earlier, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif rejected Netanyahu’s tirade, saying the Israeli prime minister was resorting to “fake history and falsifying the Torah.” Also, Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani reacted to the remarks, highlighting that Netanyahu has distorted the Iranians’ pre-Islam historical era and attempted to misrepresent events. “Of course, nothing more than presenting such lies is expected from a wicked Zionist,” Larijani pointed out.
