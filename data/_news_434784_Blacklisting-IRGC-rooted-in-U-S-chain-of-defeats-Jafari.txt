TEHRAN - Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Chief Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari has said the terrorist designation against the forces under his command by the Trump administration is rooted in Washington’s “chain of defeats” in the Middle East region.
 The move is the result of hatred and anger from the defeats that this “Pharaonic” regime has suffered at the hands of the IRGC, he said in a message on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump labeled the IRGC as terrorist organization on April 8. Immediately after the announcement, the Iranian Supreme National Security Council named the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) a terrorist organization, and the U.S. government a sponsor of terror. Jafari described Trump’s action as “stupid” and “illegal”. He also praised the people and officials for their support to the IRGC. President Hassan Rouhani said on April 10 that the U.S. is aware of the consequences if it takes more steps than “slogans” against the IRGC. Iranian lawmakers uniformly appeared on the Majlis floor on April 9, wearing outfits of the IRGC in a move to show contempt for the U.S. move. All MPs, including Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani and presiding board members, participated in the collective move. Jafari said the act showed national integrity and unity which is the key of success in countering challenges.
