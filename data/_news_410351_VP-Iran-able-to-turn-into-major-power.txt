TEHRAN - Vice President Is’haq Jahangiri said on Monday that Iran is capable to turn into an international major power in economic and political areas.
 “Iran can turn into one of the major international powers in economic and political areas through relying on cultural, economic and political capacities,” he said during an international conference on investment opportunities and sustainable development in Chabahar, a city of shores of the Sea of Oman. On the sidelines of the conference seven memorandums of understanding were signed with Korean, Chinese, Omani and Indian companies to develop the Mokran coastal region.  The vice president said that Iran has an important status due to its access to international waters. He also said, “Leader of the Islamic Revolution and the ‘government of prudence and hope’ pay lots of attention to development of the Mokran coastal region.” A special emphasis has been put on development of the Mokran region in the sixth development plan, Jahangiri remarked, adding officials should speed up development of the coastal region. He said involvement of domestic and foreign investors in underprivileged areas is very important.  The vice president also suggested that economic development should not cause any harm to the environment.
