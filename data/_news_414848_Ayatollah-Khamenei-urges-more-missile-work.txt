TEHRAN – Receiving a group to Revolutionary Guards officers on Wednesday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pushed for strengthening missile capabilities. “Do work on missiles to the extent you can. Look how sensitive the enemy is to the missile issue,” the Leader told the top officers. “The enemy should be slapped.” The Leader also referred to the recent missile attack at Islamic State’s strongholds in Syria, saying, “You did excellent job.” Ayatollah Khamenei praises IRGC missile attack on ISIS as “excellent job”. The firing of six missiles into Islamic State’s strongholds in eastern Syria on June 18 by IRGC left dozens of terrorists killed and injured. The swift avenge came after ISIS suicide bombers and gunmen stormed the parliament and the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini on June 7, killing 18 and injuring at least 56.   PA/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
