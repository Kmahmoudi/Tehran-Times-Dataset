TEHRAN — Over a thousand and a half houses have been inaugurated for the families with two or more physically challenged members, labor ministry’s caretaker has said. “Some 1,573 families having two or more members with disabilities under the Welfare Organization’s coverage have been given houses,” Tasnim quoted Anoushirvan Mohseni-Bandpey as saying. Out of 1,573 free housing units, 217 have been inaugurated in the province of Lorestan, 201 in Kerman, 160 in South Khorasan, 132 in Fars, 118 in Khorasan Razavi, 113 in Kordestan, 107 in North Khorasan, and the rest in other provinces of the country, he explained. “A total budget of 106 billion rials (nearly $2.4 million) has been allocated for the construction of housing units,” he stated, adding that some 390 billion rials (about $8.8 million) has been earmarked for granting house loans. The government has taken many measures to provide medium living conditions for underprivileged people, he concluded. Majlis [the Iranian parliament] approved both general outlines and details of a bill on rights of persons with disabilities on January 2018. Development of disability-friendly cities, free transportation, health insurance, free education, job creation, housing loans, and less working hours are some of the articles of the law which are hoped to improve such groups’ living conditions in the near future.
