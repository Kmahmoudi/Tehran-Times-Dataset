TEHRAN – The Iranian director of headquarters for the fight against narcotics, Eskandar Momeni, has urged Azerbaijani officials to respect the public opinion and its people and to see the position of Iran in the fight against narcotics trafficking. Despite the cruel sanctions, our efforts to combat drug trafficking have intensified and we call on other countries to cooperate in this regard, he emphasized. Momeni’s remarks came after Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev claimed that Iran is helping Armenia to smuggle drugs to Europe, without producing any proof of his allegations.  “After restoring its 130-kilometer border with Iran, which was under Armenian control for 30 years, Azerbaijan stopped the illegal trafficking of narcotics from Iran to Armenia and on to Europe through Azerbaijan’s Jebrail district,” Aliyev claimed during a virtual summit of former Soviet republics. "The volume of heroin we seized in other border areas of Azerbaijan-Iran has doubled compared to last year, which shows that over the past 30 years, Armenia and Iran have been cooperating with each other in the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan for drug trafficking to Europe.” Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian denied the allegations raised by the Azeri president when he addressed the summit from Yerevan. 90% of opium discoveries by Iran Iran is the leading country in the fight against narcotics worldwide; despite its proximity to Afghanistan, which is the largest producer of narcotics.
