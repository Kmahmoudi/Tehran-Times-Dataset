For most people, the spring season is associated with flowers, green earth and blue sky. In Iran, the New Year Celebration, Noruz, is the exact astronomical beginning of the spring.  Haft Seen, an arrangement of seven symbolic items, which start with ‘S’ in Persian language, is a custom which is being observed by almost all Iranians worldwide.  Sabzeh, wheat, barley, mung bean or lentil sprouts growing in a dish, is one of the items of Haft Seen, which are prepared weeks ago by Iranian families.    Hyacinth flower as well as gold fish, colorful eggs, Holy Quran, candles, and mirror, are some additional items, which are put on Haft Seen.  Here you can find about some flowers, which bring springs to your homes.  Hyacinth flower, reminder of Noruz Many Iranians put hyacinth flower on their Haft Seen table in Noruz. According to the flower expert website, hyacinths are spring-flowering bulbs with long, narrow leaves that are folded lengthwise. They are highly fragrant flowers that bloom in dense clusters.  The plant flowers one to two weeks in spring. Many of us put it away after that period but after the plant has finished flowering, we can cut back flower stalks but allow the leaves to die back naturally, hiding the unsightly foliage with annual or perennial plantings.  It needs bright place. Keep the potting media lightly wet, but not soaked. Keep it cool during the growing season to prolong the bloom.   Colorful tulips Tulip is also a great choice for bringing spring to your home. This beautiful spring flower grows best in areas with cold winters and dry summers. However you can bring this beautiful sign of spring to your home in a pot and keep them after its flowering is finished. Be careful not to overwater the plant and keep it next to a sunny window. If your bulbs have to sit in water, they are more likely to rot. Don’t use bark to create extra drainage. Place the bark at the bottom of the container, which will allow air to flow under the soil and prevent rotting. Geranium and Persian houses For many Iranians, the flower is reminder of grandma’s houses with a big yard and a pool in the middle decorated with geranium pots. Its fragrance and color is reminder of childhood and old Iranian houses. Spring is a great chance to bring all those sweet reminding to your home. According to thespruce.com, geraniums need lots of direct sums to bloom well, so let them soak up those rays by placing them on the south side of walls, on tabletops or as an accent in sunny areas of the garden. If you notice that your plant has stopped blooming in summer, don’t panic! They have a tendency to stop blooming during hot weather, so try placing it where it will receive some afternoon shade if you live in a hot climate. To keep geraniums in bloom, remove spent flower stalks periodically. To keep plants bushy, full and packed with flowers, pinch out new growth occasionally by pruning the tips of each stem with sharp, clean pruners.  SB/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
