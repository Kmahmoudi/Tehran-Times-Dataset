TEHRAN – Iran’s nuclear chief says the Islamic Republic is not “bluffing” when it says it is ready to resume twenty-percent uranium enrichment at the Fordow nuclear facility in case the remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear deal fail to abide by the accord, Press TV reported on Thursday. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the official name for the nuclear agreement, Iran accepted to put confidence-building curbs on its nuclear program, but they do not obstruct the “peaceful activities of Iran’s nuclear industry”, said Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI). “The enrichment is currently underway, but we would put aside the 300kg limit [set by the nuclear agreement] whenever we wish, and would do the enrichment at any volume and level,” Salehi said in an interview with the national TV on the sidelines of a visit to the Fordow facility. “We currently have 1044 centrifuges in Fordow, and if the establishment wants, we will restart 20-percent uranium enrichment in Fordow.”  He expressed hope that the remaining parties to the nuclear agreement would deliver on their promise and implement their commitments in order to fill the gap created by the U.S. after its unilateral withdrawal from the pact. Otherwise, he said, Iran will have to reduce its JCPOA commitments. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
