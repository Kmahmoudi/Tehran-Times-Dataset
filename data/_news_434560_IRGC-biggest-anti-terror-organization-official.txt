 “The Guards, as the biggest anti-terrorist organization, has had the most successful performance in the fight against terrorism and the outcomes of its work has led to calm for regional nations,” IRNA on Wednesday quoted Ashna as saying. Ashna said the United States is not just trying to harm the IRGC, the Iranian armed forces and the Islamic Republic of Iran, but the main target is the nation of the Islamic Iran.
