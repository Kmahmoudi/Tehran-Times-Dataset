Using an exclusive method, the company can produce 2,000 units of probiotics each month, which can meet the needs of factories for their raw material.” In comparison with foreign rivals, the domestically-produced product has a more reasonable price and a higher quality, he said.

Introduced early in the 20th century, the science of probiotics has advanced considerably, especially in the past two decades. In the global marketplace, probiotics are found primarily in three main categories – foods, dietary supplements, and pharmaceuticals. The regulatory category of some newer products containing probiotics is unclear. The quality of probiotic products, including reliability and accuracy of product labeling, can vary considerably amongst the product category and geographical regions.
