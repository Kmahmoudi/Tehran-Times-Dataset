Addressing the opening ceremony of the seminar at the Energy Research Center, Deputy Minister of Energy and Managing Director of the Power Generation and Transmission Organization (TAVANIR) Mohammad Ahmadian, said that the seminar has been organized jointly by more than 100 universities as well as domestic and foreign scientific, research and industrial institutes. He said that over 700 articles were submitted to the secretariat of the seminar by experts from Iran, Germany, Azerbaijan, Australia, Jordan, UK, Slovenia, the U.S., Brazil, Pakistan, Japan, Switzerland, France, Canada, South Korea, Libya, Egypt, Iceland and Belgium, out of which 240 articles were selected and published. "National and foreign experts, professors and officials in charge of the industry will attend the three-day conference to exchange views and discuss issues on electricity," he added. Addressing the opening ceremony of the seminar, Minister of Energy, Habibollah Bitaraf, announced the production share of Iran's thermal, compound cycle, gas, hydro- and diesel power plants at 52, 25, 14 and 7.2 percent respectively. "In line with environmental anti-pollution measures, as of mid-2001 setting up hydro-electric power plants has been given priority," he said. "Given that power plants with higher thermal efficiencies are of great significance, the development of compound cycle power plants and making the steam section of the current gas plants has been included in the ministry's agenda," he added. Bitaraf said that the steam section of six compound cycle power plants have, meanwhile, been completed to this effect. According to the minister, the constructions of seven new compound cycle power plants are also underway, IRNA reported. He stated that the ministry's policy on the development of power production in the nation's third development plan is based on hydroelectric and compound cycle power plants. The minister said, "The first high power gas turbine production plant in the Middle East has been implemented in Iran." One hundred percent of Iran's urban population and 96 percent of the rural residents currently have access to electricity and the nation's power subscribers currently stand at 17 million. thr 062 iran-electricity     /eco/     int'l electricity seminar opens tehran, oct 28, irna -- the 17th international electricity seminar aimed at providing grounds for research, exchange of views and negotiation for the experts, researchers and authorities involved in the industry opened here on monday. addressing the opening ceremony of the seminar at the energy research center, deputy minister of energy and managing director of the power generation and transmission organization (tavanir) mohammad ahmadian, said that the seminar has been organized jointly by more than 100 universities as well as domestic and foreign scientific, research and industrial institutes. he said that over 700 articles were submitted to the secretariat of the seminar by experts from iran, germany, azerbaijan, australia, jordan, uk, slovenia, the us, brazil, pakistan, japan, switzerland, france, canada, south korea, libya, egypt, iceland and belgium, out of which 240 articles were selected and published.

"in line with environmental anti-pollution measures, as of mid-2001 setting up hydro-electric power plants has been given priority," he said. "given that power plants with higher thermal efficiencies are of great significance, the development of compound cycle power plants and making the steam section of the current gas plants has been included in the ministry's agenda," he added. bitaraf said that the steam section of six compound cycle power plants have, meanwhile, been completed to this effect. according to the minister, the construction of seven new compound cycle power plants are also underway. he stated that the ministry's policy on the development of power production in the nation's third development plan is based on hydro-electric and compound cycle power plants.     the minister said, "the first high power gas turbine production plant in the middle east has been implemented in iran." one hundred percent of iran's urban population and 96 percent of the rural residents currently have access to electricity and the nation's power subscribers currently stand at 17 million.
