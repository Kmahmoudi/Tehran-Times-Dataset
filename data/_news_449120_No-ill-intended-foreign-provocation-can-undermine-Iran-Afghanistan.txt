Iran slams U.S. for lecturing about rights of refugees In another tweet, the Iranian Foreign Ministry slammed the United States for lecturing about rights of refugees while it is building a wall along the border with Mexico to prevent migrants. The ministry said the Trump administration has been widely condemned for its cruel border policies. “Look who’s talking about the rights of refugees! A government whose campaign motto was to ‘build a wall’ and has been repeatedly condemned for its cruel border policies (e. g. separating migrant children from their parents), is lecturing the world about #WorldRefugeeDay,” the ministry said in the tweet. The tweet came as a response to a tweet by U.S. Assistant Secretary Robert A. Destro claiming, “Horrified by accounts of Afghan migrants and refugees being drowned, shot, and burned alive by Iranian border guards and Iranian police. Those responsible must be held accountable.
