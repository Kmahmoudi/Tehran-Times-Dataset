TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said despite a lot of noise from Washington over the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, it was the U.S. and not Iran that its foreign policy ended in failure.

 “Except the illegitimate Zionist regime and one or two countries in the region that follow America, nobody in the world has supported America,” Zarif said on the sidelines of his meeting with lawmakers in the Majlis on Monday. “This shows that despite all the noise that the Americans have made, it was our foreign policy which turn out successful. And it was their foreign policy which was defeated. It is because one day Mr. Trump makes a speech, and the next day Mr. Pompeo makes an (opposite) speech. Yet the next day they form the (Iran) action group. These things they are doing all show that their policies have failed.” “We had formed a special committee at the Supreme National Security Council secretariat to deal with American actions before America did [the same]. This committee has performed well. This is why we see the Americans tried for 1.5 years to force Iran out of the JCPOA, to violate the JCPOA so that the Americans could have a procedure to justify their act.” “They finally failed and were forced, against their primary policy, to quit the JCPOA unilaterally and in fact stand against the world community.” SP/PA    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
