TEHRAN- Iranian and Belarussian industry ministers signed eight cooperation documents in various economic sectors, IRIB news reported on Wednesday. The documents were inked by Belarusian Industry Minister Vitali Vouk and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Shariatmadari at the end of the 14th meeting of Iran-Belarus Joint Economic Committee which was held in Tehran on January 22 and 23. Among the penned documents is the one on preparation of cooperation roadmap between the two countries from 2018 to 2020, which includes collaboration on different sectors such as politics, economy, trade, investments, banking, agriculture, transportation science, and culture. The other documents are on transfer of knowledge, production and exports of medicine to Belarus, joint manufacturing of trolleybuses, buses and trucks, establishment of production lines of Iranian cars Dena and Dena Plus in Belarus, and expansion of Iran’s technical and engineering services to Belarus.   “The signed documents between the two sides are valuable and the held meeting is a new round of mutual cooperation. As accorded in the meeting, the two countries will make required efforts to finance implementation of the agreed projects,” Shariatmadari said. “The common banking cooperation does not stand at a satisfactory level and a banking cooperation roadmap must be prepared to fortify banking ties between Tehran and Minsk,” he added. Expressing hope about the implementation of the signed documents, Vouk called them an introduction to a wide range of bilateral agreements that will be signed in the presence of the Belarussian president in Tehran in near future.   HJ/MA  PHOTO: Belarusian Industry Minister Vitali Vouk (L) and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Shariatmadari signing cooperation documents in Tehran All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
