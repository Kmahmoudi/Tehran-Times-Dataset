TEHRAN - Iran’s atomic energy chief has unveiled his country’s new nuclear agenda, saying Tehran is considering potential partners in addition to Russia to develop small modular reactors. “We have not entered into serious negotiations with any country with regard to SMR's but this is our strategy. So, we are working on it and making the assessment as to whether it is feasible for us and then we will look around and see which countries are willing to cooperate with us in the development of SMRs,” said Ali Akbar Salehi in an interview with Sputnik on Friday. A type of nuclear fission reactor, small modular reactors are smaller than their conventional prototypes manufactured at a plant and brought to a site to be fully constructed.  A main function of the small unit is to provide electricity for remote areas or regions with smaller electric grids. 
Earlier, Salehi told delegates at the World Nuclear Association (WNA) symposium in London that Iran intends to increase its nuclear electricity production from its current 1000MW of electricity to 30,000MW.
A week ago, Iran began building its second and third nuclear power plants with each plant producing 1,057 megawatts of electricity with the Russian Rosatom.
The new power plants are expected to come online in a decade with an investment of nearly $10 billion. MH/AK
