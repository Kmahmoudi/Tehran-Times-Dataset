TEHRAN- Some 27 trillion rials (above $639.8 million) of budget has been paid in cash to implementation of development projects during the first three months of the present Iranian calendar year (started on March 21, 2018), IRNA quoted Iranian deputy finance minister as saying on Tuesday. The paid amount is twice more than that paid in the same period in the preceding Iranian year, Rahmatollah Karami said.
