TEHRAN – Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani on Saturday called for sustained efforts to expose the brutal nature of the Israeli regime and its atrocities against the Palestinians to garner stronger support for the Palestinian cause, Mehr reported. “The Zionist regime’s criminal measures should be exposed to the world … This awareness raising will help boost support for the Palestinian cause,” Larijani said in a meeting with a Palestinian parliamentary delegation. He underscored Iran’s continued support for Palestine, saying it is the duty of every honorable human being to lend a helping hand to the oppressed Palestinian people. “I hope all countries in the region and the world would strengthen their support for Palestine, so this movement becomes stronger,” he remarked. For his part, Mahmoud al-Zahar, the head of the Palestinian delegation, said the issue of Palestine unifies the world’s freedom fighters. He thanked the Islamic Republic for its support of the Palestinian people, saying Iran’s efforts to prevent the passing of anti-Palestinian resolutions is admirable. At the end of the meeting, Al-Zahar, who is also the co-founder of Hamas and a member of the Hamas leadership in Gaza, invited Larijani to visit the Gaza Strip.
