TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday that “baseless accusations” and “repeated scenarios” will not help the Bahraini government to reduce friction with its own people.
 “Once again, we advise the Bahraini officials to provide the grounds for interaction and negotiation with its people instead of intensifying security approaches,” Qassemi said in a statement. His comments came as the Bahraini Interior Ministry issued a statement on Saturday, accusing Iran of supporting armed network to plot attacks on Bahraini officials and security forces. According to Reuters, Bahrain claimed that it had rounded up 116 members of an armed network established and supported by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, suspected of plotting attacks on Bahraini government officials and security forces. The Interior Ministry in Bahrain claimed that investigators found sites used by the militants to manufacture and store explosives intended to be used for “terrorist attacks”. The ruling Bahrain family has stifled opposition voices with the help of Saudi Arabia. It has imprisoned hundreds of pro-democracy activists and handed down capital punishment against some of them.   NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
