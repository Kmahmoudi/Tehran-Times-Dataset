TERHRAN- Iranian Privatization Organization (IPO) is to transfer 19 trillion rials (about $452 million) worth of the state-run shares to the private sector on January 8, 2018, IRNA reported on Friday.
 According to IPO’s Spokesman Ja’far Sobhani, the offered shares belong to 25 state-run companies. The Iranian government has envisioned a large privatization program in the Fifth Five-Year National Development Plan (2010-2015), aiming to privatize about 20 percent of the state-owned firms each year. Under the present interpretation of the Article 44 of Iran's Constitution, hundreds of state-owned companies have been privatized. HJ/MA
