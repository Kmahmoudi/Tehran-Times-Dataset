TEHRAN- After a meeting at the White House on Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement that part of it made accusations against Iran. Biden and Macron said Washington and Paris are committed to bar Iran to build what they called nuclear weapons. They also expressed solidarity for the unrest in Iran. Since the outbreak of the insurgency in Iran, Western nations have been backing unrest under the tutelage of Washington. They also continued leveling accusations on Iran by saying, “France and the U.S. will cooperate with their allies to implement the anti-Iranian resolution of the IAEA board of governors.” The Israeli regime and the United States have been making unsubstantiated claims that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons. Iran has vehemently refuted such allegations and highlighted that as a signatory to the NPT, it is entitled to use nuclear technology for civilian purposes.  International Atomic Energy Agency's inspectors have paid numerous visits to Iran's nuclear sites, but they have never discovered any proof that the country's nuclear energy program has been diverted to weapons program.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
