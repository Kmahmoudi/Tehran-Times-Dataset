TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday congratulated the Iraqi people and government for their bravery in succeeding to fully liberate the city of Mosul from the hands of Daesh. “Congratulations to brave people & Government of Iraq upon liberation of Mosul. When Iraqis join hands, no limits to what they can achieve,” Zarif tweeted. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, dressed in a military uniform, arrived in Mosul on Sunday to congratulate armed forces for wresting the city from Daesh, also called ISIS or ISIL. The victory marked the formal end of a fierce campaign that lasted nearly nine months and left much of Iraq’s second-largest city in ruins. Top Iranian military officials, including Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri, have also sent congratulations to Iraqi military and political officials on victory over Daesh.
