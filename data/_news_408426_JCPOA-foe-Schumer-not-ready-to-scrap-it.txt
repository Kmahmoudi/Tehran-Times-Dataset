TEHRAN – Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader and JCPOA-critic, says he is not ready for scrapping the Iran nuclear deal. Schumer said another year or two is needed to assess whether the pact is working. Schumer told Politico in an interview published on Saturday while he remains “skeptical” of the agreement, “it would be wrong to repeal it now.” “I’m willing to try. I think the jury’s still out, and I’m willing to wait another year or two,” he said. SP/PA
