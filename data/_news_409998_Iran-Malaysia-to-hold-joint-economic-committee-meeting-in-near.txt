Mentioning the seminar of “Trade with Iran” which was held on Thursday in the Southeast Asian country, Afkham expressed hope that such events would promote exports and also boost foreign investment in the country. According to the official, both countries are willing to boost bilateral economic ties in post-sanctions era. Earlier in October, Iranian Communications and Information Technology Minister Mahmoud Vaezi, who is also the co-chairman of Iran-Malaysia Joint Economic Committee, said that it is expected that the value of trade between the two countries will increase five-fold over the next two years. In a meeting with Mustapa Mohamed, Malaysia’s minister of international trade and industry who is also Iran-Malaysia Joint Economic Committee's new co-chairman, Vaezi said bilateral trade relations were very good but fell short due to the unjust sanctions over the past years.
