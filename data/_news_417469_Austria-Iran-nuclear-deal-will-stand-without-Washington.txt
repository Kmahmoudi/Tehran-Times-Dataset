TEHRAN – Jan Kickert, Austria’s permanent representative to the UN, said in a Tuesday-published interview with IRNA that the Iran nuclear deal will continue to stand even if Washington withdraws from it. Kickert denounced as “wrong and unjustifiable” a possible move by the current U.S. administration to “decertify” Iran’s compliance with the deal, officially known as the JCPOA. He also said his country believed that Tehran has lived up to its commitments under the JCPOA, urging the other sides to honor their obligations as well.
