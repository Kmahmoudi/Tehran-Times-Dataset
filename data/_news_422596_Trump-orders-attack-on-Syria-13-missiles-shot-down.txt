Multiple places in Syria came under attack by U.S., British and French military forces after President Donald Trump ordered a military strike against the war-torn country in support of terrorists, however Syria succeeded to shoot down 13 missiles.
 Trump announced on Friday that he was ordering to "launch precision strikes on Syria". The Syrian state TV reported that air strikes targeted Damascus and surrounding areas. Syrian military were responding to the air strikes with anti-aircraft weapons. U.S. officials told reporters that the strike involved Tomahawk cruise missiles.The British Defense Ministry said that four RAF tornado jets also took part in the strike. Syria reported that "Syrian air defense blocks American, British, French aggression on Syria." It added that 13 missiles were shot down. The Pentagon said the full operation was completed in less than 60 minutes.  The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) claimed three main chemical weapons-related sites and a command center were targeted.  U.S. Defense Secretary General James Mattis said air strikes will not take place, unless the Syrian President Beshar al-Assad uses chemical weapons again. These targets were decided on with the goal of minimizing impact on Russian forces and civilians, according to the JCS. U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford said the deconfliction line with Russia was "active" this week. The U.S. Central Command followed normal protocols when communicating across the deconfliction channel with Russia for clearing the airspace, JCS said.  "This wave of strikes is over," Dunford emphasized. When asked how many missiles were intercepted, Dunford said simply, "I don't know," before stating that the central command would have more details over the weekend.  Dunford told reporters that the United States does not know about any Russian defense systems engaged in airstrikes on Syria.  "I am not aware of any Russian activity."
