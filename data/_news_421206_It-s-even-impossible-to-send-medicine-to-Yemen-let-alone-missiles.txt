TEHRAN – Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani on Monday rejected U.S. allegations that Iran had supplied missiles to Yemen, saying even sending medicine to Yemen is impossible under the Saudi blockade, let alone missiles. “These claims are new plots, which of course will again be foiled by the people,” Amoli Larijani was quoted by Fars as saying. On December 14, 2017, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley presented what she claimed were parts of an Iranian-made ballistic missile fired from Yemen at Saudi Arabia. She claimed the “evidence” proved Iran’s violation of UN resolutions banning the transfer of weapons to the Houthi Ansarullah fighters.
