TEHRAN - As the trade war between China and U.S. escalates, there is a likelihood of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meeting in Vietnam, according to reports. The presidents of China and the U.S. are considering meeting in the coastal city of Da Nang on February 27 and 28, according to a report in South China Morning Post. Quoting a source, the report says Jinping and Trump are expected to continue pushing to resolve the trade dispute between the two nations, which threatens to affect global trade. The 90-day trade war truce between the two trade rivals ends March 2. That’s the deadline U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has set to increase tariffs on a number of Chinese imports if there is no progress in trade talks this month. Trump has complained incessantly about the yawning trade gap between the two countries. The trade deficit with China widened again last year According to experts, there is less likelihood of the high-profile meeting producing any breakthrough as far as resolving the trade war between the two countries is concerned. China would refuse to accept a compromise formula that shows them as a weaker party of the two. It is widely believed that China seeks to displace U.S. as the world’s sole ‘super power’. The recent tension between the two countries, particularly the trade war and military escalations have put the spotlight back on their great rivalry.
