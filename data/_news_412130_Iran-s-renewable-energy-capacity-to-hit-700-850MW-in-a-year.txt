TEHRAN- Iran’s renewable energy generation capacity will reach 700-850 megawatts (MW) in the current Iranian calendar year (which began on March 21), Seyed Mohammad Sadeqzadeh, the deputy energy minister, announced. The official said that wind and solar farms will account for about 90 percent of the mentioned capacity, Mehr news agency reported. Late in February, Sadeqzadeh, who is the managing director of Renewable Energy Organization of Iran (known as SUNA), announced that the country’s total installed capacity of renewable power plants has exceeded 340 MW, ILNA reported. For the time being, supplying five percent of the country’s electricity need from renewable energies is a priority for Iran’s energy industry but 10 or even 20 percent would be out of consideration. After the removal of the West-imposed sanction against Iran foreign companies have been flocking to the country to contribute to its renewable energy sector. German company EAB NEW ENERGY GMBH, South Korea’s KTC co., and some leading companies from Denmark, Hungary, Turkey, as well as China are just a few of the companies interested in Iran’s energy sector.
