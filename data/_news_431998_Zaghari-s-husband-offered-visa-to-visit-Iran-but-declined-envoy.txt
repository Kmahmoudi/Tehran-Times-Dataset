TEHRAN – Tehran’s ambassador to the UK said on Thursday that Iran had offered Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband a visa to visit Iran but he did not use the opportunity. “Pursuant to numerous requests to visit the family, we offered Ms. Zaghari's husband a visa in April 2017 to visit Iran--to see her and especially to be with his daughter. That was almost two years ago,” Hamid Baeidinejad said in a tweet. “You'd have to ask him why he did not use this opportunity to visit the family,” he added. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, has been imprisoned in Iran for 2 years on charges of trying to orchestrate a soft overthrow of the Islamic Republic.
