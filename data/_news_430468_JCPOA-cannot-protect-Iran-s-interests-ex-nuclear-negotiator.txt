TEHRAN – Iran’s former chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said on Sunday the 2015 nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is not an agreement that can protect Iran’s interests, Mehr reported. “Barjam (Persian acronym for the JCPOA) is not a strong structure as some had claimed,” said Jalili, an outspoken critic of the JCPOA, which was clinched under his 2013 presidential election rival, Hassan Rouhani. He said the Europeans, despite being present at the nuclear negotiations, failed to condemn U.S. withdrawal from the deal back in May. “The Europeans are seeking to salvage Barjam at the expense of the Iranian nation, but this dream will not come true,” Jalili remarked. Criticizing Washington’s sanctions against Iran, the former negotiator said the U.S. knows that its options to counter the Iranian nation is further restricted day by day. He added, “It is because of Trump’s stupidity that he uses this tool (sanctions) yet again.” Jalili also criticized the idea of entering new rounds of negotiations with the U.S., saying, “Today, certain individuals want to set aside the ideals while spouting fictional and romantic slogans. For instance they say if you continue negotiations with America, Trump will grant you significant concessions.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
