TEHRAN – Iranian MPs said on Tuesday that the Majlis will take decision which befits the Islamic Republic of Iran against the U.S. actions.
 The MPs made the remarks in a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei following the U.S. act in designating the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. Iranian lawmakers on Tuesday uniformly appeared on the Majlis floor wearing outfits of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps in a move to show contempt for the United States’ move a day earlier to name the armed forces terrorist. All MPs, including Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani and presiding board members, participated in the collective move. Addressing the MPs, Larijani said, “Majlis condemns this shameful act of the heads of the U.S. regime and supports the IRGC.” He noted that the U.S. act shows the “depth of its hatred and stupidity”. “It is the U.S. government that should account for creating and supporting the terrorist groups and not the Guards,” he said. He added that the IRGC has “broken the back” of the terrorists in the region who had set the region on fire. “The Guards’ endeavors against terrorists are something that cannot be concealed,” added Larijani who served as an IRGC officer in the early years of the Islamic Revolution. Elsewhere, Larijani said that this act of the U.S. government shows its “frustration” and not its power.  He added that it is an honor for the Iranian people to support the IRGC.
