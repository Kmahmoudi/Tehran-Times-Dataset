TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday that Iran, Turkey and Azerbaijan have common stance on regional issues and are determined to cooperate.
 “Tehran, Ankara and Baku’s cooperation in developing the region, improving the living standards and also boosting peace and security in the region, which is facing many challenges, is very important,” he said during a joint press conference with Mevlut Cavusoglu and Elmar Mammadyarov, the Turkish and Azeri foreign ministers, in Istanbul. Zarif said that regional problems should be solved through peaceful ways and based on the international law. He also said that the three countries have many capacities to expand cooperation in various spheres. He also praised Turkey and Azerbaijan for supporting the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, after the U.S. withdrawal in May. ‘Turkey to continue cooperation with Iran despite U.S. sanctions’ Cavusoglu said that Turkey will continue cooperation with Iran despite U.S. sanctions. He said that Ankara is holding consultations with the European countries to find ways to continue cooperation with Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump reintroduced sanctions on Iran in August. The second wave of sanctions, which targets Iran’s oil exports and central bank, is due to start in early November. ‘Baku to expand relations with Tehran, Ankara in transportation’ Mammadyarov said that Baku seeks to expand relations with Tehran, Ankara in area of transportation. Zarif was in Istanbul to attend sixth trilateral meeting to discuss matters of common interest. EU’s mechanisms to be operated in few days, Zarif says Upon arrival in Istanbul, Zarif said that the European Union’s mechanisms to allow countries to transact with Iran while avoiding U.S. sanctions will be operated in few days. On September 25, European Union foreign policy chief Mogherini announced that the bloc was creating a new payment mechanism to allow countries to transact with Iran while avoiding U.S. sanctions. Zarif noted that the U.S. will not reach its economic and political objectives. The mechanism, a so-called special purpose vehicle (SPV), is designed to circumvent the sanctions, under which Washington can cut off any bank that facilitates oil transactions with Iran.
