TEHRAN- The capacity of generating electricity from renewable resources in Iran will reach 1100 megawatts (MW) by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019), IRIB reported. “With the new 450 MW of under-construction power plants being added to the current capacity, the capacity of renewable power plants this year will reach 1100 MW,” Seyyed Mohammad Sadeqzadeh, head of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (known as SATBA) said. According to the official, so far, 100 trillion rials (about $2.38 billion) has been invested in Iran’s renewable energy sector, half of which has been supplied by the private sector and half by foreign investors. Renewables, including hydropower, account for just six percent of energy generation, versus natural gas’ 90 percent share. Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence in the regional electricity market. According to SATBA the number of small scale solar power plants across the country which are used by households or small industries is being increased noticeably as Iranian households and small industries have embraced the new technology with open arms and investors also seem eager for more contribution in this area.
