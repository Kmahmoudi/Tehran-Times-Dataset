TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that there is a strong consensus that Iran is complying with the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 Zarif made the remarks after meetings with foreign ministers of Germany, Britain and France and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in Brussels on Thursday.
 
“Strong consensus in Brussels today: 1) Iran is complying with JCPOA, 2) Iranian people have every right to all its dividends, 3) any move that undermines JCPOA is unacceptable. E3 and EU fully aware that Iran’s continued compliance conditioned on full compliance by the U.S.,” Zarif tweeted. The tweet by the chief diplomat came one day before U.S. President Donald Trump declared his new policy toward the nuclear agreement. On October 13, Trump refused to certify Iran’s compliance to the nuclear deal and asked Congress to decide about the fate of the deal. However, Congress passed the ball back to Trump by letting the deadline on reimposing sanctions on Iran pass. Trump was scheduled to announce his decision on Friday. Prior to leaving Brussels for Tehran on Thursday, Zarif said that the international community will counter any move which is against full implementation of the nuclear deal. “It is essential for all, especially the U.S., to remain committed to the JCPOA and implement it in order for Iran to remain committed to the JCPOA,” he said.  NA/PA
