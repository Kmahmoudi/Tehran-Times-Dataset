TEHRAN — UN-Habitat, the United Nations program working towards a better urban future, is ready to offer Iran closer cooperation via its office in Tehran. The executive director of UN-Habitat Joan Clos said cooperation on creating opportunities and educational issues between UN-Habitat and Iran can be improved via UN-Habitat office in Tehran. Clos made the remarks in a meeting with Iranian transport minister Abbas Akhoundi on the sidelines of the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, Habitat III, which took place in Quito, Ecuador, October 17 to 20. Akhoundi, for his part, pointed that Habitat III and adopting new resolutions for urban management are of key importance and taking them into consideration in policy making and urban planning are pretty vital both at national and local level, IRIB reported on Wednesday. “Habitat III” is shorthand for a major global summit, formally known as the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development. The United Nations has called the conference, the third in a series that began in 1976, to “reinvigorate” the global political commitment to the sustainable development of towns, cities and other human settlements, both rural and urban.
