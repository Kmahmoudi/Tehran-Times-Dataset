“Several meetings are being held in order to choose one of the two cities,” the director of the Historical Monuments Preservation and Renovation Research Center said. “The plan was previously proposed at the 9th International Conference on the Study and Conservation of Earthen Architecture held in Iran in 2003, where it was warmly welcomed by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM)” Abdorrasul Vatandust added. Meibod officials have suggested a 60-year-old mud brick military base used by British forces during World War II to house the center. Experts believe that the establishment of such a center would provide a good opportunity to reinforce Iran’s mud brick monuments.
