Donald Trump is to decide today whether to keep the United States in the multilateral nuclear accord, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 No matter what decision he would take, Trump has already ruined the reputation and credibility of the United States by repeatedly attacking the nuclear agreement, which has been endorsed by the UN Security Council and backed by the entire international community. Trump, a real estate magnate, who has even overgeneralized his transactional view to international conventions and laws, sees the nuclear agreement as a commodity rather than as an internationally binding agreement. His approach toward the JCPOA has been a mockery of the world and international law. He has used the harshest language against the JCPOA, calling it “horrible”, “worst” “laughable”, etc. All these rash remarks are taking place despite the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency - the international body responsible under the terms of the deal for certifying Iranian compliance – has confirmed in each quarterly report that Tehran has been fully living up to its commitments. In addition, under the JCPOA, Iran’s nuclear program is subject to the most robust monitoring, verification, and inspection regime in modern history. "We have the strongest verification regime in Iran," IAEA chief Yukiya Amano has said. Amano has also said, “We are doing our job impartially, objectively and factually.” Iran has also agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to the IAEA Safeguards Agreement which will continue forever. Today anybody with a little bit of mind is advising against the abrogation of the agreement. However, Trump and other headstrong people like Mike Pompeo, Nikki Haley, Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton are pushing for a withdrawal from the agreement. Of course, Trump has two other loyalists outside the United States who desperately wish a killing of the nuclear deal, one is Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the other is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Trump, who has got different nicknames such as “racist-in-chief”, “liar-in-chief”, “king of chaos” and “saboteur-in-chief”, has so far dealt a great blow to the reputation of America in the world and is somehow pushing the world toward anarchy and lawlessness and fueling radicalism.
