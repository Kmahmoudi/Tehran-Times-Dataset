TEHRAN – The second phase of Iran’s Persian Gulf Star Refinery (PGSR), which was inaugurated by President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday, adds 12 million liters of Euro-5 quality gasoline to the country’s total output of the product. With the second phase coming into operation, the refinery’s daily output has reached 24 million litters and will reach 36 million liters by the end of current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019) when the third phase goes operational, IRIB quoted Mohammad-Ali Dadvar, the managing director of PGSR, as saying. The refinery, which is hailed as the Middle East’s largest gas condensate processing complex, is one of the few refineries in the country that have been designed and constructed by Iranian experts. Putting the value of PGSR’s products at $5.4 billion, Alireza Sadeqabadi, the managing director of National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (NIOPDC), has underlined that through its products the refinery has prevented exit of foreign currency from the country. President Hassan Rouhani along with a number of high-ranking officials including Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and Commander of Khatam al-Anbia Construction Unit Brigadier General Ebadollah Abdollahi attended the inauguration ceremony of the second phase in Bandar Abbas southern Iran.
