“Since it was estimated that that the number of visitors to Pasargadae will increase during this year’s Noruz holidays, all the required measures including providing tourism facilities and security measures were taken,” said Mohammad Talebian, director of Parse and Pasargadae Research Center, a non-governmental organization that works on protection of Persepolis and Pasargadae. “It should be noted that no damages were reported in Persepolis during last Noruz holidays and visitors observed all regulations and security measures in order to preserve this world heritage site. People look at cultural heritage as their own property and they should do their best to protect them,” he added. A team consists of health, information and tour leading experts are present in Persepolis to provide services to tourists who visit this historical site. Comparing to previous years, the number of security guards in this historical site has been tripled. According to statistics, about 350,000 people visited the Achaemenid historic sites of Fars Province during the first ten days of Noruz holidays (March 21-March 31). About 180,000 of the number have visited Persepolis, the site of palaces of Achaemenid kings.
