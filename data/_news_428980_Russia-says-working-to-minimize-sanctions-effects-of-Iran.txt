TEHRAN – Moscow is taking steps to minimize the adverse effect of U.S. sanctions on its relations with Iran, said the spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, while describing the sanctions as “illegitimate”. “We are taking measures to ensure that [U.S. sanctions] have minimal negative impact on Russian-Iranian trade and economic cooperation,” Maria Zakharova said in a press briefing on Thursday, Sputnik reported. She also referred to Iran’s Sirik thermal power plant in the southern country, and the construction of the second and the third units of Bushehr nuclear power plant as instances of economic cooperation between Tehran and Moscow.
