The Danish government has announced plans to expand its official co-operation with Iran through sustainable urban development and patents regarding products. To this end, the Foreign Ministry intends to deploy growth advisers to the nation where co-operative measures are already in full swing. In the wake of international sanctions against Iran being repealed recently, Danish exports, political dialogue and university co-operation have been on the rise. In collaboration with the Business Ministry, the Danish Patent and Trademark Office, and the Iranian authorities, the growth adviser will focus on patents and trademarks.
