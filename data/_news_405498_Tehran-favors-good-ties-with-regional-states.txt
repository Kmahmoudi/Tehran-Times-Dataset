TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Tehran prioritizes good ties with neighboring and regional countries.
 “Undoubtedly, good relations with the neighbors and the regional countries is the priority of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s foreign policy,” ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. Qassemi’s comments came as Kuwaiti Parliament Speaker Marzouq Al-Ghanim told Asharq Al-Awsat in an interview that Kuwait and other Persian Gulf littoral states are interested in expanding ties with Iran. Qassemi said that Iran and its neighbors have great capacities for political and economic relations and countering terrorism. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has always sought stability, security and progress for its neighboring countries based on its principled policy,” he added. He said Iran welcomes any practical action and behavior which is based on good will and expressed hope that some countries’ “unconstructive” policies would not have negative influence on the governments’ will to establish relations.  NA/PA
