TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi strongly condemned a terrorist attack in Afghan capital Kabul on Monday which left at least 29 people dead and 40 injured.
 “In spite of such violent, inhuman and brutal actions by the terrorist and extremist groups, the Afghan government and people will continue the path of fighting extremism and violence more powerfully,” he said. And the Iranian people and government will be on the side of the Afghans in this “difficult path”, Qassemi added.
