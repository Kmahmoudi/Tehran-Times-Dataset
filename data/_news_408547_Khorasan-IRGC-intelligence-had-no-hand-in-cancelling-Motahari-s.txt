TEHRAN – The IRGC spokesman has denied allegations that the intelligence unit of the IRGC in Khorasan had a hand in cancelling Majlis Deputy Speaker Ali Motahari’s speech in Mashhad.

 However, Ramezan Sharif added, the unit had written to Razavi Khorasan Governorate-General and attorney to take due measures to ensure no security breach ensues Motahari’s speech. The cautionary letter was justified in view of the parliamentarian’s record and his statements in the past which have been used as a pretext to cause problems, he said.
