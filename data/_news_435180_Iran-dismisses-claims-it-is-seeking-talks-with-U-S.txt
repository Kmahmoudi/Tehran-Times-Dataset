TEHRAN - Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi on Saturday dismissed claims by foreign media outlets that Iran is seeking talks with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, calling them “unfounded”.
 “There has been no request for talks with the U.S. and there is no negotiation with Saudi Arabia except for the issue of Hajj which is apart from political relations,” Mousavi said. Iran’s policy towards neighboring countries is based on good neighborliness and mutual respect, he noted. “All the neighbors who consider realities and the international developments are prioritized in productive relations.” The ministry spokesman added, “From the point of view of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia is an important country in our region which has taken a wrong path and adopted counter-constructive approach which have led to many problems and crises in the region.”  He expressed hope that Saudi Arabia would choose the path of having good intentions for the regional people. In this situation, Iran will always be ready to interact with Saudi Arabia, he added. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
