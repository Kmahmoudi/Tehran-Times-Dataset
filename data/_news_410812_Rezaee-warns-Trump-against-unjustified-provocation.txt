TEHRAN – The secretary of the Expediency Council on Sunday said Tehran will not allow the U.S. go on to threaten Iran. Speaking in a press conference, Mohsen Rezaee said, “The (Trump) administration has started challenging our country without any reason under influence of the House of Saud and Netanyahu,” IRIB reported. “The House of Saud and the Zionist regime used to agitate Saddam against us… but they failed. So, we advise American officials to let go of such adventurism.” SP/PA
