TEHRAN – Promotion of peace and friendship is the main theme of the 3rd Ordinary Governing Council Meeting of Tehran Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) Center, Iran’s representative to the governing council Mohammad-Hassan Talebian said on Saturday. The Regional Research Center for Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in West and Central Asia under the auspices of UNESCO (Tehran ICH Center) is holding the meeting from May 28 to 30 at Tehran’s Laleh Hotel. Talebian stressed the importance of attending the event by representatives from other member countries since “it would lead to more understanding and friendship in the region.” “Eleven countries are already members of the center and Oman, Qatar, Turkmenistan, and Kuwait have applied for membership,” he said. Iran along with Armenia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Palestine, Tajikistan, and Turkey are the members. In 2006, Iran joined the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, and on April 28, 2010 the agreement regarding the establishment of Tehran ICH Center was signed by Iran and UNESCO. The Center was officially inaugurated in November 2012. SB/   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
