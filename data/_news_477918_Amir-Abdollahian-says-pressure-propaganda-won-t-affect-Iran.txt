TEHRAN— Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian exchanged views on some bilateral issues in a phone call with his Syrian counterpart Faisal Mekdad on Sunday.  The two top diplomats also discussed issues of mutual concern on regional and international arenas. The chief Syrian diplomat referred to the bitter outcome of foreign interventions in Syria under the pretext of protecting human rights, as well as the Israeli regime and its supporters’ failure in conspiring and creating crises against the Syrian government and people. “They seek to create crises against independent countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran. The United States and the West want a devastated and dependent Iran, not a prosperous, advanced and independent Iran. Everyone saw what the U.S. and its allies did to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan,” Mekdad stated.  In turn, Amir Abdollahian emphasized that the Islamic Republic will continue to insist on its principled and rational positions towards the issues of the Islamic world, especially the Palestinian cause and support for the resistance front and the government and people of Syria. The Iranian foreign minister pointed out that the political pressures and propaganda will not disrupt the determination of the Iranian nation and government in “treading the path of honor, independence, progress and supporting the stability and security of the regional countries, opposing foreign interference and the aggression by the usurper Zionist regime,” adding that the Iranian nation will thwart the enemy’s plots with vigilance. The two foreign ministers also emphasized the development of bilateral relations, especially in the economic and commercial fields.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
