TEHRAN – Some half a million foreign travelers visited Isfahan province, central Iran, over the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year (started March 21, 2017). Nationals of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and China respectively constitute the highest number of inbound passengers, said Fereydoun Allahyari who presides over province’s office of the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization. Isfahan city, the provincial capital, lured some 85 thousand foreign sightseers from Mar. 21-Apr. 20, 2017, setting a new record for the past 40 years, showing some 800 percent jump in comparison to the same period a year earlier.  Isfahan is Iran’s top tourist destination for good reasons. Its profusion of tree-lined boulevards, Persian gardens and important Islamic buildings gives it a visual appeal unmatched by any other Iranian city, and the many artisans working here underpin its reputation as a living museum of traditional culture.
