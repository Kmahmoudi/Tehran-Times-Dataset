TEHRAN – Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi has described security in Iran as “unique” in a war-infested Middle East.  Alavi made the remarks on Monday in a meeting with the Leader’s representative to South Khorasan province.  “While the whole region is insecure, there is matchless security in Iran,” he said.  This is while the enemy has been on the lookout to breed insecurity inside country, although “they have never been and will never be successful,” he added.  Over the past five years, the Middle East has been burning in fire. Yet Iran has been safe with terrorist cells being smashed by security forces.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
