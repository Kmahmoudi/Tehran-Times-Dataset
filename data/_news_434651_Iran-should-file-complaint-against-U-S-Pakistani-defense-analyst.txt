TEHRAN - Lieutenant General Amjad Shoaib, a senior Pakistani defense analyst, said on Saturday that Iran should file complaint at the International Criminal Court and the UN against the unjustified U.S. act in designating the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization.
 “The U.S. decision in putting the Guards on the list of terrorist organizations is unjustified,” he said, adding it is aimed at “increasing pressure against Iran.”  He also attached great importance to the role of the IRGC’s role in combatting terrorism in the region. “The U.S. levels accusations against the Guards’ role in the Middle East without any justification,” he told IRNA. U.S. President Donald Trump labeled the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization on April 8. Immediately after the Trump administration labelled the IRGC as terrorist, Iran’s Supreme National Security Council included the U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for American military activities in the Middle East and Central Asia, on Iran’s list of terrorist organizations. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the U.S. act in designating the IRGC as terrorist is “very provocative”, “dangerous” and “unprecedented”. Iran’s Ambassador to the UK Hamid Baeidinejad has said that the U.S. act is just a rhetoric. “I think this is a part of the rhetoric because in fact the realities show that they are not at all interested to see what are the implications of making such decisions for example in the region and within the Iranian nation,” he said in an interview with CNN. Most analysts have said the recognition of the Golan Heights as the Israeli land and the terrorist designation against the IRGC were primarily aimed at promoting the chances of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was facing reelection on April 9.   NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
