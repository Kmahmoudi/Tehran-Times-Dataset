TEHRAN- National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) is determined for a strong return to the European markets and also adding new countries to the list of its customers while it is preparing its fleet to achieve this goal, Sirous Kianersi, the managing director of company, told IRNA on Saturday. The official also announced about his company’s determination to enter liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets through cooperation with some international companies.
He said, “While LNG tankers have been added to our fleet, the number of these tankers is few and we should increase it.”
NITC has prepared a five-year development plan based on which its fleet of tankers should be improved and renovated for strengthening its presence in the international markets, the managing director of company further noted.
He put the number of NITC’s fleet at 69 tankers with the total capacity of 15.5 million tons at present.
Referring to the issue of bunkering, Kianersi said active presence in this field is being followed up, adding, “Given that NITC and Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) enjoy some large fleets of vessels, proper ground is prepared for their activity in this area.”
NITC, which operates the largest tanker fleet in the Middle East and has the world’s largest fleet of super tankers, transports Iranian crude and also acts as an independent entity in contracts with foreign concerns for crude oil transportation based on prevailing international freight rates.
