TEHRAN – The Iranian Parliament’s Committee of Councils and Internal Affairs has released a report on the death of Mahsa Amini.  The report confirmed earlier statements that Amini was not subject to any kind of beating during her detention by the police, according to Tasnim.  The report also warned those who made hasty remarks about the death of Amini and played into the hands of rioters will be prosecuted.  “Those who made hasty remarks before the incident was clarified and played into the hands of the System’s enemies and rioters will be prosecuted if they don’t correct their positions,” the report said.  Mahsa Amini died nearly a month ago after being apprehended by the police. Her death caused protests that turned violent. Iranian authorities have said that the death of Mahsa Amini had nothing to do with the police.  Earlier this month, Iran’s High Council for Human Rights released a new report on the death of Mahsa Amini and the ensuing unrest to provide new information on the situation of human rights in the country. The council said the report has been compiled “with the aim of providing information appertaining to the cause of the death of Mahsa Amini and the facts on the ground regarding the exploitation of the issue in question to spark off riots and insecurity in the society and violate people’s right to security.” According to the report, following the transfer of Mahsa Amini to hospital, the Forensic Medicine Organization – on the order of the Tehran Prosecutor – immediately sent a specialized team to handle the case and conduct a detailed examination of her therein. It added, “Once informed of the death, the body of the deceased was transferred to the Dissection Hall of the Tehran Province Diagnostic and Laboratory Centre where physical examination and autopsy were performed thereon. In dealing with the case, all the criteria and indicators for determining the cause of the death, physical examination and internal organs of the body as well as samples taken from the tissues and internal organs thereof were sent to specialized laboratories so that – as soon as the results of the tests were received and taking into account the results of the examinations and the autopsy, the contents of the hospital file and her medical records, as well as the opinions of experts in related fields, all of which were gathered under the supervision of a special medical commission formed in the Forensic Medicine Organization by the order of the Tehran Prosecutor – the real cause of the death would subsequently be unraveled and notified to the judicial authority.” Citing a coroner’s report on the death of Mahsa Amini, the report said that the death was not caused by blows to the head or any vital organs and parts of the body. The report concluded, “The Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to protecting the basic rights and freedoms of its people according to the accepted laws and obligations; and therefore, it will seriously pursue any restrictions or violations of rights. In this regard, additional reports pertaining the destruction of public and private property and how to deal with judicial cases will be compiled and presented.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
