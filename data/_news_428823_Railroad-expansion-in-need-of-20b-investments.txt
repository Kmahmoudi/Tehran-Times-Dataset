TEHRAN- Some €20 billion is needed to supply the required infrastructure for development of national railway network by March 2021, the Managing Director of Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (known as RAI) Saeed Mohammadzadeh announced in a meeting on Sunday, IRNA reported.   “According to the set programs, 54 percent of the needed investments will be made by the private sector and the rest will be supplied by the government,” he added. “RAI intends to have a 20 percent stake in Iran’s freight transport and a 30 percent one in passenger transport by 2021,” Mohammadzadeh underlined.
