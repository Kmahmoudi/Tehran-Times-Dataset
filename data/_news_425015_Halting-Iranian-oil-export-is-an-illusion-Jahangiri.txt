TEHRAN - First Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Monday that Iran is able to counter the looming U.S. sanctions, noting that those at the White House who think they can halt Iran’s oil export are living in “illusion”. 
 Iran will apply various methods to thwart the U.S. sanctions, Jahangiri said during a meeting of the resistance economy headquarters. Iran will use various methods to prevent a possible reduction in its oil exports after re-imposition of the U.S. sanctions. “Continuation of exporting oil is symbol of victory against the U.S. sanctions and I hope we would witness this great victory through planning by the Oil Ministry,” the vice president explained. He added, “We will prove that the U.S. claim to stop exportation of Iran’s oil is an illusion.”  The senior executive official also attached great importance to continued importation of commodities during the time of sanctions. The vice president also noted that the “vulnerable” social layers should be helped after re-imposition of sanctions. On May 8, President Donald Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the UN-endorsed nuclear agreement and threatened Iran with worst sanctions. The sanctions are going to go into effect in August and November. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
