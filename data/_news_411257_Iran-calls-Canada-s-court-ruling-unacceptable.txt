TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday that a Canadian court’s ruling against Iran is “unacceptable”.
 “This ruling runs contrary to the basic principles of international law about legal immunity of the governments and their properties, and is unacceptable,” he explained. The Ontario court ruled on February 8 that Iran have to pay $300,000 legal bills to those who claim to be victims of Iranian support for resistance groups. Iran has 30 days to pay. Qassemi said the Canadian court has ruled regardless of considering “international law” and the “principle of the governments’ equality”. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has previously announced its complaints about the issue to the Canada government through related channels and the country reserves the right in this respect,” the ministry spokesman pointed out. In June, the same Canadian court issued a political ruling to confirm a verdict for confiscation of $13 million of Iranian assets on the baseless allegation that Iran has supported the terrorist groups.
