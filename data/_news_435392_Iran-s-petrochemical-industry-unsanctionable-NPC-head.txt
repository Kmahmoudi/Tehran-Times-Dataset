TEHRAN – The managing director of Iran’s National Petrochemical Company (NPC) said petrochemical industry is not like oil industry and it is practically unsanctionable. “For oil the ways of selling and the costumers are specific and limited but that is not the case with petrochemicals. There are hundreds of holdings which are eager for buying our diverse petrochemical products”, Behzad Mohammadi told the Tehran Times in a press conference on the sidelines of the 24th Iran International, Oil, Gas, Refining and Petrochemical Exhibition (Iran Oil Show 2019). “However, we are holding meetings with our customers to explore various aspects of possible impacts of the U.S. sanctions on our trade", he added.
