Upon invitation of President Hassan Rouhani, I will pay a visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran from September 7-9, 2015. A high-level political, economic, scientific and cultural delegation will accompany me. I am very much looking forward to my stay. This is my second visit to Iran. I first visited Iran in the year 2000 in my capacity as president of the Austrian Parliament.
