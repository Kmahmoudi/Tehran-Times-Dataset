TEHRAN- Iran Air, Iran’s national flag carrier, has no concern and problem in terms of supplying fuel for its fleet in foreign flights, Tasnim news agency quoted the managing director of the airline as saying. Farzaneh Sharafbafi also said on Sunday that Iran Air has started negotiations with the non-European manufacturers of airplanes in line with renovation of its fleet. “We will negotiate with any manufacturer which can supply airplanes for us without requiring permits from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)”, she noted. OFAC has cancelled licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell airplanes to Iran after Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement in May and reimposed sanctions on the country.
