TEHRAN - Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel, a member of the Expediency Council and a cultural and political figure, said on Tuesday that Iran seeks strategic and long-standing ties with China.
 During a speech at Beijing International Studies University, Hadad Adel said Iran attaches great importance to expansion of cultural relations in order to lay grounds for expansion of ties. He also praised China’s policy of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, describing it as “proper” and “wise” policy. “We believe that in a world in which nations are suffering from adventurism of some powers, China can help create a balance in the international atmosphere through preventing the world from become unipolar,” he stated. The former parliament speaker added that Iran and China can establish stable economic relations, suggesting Iran can meet China’s energy needs and China can make investments in Iran. Hadad Adel noted that Iran prioritizes ties with China in its foreign policy. The White House announced on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump has decided not to renew waivers that allow eight countries, including China, to buy Iranian oil without facing Washington’s sanctions. China’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it has formally complained to the United States over its decision to end waivers on sanctions on Iranian oil imports, Reuters reported. Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, said that China is resolutely opposed to the U.S. enforcing unilateral sanctions. Trump unilaterally pulled Washington out of the 2015 nuclear deal in May 2018 and ordered reimposition of sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4.
