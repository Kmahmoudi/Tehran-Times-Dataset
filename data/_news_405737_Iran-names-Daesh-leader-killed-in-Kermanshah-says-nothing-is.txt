TEHRAN – Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi revealed in a live TV program on Wednesday that Abu Aeshe Kurdi, commander of a Daesh brigade in Mosul, was one of those killed in recent clashes with a terrorist cell in Kermanshah province, western Iran.  “In collaboration with special forces, we managed to kill commander of Daesh brigade in Mosul Abu Aeshe Kurdi and arrest and took out nine of his accomplices,” said Alavi. 
Alavi gave the details one week after Iranian security forces announced they had dismantled a Daesh-affiliated terrorist cell in separate clashes in western Kermanshah province, killing four and arrested more six. 
The news also come amid preparation made by Iraqi forces to launch an assault to retake Mosul, which fell to Daesh control in 2014, after they could successfully liberated Fallujah. Intelligence minister says, “160 million eyes are watching the security of the country and until now, the clues and information we have received from the people have proven effective.”  Iran, which borders Iraq to its west, has been a safe haven in a region torn apart by terrorism and extremism. This is while even some European countries, including France, have been experiencing difficult times over the past months. 
The Iranian minister viewed the unique security of the Middle East powerhouse as a function of a widespread net of security eyes, where all Iranians play the role of a security agent against suspicious cases in the form of national neighborhood watch.
“160 million eyes are watching the security of the country and until now, the clues and information we have received from the people have proven effective,” he said.  
He also stressed that Iran is watching every move made by terrorists in the region: “we have intelligence sway over all terrorists who are acting against Iran.” 
“In southeastern of the country we noticed some tunnels being dug in the direction of two security-military sites where we could catch them off-guard.”  
In June, Iran announced it had thwarted several planned bombings in Tehran and other cities, in what it called a major plot by Sunni Muslim militants against the country.
