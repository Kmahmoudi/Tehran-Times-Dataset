TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that resistance is the only way for Palestinians to fight the Zionist regime of Israel and regain their rights.
 “Israelis have never accepted the Palestinian people’s rights in spite of the Oslo and Madrid agreements. So, the only way is to resist and fight to regain their rights,” he said during a meeting with Ziad al-Nakhala, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad movement, and his accompanying delegation. Rouhani noted that all Muslims should get united to help Palestinians in their struggle for their rights. Referring to the U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, he said that the Iranian people have proved that victory can be gained through resistance. “We have no doubt that we will overcome enemies in this economic war.”  He noted, “The Leader of the Revolution [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] has stood against these plots bravely and the people are united in resistance and fight.” President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. ‘Palestinians won’t abandon resistance until victory’ For his part, Nakhala said that in spite of all pressures and threats, the Palestinians will not abandon resistance until they gain victory. He also praised Iran’s supports for Palestine. Pointing to “the deal of the century”, he said the U.S. and the Zionist regime seek to close the Palestine issue, however the Palestinians have resisted and will resist to prevent realization of the scheme. Trump has proposed to establish a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty over around half of the West Bank and Abu Dis as its capital and has called his plan “deal of century”. ‘Iran to continue supporting Palestinians’ During a separate meeting with Nakhala on Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said that Iran will continue supporting the Palestinians and the Palestinian cause. He noted that it is Iran’s duty to support Palestine. Nakhala thanked Iran for its supports and said that the resistance front will gain victory in the region.
