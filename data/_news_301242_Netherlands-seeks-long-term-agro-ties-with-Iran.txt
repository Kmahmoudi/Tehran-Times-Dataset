TEHRAN - “Amsterdam seeks long-term ties, besides short-term ones, in various agricultural sectors with Tehran,” Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs Henk Kamp said in a Sunday meeting with Iran’s Minister of Agriculture Mahmoud Hojjati.
 Kamp, who made the remarks in the second session of Iran-Netherlands Agricultural Cooperation Meeting in Tehran, noted that the two countries can cooperate in production, processing, and exports of different types of fruits. Hojjati, for his part, said that Iran and the Netherlands enjoy vast potentials for producing, processing, brand building, and marketing medicinal herbs. Expansion of cooperation in this sector would help Iran export value-added medicinal herbs to other countries.   In mid-April, Dutch Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs Martin Van den Berg and the president of the Organization for Investment, Economic, and Technical Assistance of Iran, Mohammad Khazaei signed 10 agreements in various economic fields in a meeting in Tehran.

Reviewing the latest situation for economic cooperation in the joint meeting, Van den Berg referred to the existing investment opportunities and capacities in Iran and underlined expansion of bilateral cooperation.
