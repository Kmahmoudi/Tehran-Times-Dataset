TEHRAN - Kamal Kharrazi, head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, has said that President Donald Trump’s language has discredited title of U.S. president.
 “Given the policies that the U.S. follows, its animosity towards us is natural. The U.S. has unfortunately violated its obligations under the JCPOA [the official name for the international nuclear deal] which shows that it has problems with the Islamic Republic of Iran’s existence,” he told IRNA in an interview published on Tuesday. Kharrazi, a former foreign minister and Tehran’s envoy to the United Nations, also noted that Iran is making efforts in line with its policy to help stabilize the region.
