TEHRAN – Some 40.4 million tons of cargos were transported via railway in Iran during the last Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20), IRNA reported on Monday quoting an official in Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRIR). According to Saeed Rasouli, a board member of IRIR, railway should account for 30 percent of freight transportation in Iran by the end of the country’s Sixth Five-Year National Development Plan (2021).
The official said over 350 worn-out cars were eliminated from the IRIR’s rolling stock last year.
Iran’s parliament has passed a bill, allowing the administration to allocate one percent of oil and gas revenues annually for railways development projects across the country. EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
