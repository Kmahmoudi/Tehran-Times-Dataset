TEHRAN - Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghadam, a member of Iran’s Expediency Council, has said that the council studied on Saturday an overview of the Palermo bill. “The details were not discussed,” he told IRNA. He added, “The judiciary, political and security committees of the council are supposed to further study the bill and present the result of their study in the next session of the council.” He noted that Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Laya Joneidi, the vice president for legal affairs, also attended the council’s meeting. In an interview with IRNA published on Friday, Joneidi said that it is better to finalize issues related to the Palermo Convention to facilitate Europe’s financial mechanism to keep the 2015 nuclear deal. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), which is also called the Palermo Convention, is a 2000 United Nations-sponsored multilateral treaty against transnational organized crime.
