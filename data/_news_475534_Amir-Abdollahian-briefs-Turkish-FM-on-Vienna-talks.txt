TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian on Wednesday briefed his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu on the Vienna talks intended to lift sanctions on Iran. “We have sent our message to America through Europeans and we hope that the American side to create the situation for agreeing on the final text by adopting a realistic and pragmatic approach toward the rightful and legal demands of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Amir Abdollahian noted. The talks to revitalize the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), started in April 20121. The last round of talks was resumed after nearly a five-month hiatus in Vienna on August 4. The negotiating sides said relative progress was made to resuscitate the agreement. However, after four days, the negotiators from Iran and the U.S. returned to capitals for consultation with top officials. The return to capitals followed after European Union chief for foreign affairs and security policy Josep Borrell presented what he called a final text to revive the JCPOA. The Iranian foreign minister hopes U.S. to lay the groundwork to restore the JCPOA by adopting a realistic and pragmatic approach. Iran has been insisting that nothing is agreed until everything is resolved. In a tweet on August 8, Borrell, who is the coordinator of the JCPOA talks, tweeted, “What can be negotiated has been negotiated, and it’s now in a final text. However, behind every technical issue and every paragraph lies a political decision that needs to be taken in the capitals.” Oman says success of nuclear talks will benefit all sides Iran’s chief diplomat also held phone talks with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi about the Vienna negotiations. Amir Abdollahian also praised Oman for its mediation efforts to put the nuclear deal on the right track and thereby lift the sanctions on Iran. For his part, al-Busaidi said, “Oman believes that a success of negotiations will benefit all sides.” Oman and Qatar has been mediating between Iran and the U.S. to restore the nuclear agreement. Prior to the recent Vienna talks, Qatar hosted indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. in late June. As usual, the talks were coordinated by Borrell’s deputy Enrique Mora.

The two chief diplomats also assessed the July 19 visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his top delegation team to Iran as positive and exchanged views on implementing the agreements made in the seventh Iran-Turkey high council meeting. Amir Abdollahian said President Ebrahim Raisi has ordered related bodies to seriously follow up on the agreements signed during Erdogan’s visit to Tehran.
