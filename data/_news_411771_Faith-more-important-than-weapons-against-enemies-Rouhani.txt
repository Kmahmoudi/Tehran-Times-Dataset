TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani has said that what makes Iran stronger against its enemies, especially the U.S. and Israel, is not just weapons but also the nation’s faith, determination and unity. Rouhani made the remarks at an annual event commemorating martyrs in Mashhad on Wednesday. “Today’s war is a war of determinations,” he said. The president underlined the need to possess advanced weapons to resist the enemies in case a war breaks out, saying “We should develop missiles and aircrafts and we do.” However, he said that the enemy “fears the nation’s faith and determination more than weapons.” The president also said there is no end to wars and that speaking of peace only means ending military actions. “However, the economic war will never end,” he said, referring to the new U.S. president’s first speech which was about an economic war with the country’s allies.  Elsewhere in his remarks, Rouhani hailed the Iranian people’s resistance against the enemies in the last 38 years. “Even today, pressure and sanctions exist, but we resist [the enemy] in any difficult condition.” He also said that only nuclear-related sanctions were lifted and other sanctions were not discussed in the nuclear negotiations.
