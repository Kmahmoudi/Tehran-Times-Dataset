Booking.com, a world-famous online reservation company, has recently added Iranâ€™s rial to its currency system to address what used to be a challenge of limited financial access, CHTN reported on Thursday. Now, a number of Iranian hotels and hostels have joined Booking.com to facilitate room reservation for both domestic and foreign travelers.
Established in 1996 in Amsterdam, Booking.com has been developed from a small Dutch start-up to one of the largest travel e-commerce companies in the world. Its website supports 40 languages as well and over 1,550,000 room nights are reserved on its platform each day.
