TEHRAN – The Australian Ambassador to Tehran, Ian Biggs, said on Sunday that Canberra strongly supports the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 The JCPOA helps establish peace in the Middle East region, he said during a meeting with Mahmoud Sadeqi, the head of Iran-Australia parliamentary friendship group. However, Sadeqi said the sanctions against Iran by the U.S. Congress are contrary to international law. Last month, the two houses of the U.S. Congress ratified non-nuclear sanctions against Iran. The sanctions were mainly targeted at Iran’s missile capability. Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council including the United States signed the nuclear deal in July 2015. It went into effect in January 2016. On August 15, Rouhani said that Iran will quit nuclear agreement “in hours” and return to the previous stage if sanctions are re-imposed on the country. Australia was a supporter of negotiations between Iran and great powers. Its foreign minister visited Iran after 12 years in April 2015. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also made a trip to Australia in March 2016. Since the conclusion of the nuclear deal economic and scientific teams from Australia have visited Iran. Australian experts are sharing knowledge with Iran on areas of water scarcity.
 
Economic, political ties Ambassador Biggs and MP Sadeqi also exchanged views on economic and political ties. The ambassador said both the Australia government and parliament prioritize cooperation with the Islamic Republic. Sadeqi said the two countries enjoy great capacities to strengthen ties in various spheres. Parliamentary relations help expand interaction between Iran and Australia, the MP said. Biggs also called for continued consular talks in line with efforts to resolve the problem of Iranian refugees in Australia.
