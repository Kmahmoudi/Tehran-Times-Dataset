TEHRAN – The newly appointed Armed Forces chief of staff said on Sunday that he has been commissioned by the Supreme Leader to promote capability, preparation, and responsiveness of the Iranian Armed Forces as well as coordination among its four components.  “The first duty is to promote capabilities of the Armed Forces,” said Major General Mohammad Baqeri. As of the 1979 revolution, the Iranian Army has been under arms embargoes by the U.S., with even a stricter arms embargo over the past decade over the nuclear program followed by Tehran. However, Iran has managed to shore up its defensive capabilities via home-grown technologies. According to Baqeri, boosting defensive and security agility comes second on the agenda “which is in a sense the main goal of appropriating national funds to the defense sector of the country.” The agility parameter is vital for Iran considering its strategic location in the Middle East. The geographical vastness and long borders it shares with insecure countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq demand the country’s armed forces to be on their toes. The third priority is to strengthen military responsiveness at all levels incommensurate with a multitude of threats, the commander stressed “which can be achieved through completing intelligence, operation, and logistics processes, as well as appropriate controlling.” Cooperation between the four components of the Iranian armed forces has been a continuous emphasis in the remarks of the Supreme Leader, Baqeri said, adding, “The Armed Forces General Staff for Joint Affairs is responsible for cooperation between them.” According to the Constitution, the Iranian Armed Forces consist of Army, the IRGC, police, and Defense Ministry. The Armed Forces General Staff for Joint Affairs was established during the first years of the war Iraq started against Iran for more harmonious cooperation between the Army, as the regular force of the country, and the fledging IRGC, as a revolutionary force. The Supreme Leader on June 28 officially named Baqeri as the Armed Forces chief of staff. Baqeri formerly served as the deputy chief of staff of Armed Forces for Intelligence Affairs and also the head of the Armed Forces General Staff for Joint Affairs. He replaced Major General Hassan Firouzabadi who was holding the position as of 1989 and will be serving hereafter as advisor to the Leader.  Baqeri, 56, is the youngest ever military official appointed to such as high position.   AK/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
