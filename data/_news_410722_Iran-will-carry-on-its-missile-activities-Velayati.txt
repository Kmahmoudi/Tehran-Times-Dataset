TEHRAN – A top foreign policy advisor to the Supreme Leader vowed on Thursday that Iran will push ahead with its missile program regardless of Washington’s empty threats against the Islamic Republic. Ali Akbar Velayati told reporters that Iran’s latest missile test is part of the country’s defense program. “Iran will vigorously continue with its missile activities,” the veteran politician noted. Velayati’s comments came after U.S. President Donald Trump put Iran “on notice” for test-firing a ballistic missile that Washington says could be in violation of a UN resolution which was passed to endorse the Iran nuclear agreement. Resolution 2231 calls on Iran not to “undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” Iran maintains that it does not intend to manufacture missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Responding to Trump’s hawkish remarks, Velayati said Iran pays no attention to American threats. The top official further said that Tehran needs no permission from any country for defending itself. He also called Trump an “inexperienced” president who should learn from previous rulers of the United States. “This is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran,” Velayati said. “Iran is the strongest power in the region and has a lot of political, economic and military power ... America should be careful about making empty threats to Iran.” The new U.S. president has ordered a temporary visa ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries including Iran.
 
“What the new American administration has done will hurt the American people,” he said, adding that the American people disapprove of Trump’s extremism. MH/PA
