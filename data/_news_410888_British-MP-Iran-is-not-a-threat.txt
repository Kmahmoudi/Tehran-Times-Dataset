TEHRAN – A member of the House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, has said Iran is not a threat. “I think Britain could… persuade Israel that Iran is not a threat so long as we are fair with them,” Jennifer Louise Tonge told IRNA in reference to Britain’s recent invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  “I am very disappointed of Theresa May. I had hoped that she would be more fair minded about this,” she said. SP/PA
