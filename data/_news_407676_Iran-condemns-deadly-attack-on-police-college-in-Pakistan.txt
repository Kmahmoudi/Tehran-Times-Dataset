TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned on Tuesday the terrorist attack on a police college in the Pakistani city of Quetta.
 Ministry spokesperson Bahram Qassemi offered the Pakistani government and people condolences and called for serious fight against terrorism. “Iran expresses readiness to help Pakistani government in countering the terrorist groups,” Qassemi stated. On Monday, three militants wearing suicide bomb vests entered a Balochistan police college in Quetta killing at least 59 people injured more than 110 others. Daesh claimed responsibility for the attack, although officials have blamed another militant group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Officials said most of the deaths were caused by two suicide blasts, with the third attacker shot dead before he could blow himself up. Many of the cadets sustained injuries after jumping out of windows to escape, Guardian reported. NA/PA
