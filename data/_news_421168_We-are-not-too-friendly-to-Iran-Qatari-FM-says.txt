TEHRAN – Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has said that his country is “not too friendly to Iran,” adding that Qatar only wants a “peaceful neighborhood”. Speaking with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Al Thani said, “We are sharing borders with Iran as we are sharing borders with Saudi.” “We have differences with Iran’s policies… but those differences and conflicts won’t be solved in a battlefield. They will be solved by dialogue.” He also said Saudi Arabia’s accusations that Qatar supports terrorism are baseless. MH/PA
