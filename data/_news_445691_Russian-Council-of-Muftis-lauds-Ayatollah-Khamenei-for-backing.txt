He suggested that constructive relationship in areas of politics, economy, and culture should be increased between Russia and Iran The Russian Muslims support such ties, which have already proven effective in solving the Syrian crisis, council chairman added. Gainutdin said that the Americans and Europeans are worried about the unity between Tehran and Moscow and that the U.S. sanctions on Iran, Russia, China, and Turkey are because they see the unity between these three countries as threat to their hegemony. The religious leader of Russian Muslims also said that the U.S.-proposed “Deal of the Century” had been long opposed by the peace-loving nations because the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must not be one-sided and imposed by others.

All the world is seeing Russia and Iran are defending the rights of the Palestinians together, he said.

He also thanked the Russian Council of Muftis, especially Gainutdin, for its efforts to enhance dialogue among Abrahimic religions.
