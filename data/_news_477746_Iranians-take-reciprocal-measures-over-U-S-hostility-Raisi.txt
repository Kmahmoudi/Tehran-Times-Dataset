TEHRAN- Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi stated that Iranian from all walks of life will never remain passive in the face of U.S. hostilities and move to counteract Washington's hostility. In a phone call with Sultan of Oman Haitham bin Tariq Al Said on Monday, Raisi said that the U.S. erred by encouraging and escalating unrest in Iran after a young woman died at a police station in Tehran.  He added that “the U.S. has falsely imagined that its sanctions would stop the Iranian nation, but when they saw that not only did the Iranian nation not stop in the face of sanctions, but it continued to make progress, it resorted to sedition against the Islamic Republic of Iran.” Raisi made the remarks in the wake of the meddling statements from U.S. President Joe Biden and his senior officials backing the recent riots in Iran that followed the death of Mahsa Amini.  “We stand with the Iranian citizens, for real, for real”, Biden said, adding that he was "stunned" by how Iranians have responded to Amini's death. Iranians protested the passing of Amini, however some extreme groups disrupted the demonstrations and incited violence against security forces, while Western-backed media outlets also advocated violence. Speaking at a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Raisi also vehemently denounced American assistance for the recent riots in Iran and said that the country was directly involved in the majority of acts of sabotage, assassinations, and riots in the region. “The latest remarks by the U.S. President, who allows himself to fan the flames of unrest, assassination and destruction in another country, remind us of everlasting words of the founder of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini who called the United States ‘the Great Satan’,” the Iranian president remarked.  In other parts of his conversation, Raisi emphasized the high degree of trust and collaboration between Iran and Oman and said that the two nations' relations in a number of areas are on the rise.  He reaffirmed Iran's resolve to deepen ties with Oman in a variety of fields and expressed optimism that Tehran and Muscat will continue to intensify communication as they had in the previous year. For his part, the Omani Sultan pledged to personally monitor the implementation of the agreements struck between the two countries. He continued by saying that improving ties between the two countries is advantageous. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
