Turkmen mothers chant hudikhani - a series of folk lyrics - for their babies. Hudi, which literally means God saying in Persian, is couplets narrating folk and religious stories in rhythm. Motherly love toward her children, nationalism, sacrifice, kindness, honesty and human values are the main themes of the lullabies. The main difference between Turkmen lullabies with others is their focus on music.

Iran is home to about 20 ethnic groups who live in different regions of the country. SB/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
