In spite of a lofty aura bestowed by a deep ruling system, even classical American politicians have by no means been so spotless as they have been pretending.  Beneath their imposing, disarming political rhetoric padded out with pejorative words, there are undertones of superiority, hubris, and authority: democracy, only its American type; color, the American society; race, all the same to a typically American mind, etc.  And this is exactly where a nuanced paradox sneaks in.  Unlike previous American presidents who each in a peerless way spoke and implied two ends of a continuum simultaneously, the upstart realtor-turned-president Donald Trump is hardwired with a one-track-mind, speaking his inmost Jungian sub-conscious straight and acting accordingly.  From cranky, lewd catcalls to his most recent disparagingly racist executive orders, the erratic, impossible personality has cast a shroud of skepticism virtually on the whole fabric of the American society and the principles it has been standing for.   Months of campaign’s canvassing operation had already given the world a nasty taste of this Trumpian personality, not even bearable as a cartoon character who may get to the audience in the blink of an eye.    Trump made “Make America Great Again” a key element of his stump speeches, and he is delivering his promises now but in a Trumpian way.  He could simply make America great by expanding opportunity for the American society, embracing diversity and disregarding discrimination in a country of enormous diversity.  Neither construction of walls nor travel bans will contribute to a greater America.  Greatness is a concept which forms and is nurtured in inclusive, beautiful minds which abominate prejudice and dual standards in their entirety, from which Trump and his doppelgangers are miles way.  America is no longer the beacon of democracy, and under Trump, a black-clad Statue of Liberty will make more sense to the world.  AK/PA
