TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani offered his congratulations to the Indonesian people and government over the Southeast Asian country’s Independence Day. In a message to his Indonesian counterpart Joko Widodo on Wednesday, President Rouhani felicitated the 71st anniversary of the country’s Independence Day and called for closer ties between Tehran and Jakarta in all spheres. “I hope that in light of the existing political will and through using the two countries’ numerous capacities, we will witness the expansion of relations and cooperation in all political, economic, cultural and international areas,” he said in the message. The Iranian president further wished Widodo health and success and prosperity for the “Muslim and brother people” of Indonesia. Indonesia, a Southeast Asian nation made up of thousands of volcanic islands, is home to hundreds of ethnic groups speaking many different languages. Indonesia had been a Dutch colony for over 300 years when a group of revolutionaries declared independence on August 17, 1945.
