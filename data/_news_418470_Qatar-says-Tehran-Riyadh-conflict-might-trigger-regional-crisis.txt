TEHRAN – Qatar's Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on Monday that the existing tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia might trigger new crisis which is beyond the tolerance of the region. In an interview with Turkish TRT news channel on Monday, Al Thani said Iran and Qatar share common interests with Saudi Arabia and that differences should be resolved through negotiations between the two sides.  Countries that have blockaded Qatar never miss the opportunity to mount crisis against Qatar and are opposed to any type of negotiations to help resolve the dispute, he said.
