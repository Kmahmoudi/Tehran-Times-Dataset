TEHRAN – Iran’s northeastern city of Birjand will play host to a national handicrafts exhibition, which will open its doors to the public on December 10, the organizers say. The sales exhibit will embrace over 100 booths to be dedicated to traditional jewelry, local garments, ceramics, potteries, woodwork, illuminated manuscript, enamel, leatherwork, handwoven products, metalwork, and marquetry, amongst other works. Handicrafts exports from Iran hit a record high over the first four months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-July 22, 2017) with 45.4 percent growth in contrast to the same period a year earlier. The growth was tagged as the highest in exports of non-oil products from the country, Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization announced in September. Over the past couple of years, dozens of high-quality Iranian handicrafts have been honored with the UNESCO Seal of Excellence.
