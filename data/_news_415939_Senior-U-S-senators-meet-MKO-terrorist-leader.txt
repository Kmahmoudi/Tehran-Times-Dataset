A senior delegation of the U.S. senators met on Saturday with Maryam Rajavi, leader of the terrorist Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization, in Albania.
 According to The Huffington Post, Senators Roy Blunt, Vice President of the Republican Conference, and member of the Appropriation, Select Intelligence, Rules and Administration, and Commerce, Science, and Transportation committees; John Cornyn, the Majority Whip, and a member of the Judiciary, Select Intelligence, and Finance committees; and Thom Tillis, a member of the Armed Services, Judiciary, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and Veteransâ€™ Affairs committees, also visited members of the MKO. During the meeting, Rajavi expressed her gratitude for the tireless efforts of the U.S. Senate, particularly Senator Blunt, regarding the protection of thousands of MKO members in Iraq, and their safe relocation to Albania. The MKO fled Iran in 1986 for Iraq and was given a camp by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It fought on the side of Saddam in the Iraqi imposed war on Iran during which the former Iraqi dictator used chemical weapons against Iranian civilians and military on a massive scale. The notorious group is also responsible for killing more than 17,000 Iranians in different acts of terrorism, including bombings in public places and targeted killings. Earlier in April, U.S. Senator John McCain met Rajavi in Albania. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
