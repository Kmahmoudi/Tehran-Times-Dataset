TEHRAN – On Sunday Mohammad Reza Bahonar was appointed as head of the Expediency Council’s Incorporation and Assessment Committee, ISNA reported.

 Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezaee, speaking in a session to introduce Bahonar in his new capacity, said the committee has so far been a great help to other committees’ expert content production. Rezaee hoped that Bahonar’s long political career as a lawmaker helps improve the committee’s functioning as an inter-sectional body that coordinates other committees’ tasks.
