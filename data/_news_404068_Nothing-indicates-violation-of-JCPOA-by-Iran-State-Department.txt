TEHRAN - John Kirby, the spokesman of the U.S. State Department, said on Thursday that there is no information that indicates Iran has violated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly called the nuclear deal.

 “We have no information to indicate that Iran has procured any materials in violation of the JCPOA.  More generally, the IAEA has reported that Iran continues to implement its nuclear-related commitments under the deal.  We understand that Germany shares this view and is not suggesting that Iran has violated its JCPOA commitments,” he said. On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German parliament that Iran’s missile program runs contrary to the relevant provisions of the UN Security Council. Kirby said that the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran continues to implement its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA. Iran’s Foreign Ministry announced on Saturday that Merkel’s claims are “unproductive” and Iran’s missile program is just for defense. In July 2015, Iran and the 5+1 group (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) finalized the text of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in Vienna. The deal went into effect in January 2016.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
