 Speaking to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) on Saturday night, Ali Akbar Velayati said the main factor behind the Islamic Republic’s power is the massive presence of the people in various scenes, ranging from the “Sacred Defense” during the 1980-1988 Iraqi war on Iran to different political areas.
