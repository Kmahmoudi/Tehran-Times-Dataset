TEHRAN- In the wake of fresh attacks of U.S. and its allies to Syria early in the morning, Iranian Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the military attacks of three countries including U.S., UK and France on Syria and warned on the regional and trans-regional consequences of the attack.  For this purpose, Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement and wrote, “the current attack waged by U.S. and its allies including UK and France is clear and flagrant violation of international laws and norms and ignores the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria.” Islamic Republic of Iran is against any use of chemical weapons but at the same time, it condemns using pretexts for invading any independent country, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Ghassemi maintained. “There is no doubt that the U.S. and its allies that are engaged a military intervention in Syria without any substantiated document and before any final report of the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and have supposed themselves as the world police and judge, are responsible for regional and international repercussions of the adventure, and should be held accountable,” he said. In conclusion, Ghassemi added, “undoubtedly, US military attack on Syria will weaken fundamentals of peace and security in the world and helps spread of instability and unrest in every part of the world as well as improvement of extremism and terrorism.” (Source: mehrnews) All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
