TEHRAN – Iran's Emergency Services Organization has announced readiness to provide medical treatment for the victims of the Zionist regime's brutal attacks on Gaza. “Iran’s Emergency Services is ready to send medical teams in order to help the Gazans wounded in the wake of Israel’s brutal attacks and it is doing its best to transfer the injured to Iran for treatment if necessary,” the organization’s head Pir Hossein Kolivand wrote in a letter to Health Minister Saeed Namaki. On May 6, the Israeli Supreme Court decided a forced eviction of the Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem. The Palestinians protested over the unfair ruling, as they were forced to leave their homes. Israeli forces stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam’s third holiest site, and dispersed the Palestinian worshippers elsewhere in East Jerusalem. Israel has been heavily bombing Gaza since last Monday, in which 197 Palestinians have been killed so far, including 58 children and 34 women, and 1,235 Palestinians were also injured. The Palestinian resistance has also launched rain rockets in the occupied territories in response to the Israeli aggression and attacks on Gaza.
