TEHRAN - Millions of citizens in Iran took to the streets across the country on Saturday to celebrate the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution that toppled the despotic Pahlavi regime. The rallies in the capital Tehran began at 9:30 a.m. local time (06:00 GMT), with marchers from various social strata and different parts of the city marching toward the iconic Azadi (Freedom) Square. People waved photos of the late founder of the Islamic Revolution Imam Khomeini, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and legendary General Qassem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a 2020 U.S. terrorist attack near the Iraqi capital Baghdad, as well as the martyrs of the Revolution. The flight of colored balloons and iridescent papers from the Azadi Tower, the performance of professional parachutists of the Armed Forces and the mass recital of Iran’s national anthem were among the celebratory events held in the Azadi Square, Press TV reported. On the eve of the 44th anniversary, fireworks displays were performed in Tehran and other cities at 9:00 p.m. overnight, as people chanted Allahu Akbar (God is the Great) in an expression of support for the Islamic Revolution.  The rallies were held in 1,400 Iranian cities and 38,000 villages. The mass rallies on the 22nd of Bahman in the solar calendar, which corresponds with February 11, are held each year with tremendous patriotic fervor in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian nation overthrew the despotic regime of Pahlavi, which was fully supported by the United States in the winter of 1979. The struggle against the shah regime reached full fruition on February 11, 1979. By December 1978, millions of Iranians had taken to the streets in protest against the policies of the shah – Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – on a regular basis. Imam Khomeini returned to Iran from exile on February 1, 1979. He was received by millions of people weeks after the departure of the shah in mid-January 1979. The collapse of the Pahlavi regime became certain on February 11 when the military renounced its loyalty to the shah and joined the Revolution. Raisi says Bahman 22nd marks ‘truth over falsity’ Delivering a speech at the Azadi Square, President Ebrahim Raisi lauded the 22nd of Bahman as the day of the triumph of “truth over falsity,” the day of the victory of “the oppressed over the arrogant,” and the realization of the “miracle of the century.” Raisi said the epic day put an end to tyranny and dependence and marked the beginning of independence, freedom and the Islamic Republic, adding that the day brought about the crystallization of the will of the great nation of Iran. Stressing that both the establishment and the continuation of the Pahlavi regime was against the nation’s will and accompanied with a coup d'état, the Iranian president said, “They committed crimes and treason during their rule, and they were unconcerned about [Iranian people’s] great capacities, and only cared for the pleasure of the global hegemony and the United States." “Pahlavi's despotic rule only brought backwardness to this nation and country,” Raisi added, “They came to power against the principles of the Constitution and with a coup.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
