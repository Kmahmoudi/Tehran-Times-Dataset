Wendy Sherman, the former senior U.S. nuclear negotiator with Iran, has said that termination of the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is not the right path as long as Iran adheres to it.
 She made the remarks in an interview with Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen. U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled Washington out of the JCPOA in May 2018 and ordered reimposition of sanctions against Iran. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 16, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence urged European powers Germany, France, and Britain to follow Washington in withdrawing from the deal and to "stop undermining U.S. sanctions."Â  On January 31, France, Germany and Britain announced the creation of INSTEX, a special purpose vehicle aimed at facilitating legitimate trade between European economic operators and Iran. The European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said INSTEX will support legitimate European trade with Iran. Russia and China have also remained publicly committed to the existing accord. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
