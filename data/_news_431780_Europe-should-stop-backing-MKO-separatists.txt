TEHRAN - Presidential chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi said on Saturday that Europe should stop supporting the Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) and separatist groups.
 “Europe should not forget that it was the Islamic Republic of Iran that helped the Syrian and Iraqi people in fight against Daesh,” he told IRNA. The remarks by the presidential chief of staff was in reaction to Danish Foreign Minister  Anders Samuelsen who in tweet on Tuesday said the European Union had agreed to enact sanctions against an Iranian Intelligence Service over claims of assassination plot in his country.
