TEHRAN – The Islamic Republic of Iran has proven to be a source of security and stability in the Middle East, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said on Thursday. Pointing to Iran’s role in defeating Daesh (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria, Shamkhani said whenever regional nations have faced trouble, Iran has rushed to their help, Mehr reported. He also denounced U.S. President Donald Trump’s business-oriented approach toward foreign policy, his lack of political experience and inability to analyze issues and his efforts to portray Iran as a troublemaker in the region.
