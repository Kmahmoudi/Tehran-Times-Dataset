TEHRAN – The Golden Eagle Danube Express luxury train, carrying 74 tourists from the U.S., the Netherlands, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Australia, arrived in the northwestern Iranian city of Tabriz on Tuesday.
 The tourists paid visits to Azarbaijan Museum, Blue Mosque, and Grand Bazaar and left the city on Wednesday. Tourists flew from Istanbul to Tabriz and get on the train, which had crossed the Turkey-Iran border empty due to ongoing unrests in Turkish cities.  During their eight-day trip, they will sojourn in the cities of Kashan, Isfahan, Shiraz, Yazd, Mashhad, and Tehran and then they will leave Iran by plane for Budapest. It is the fourth time that the train has entered Iran since 2014. The Golden Eagle Danube Express is the first European luxury train allowed into both Turkey and Iran. The train comprises 13 lavishly-decorated wood-paneled 1950s carriages and berths for about 70 guests and set off from Budapest. The train passed Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey before reaching Iran. SB/   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
