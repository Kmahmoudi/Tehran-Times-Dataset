His Eminence had also brought up the issue of using oil as a weapon in some of his previous speeches. Oil is an being used for exerting pressure on independent countries  In the past, when some Islamic countries decided to confront the Zionist regime by refusing to sell their oil, westerners created uproar with the excuse that Islamic countries are making political use of oil. However today, in complete harmony with American policies, the same countries are using oil as a weapon in cooperation with some members of OPEC and some countries in our region which are harmed by these policies themselves. Ayatollah Khamenei at meeting with President of Venezuela, October 22, 2016  We should end our dependance on oil We should take measures, so that the Iranian nation ends their reliance on oil. Because, unfortunately, in today’s world oil is tied to international politics, campaigns, stark pillaging and arrogant imperialists. In fact, oil is in their hands. Whenever they wish, they drop oil prices, increase or decrease oil production, pull one country in or push them out of their circle! We have the oil, but someone else controls oil policies! Such capital is a source of many troubles. Ayatollah Khamenei, March 23, 1996. In support of Palestine, Arab countries should boycott oil trade with Israel’s supporters for a month

What the westerners are propagating in this world—that one should not use oil as a weapon—is not equitable. The oil belongs to people of nations and they can use it to fulfill their own benefit. The Americans used wheat and food products as weapons, in many regions, elsewhere in the world they do the same. Why can’t Muslim and Arab countries have that same right? For one month—only a month—in a symbolic act, they should cut oil exports to all countries that have friendly ties to Israel. Arab states should do that for their own sake. If they do so for only one month—not permanently—as a symbolic display in support of the Palestinian nation, the world would be moved.
