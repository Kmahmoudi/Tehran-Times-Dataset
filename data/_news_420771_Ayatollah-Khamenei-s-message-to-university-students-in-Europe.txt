TEHRAN – Ayatollah Khamenei issued a message to participants attending the 52nd conference of the Islamic Union Association for Iranian Students in Europe. 

 The full text of the message is as follows: In the Name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful: Dear Young University Students, The current era and its developments define certain expectations for young individuals, which did not exist or were not known in previous times. Young university students should, thoroughly, understand these developments and the corresponding expectations, and thus prepare themselves. Islamic associations and the religious climate within them can assist you in preparing yourselves. The main point is that you work for the sake of God, enthusiastically, fulfilling your duties. If you accomplish the blessed opportunity [to do so], Divine Guidance will come to your aid, too. God willing.
I ask God to grant all of you bliss and success. Sayyid Ali Khamenei
