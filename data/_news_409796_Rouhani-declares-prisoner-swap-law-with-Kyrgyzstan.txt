TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani wrote on Wednesday to Justice Ministry declaring a prisoner swap law with Kyrgyzstan.  The law had already been passed by the Iranian parliament and confirmed by the Guardian Council.  Primary agreements had been reached during a visit to Iran by Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev in April 2016 when the two sides signed as many as 47 documents.  Iran has reached an increasing number of prisoner swap agreements with foreign countries ever since President Rouhani took office in 2013.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
