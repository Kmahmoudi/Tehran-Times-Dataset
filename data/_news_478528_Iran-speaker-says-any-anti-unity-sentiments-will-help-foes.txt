TEHRAN- Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, speaker of the Iranian Parliament, has issued a warning that any position that undermines national unity would be seen as "loading the enemy's gun". In a speech to the parliament on Wednesday, Ghalibaf urged the Iranian people to maintain their unity. Underlining the need for unity when it comes to ethnicity and religion, he noted that the presence of lawmakers from all religions and ethnicities in the parliament symbolize unification. He pointed out that the Islamic Revolution's success and the endurance of the Islamic Republic, as well as anti-arrogance spirit were all based on unity. Regarding the province of Sistan-Baluchestan in southeast Iran, he asserted investigation into the region's history reveals that the Baluch people have consistently protected Iran and its independence and have been in the forefront of the struggle against colonialism and global arrogance. The speaker continued by saying that the enemy wants to split up Iran and therefore “we should maintain national unity”. He also said that since the enemies, particularly the U.S. and the Zionist regime, are trying to put a stop to revolutionary movements, “we should guard our unity in order to be able to stand against them.” A lawmaker named Mohammad Taghi Naghdali also stated on Wednesday that claim by those who say there is no freedom in the country is unacceptable, saying if there was no freedom, a tribune could not be given to MPs every week to speak anything they pleased. The legislator said massive marches across the country on National Day of Fighting against Global Arrogance on November 4 served as a wake-up call for influential people to avoid divisive remarks.
