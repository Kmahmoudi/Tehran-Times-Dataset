Ayatollah Jannati who along with Economy Minister Tahmasb Mazaheri is currently visiting Bosnia to attend the burial ceremony of the late former president of this Balkan republic Alija Izetbegovic, conveyed the condolence message of the Iranian nation and government to the Bosnian prime minister on behalf of his nation and government. He said, "Late President Izetbegovicâ€™s demise was a grave loss for the Bosnian nation, but the services he rendered to this republic would last for yet many generations to come." Jannati added, "Izetbegovic sincerely served and preserved the vital interests of your country, and his path would hopefully have more wayfarers from among his friends and supporters." Economy Minister Mazaheri, too, said during the meeting that there are lots of unused capacities in the economy of both countries, and Iran really hopes to facilitate them in the interest of both nations. Prime Minister Terzic, too, during the meeting thanked the great assistance rendered by the Iranian government to the Bosnian nation and government, adding, "Late President Izetbegovic`s selfless struggles has made the Bosnian Muslims heavily obliged to pursue his bright path laid before us by him." The head of Bosnia`s Council of Ministers said, "Izetbegovic tried to improve Bosnia`s ties with the European community throughout his tenure, but he meanwhile attached great importance to ties with the Islamic world countries." Terzic meanwhile referred to Tehran and Sarajevo`s shared strong political will to expand comprehensive bilateral ties, particularly economic bonds, arguing, "The expansion of political ties minus improving economic and business cooperation will not last long." Welcoming the Islamic Republic of Iran`s recently made proposal regarding the establishment of a joint economic commission, he said, "Bosnia is currently in dire need of drastically increasing its exports, and attracting foreign investments to eliminate the economic problems it is faced with." Late former Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, the first president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Republic, passed away after a long period of hospitalization of a heart attack last week. He had played a quite significant role in the independence struggles of the Bosnian people, and led them through a tough decade of war and peace in the 1990s.
