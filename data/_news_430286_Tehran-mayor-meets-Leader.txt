TEHRAN – Mayor of Tehran, Pirouz Hanachi, visited the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday, ISNA reported.  “Using experts for managing the Municipality is the main strategy to organize the city. Yesterday, when the opportunity came up to meet the Leader, as he also emphasized the need for the use of specialists and experts [for properly managing the city] and attention to the cultural identity and Iranian-Islamic architecture, I became more resolute in my decision,” Hanachi wrote in Persian on his tweeter account on Tuesday. Hanachi, was elected by Tehran City council as the mayor of the capital of Iran on November 13 and Interior Ministry confirmed him on November 29.  Since the first session of the fifth Tehran City Council held on August 23, 2017, the council had to elect two mayors. First Mohammad Ali Najafi was named as the mayor who kept the post for almost 7 months and then resigned due to his deteriorating health caused by prostate cancer.  After Najafi, Samiollah Hosseini Makarem became the caretaker and finally a month later in mid-May Afshani secured the seat as the mayor who is banned from keeping office as he is retired following a law passed by Iranian parliament in September putting ban on employment of the retirees.
