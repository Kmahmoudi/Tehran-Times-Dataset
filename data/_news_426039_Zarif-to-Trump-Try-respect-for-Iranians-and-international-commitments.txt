TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump should try respect for the Iranians and also for the international commitments.
 “Iran & U.S. had 2 yrs of talks. With EU/E3+Russia+China, we produced a unique multilateral accord—the JCPOA. It’s been working. U.S. can only blame itself for pulling out & leaving the table. Threats, sanctions & PR stunts won’t work. Try respect: for Iranians & for int’l commitments,” Zarif tweeted. His comments came as Trump said in a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday that he is ready to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without setting any pre-condition. “It’s good for the country, good for them, good for us and good for the world. No preconditions. If they want to meet, I’ll meet,” Trump said. However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CNBC hours after Trump’s statements on Monday to set some conditions. “We’ve said this before,” said Pompeo, the former CIA chief. “If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior, can agree that it’s worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation, then the president said he’s prepared to sit down and have the conversation with them.” Back in May, Pompeo had set 12 conditions for talks with Iran, which were dismissed by Tehran. The remarks drew many remarks from Iranian as well as international politicians. Hamid Aboutalebi, an aide to President Rouhani, said rejoining to the nuclear agreement is the major precondition for possible talks. “Respecting the Iranian nation's rights, reducing hostilities and returning to the nuclear deal are steps that can be taken to pave the bumpy road of talks between Iran and America,” Aboutalebi tweeted. Mohamed ElBaradei, the former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, responded to Trump’s call for talks with Iran, saying, “You cannot renege on a deal considered by all as a keystone, threaten the country, humiliate its leaders and then impulsively call for talks!” Trump’s statements drew responses from the U.S. as well. Former deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman tweeted “Mr. President, Iran just might have a precondition- rejoin the community of nations in support of the JCPOA….” Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran. His move came despite the fact that the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency has released more than ten reports each time confirming that Iran is abiding fully by the terms of the agreement.  NA/PA    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
