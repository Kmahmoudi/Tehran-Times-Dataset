"The visit will further intensify our bilateral relations. Moreover, Belgium is actively supporting the EU's comprehensive dialogue with Iran," Koen Vervaeke, the official spokesman of the Belgian Foreign Ministry, told IRNA. Michel's official visit to Tehran from June 10-13 will be the first by a Belgian foreign minister in ten years on a bilateral level. He visited Tehran as part of EU troika in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the U.S. "It is quite an important visit to Iran," said Vervaeke, adding that the Belgian minister will hold a series of meetings with top Iranian officials. Earlier, Vervaeke told a weekly press briefing Wednesday that Michel will meet President Mohammad Khatami, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and Majlis (Parliament) Speaker Mahdi Karrubi and discuss bilateral ties and international issues. Belgian-Iranian commercial transactions are remarkable. Belgian exports to Iran are valued at around 283 million dollars annually, while Iran is the second-largest exporter of oil from the Middle East to Belgium. Vervaeke said Belgium supports Iran's candidacy for membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Relations between Tehran and Brussels are witnessing a gradual expansion. Belgian Parliament President Hermann de Croo visited Tehran last December to boost bilateral parliamentary relations. a number of Iranian officials have visited Belgian in recent months. Belgian Mminister of Employment, Laurette Onckelinx, is expected to visit Tehran in July. Last month, Belgium and Iran signed a customs cooperation agreement, while the two countries are currently negotiating a bilateral agreement on investment. Belgian-Iranian talks during Michel's visit will also cover consular aspects, such as readmission of refugees. On international issues, Belgium has taken note of Iran's contribution in the fight against global terrorism and in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
