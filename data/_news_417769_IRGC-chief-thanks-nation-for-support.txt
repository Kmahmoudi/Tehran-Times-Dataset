 Assuring the IRGC’s efforts to protect the country against threats, Jafari said the dangers posed by the enemies indicate that boosting defensive capabilities should remain a top priority for the country. He also said Trump’s anxiety and trembling voice in his recent anti-Iran speech was a sign of the beginning of an end to Washington’s hegemonic control. Also, the Guards issued a statement on Thursday announcing that Iran will continue boosting its defensive missile capabilities. The IRGC issues a statement announcing that Iran will continue boosting its defensive missile capabilities. “This people-based institution will continue its ceaseless fight against the hegemony and Zionism more determinedly based on its mission and will take no pause in defending the Islamic Revolution and the country’s national interests,” the statement read. It also said Trump’s “hostile position against Iran” and “imposition of new cruel sanctions on the Guards” show failure of the U.S. and the Zionist regime of Israel’s “devil policies” on disintegrating the regional countries and weakening the Islamic countries.
