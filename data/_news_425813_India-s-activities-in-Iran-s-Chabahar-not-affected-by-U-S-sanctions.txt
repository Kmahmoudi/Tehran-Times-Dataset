TEHRAN - Chairman of Export Promotion Council for India’s EOUs and SEZs (EPCES) said the U.S. sanctions on Iran won’t affect India’s trade activities in Iran’s Chabahar port, IRNA reported on Tuesday. According to Vinay Sharma, the U.S. sanctions include trade and business as well as goods and services sectors while Chabahar port is a communications point for transport. “No sanctions against transportation from Iran to Central Asia are expected to be issued, so the Chabahar project will not be affected by these threats, he added. Mentioning the future of India’s activities in Chabahar port in southeastern Iran, Sharma noted that every nation is seeking to protect its own interests and India does so despite U.S. sanctions. Earlier this month, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh also made it clear that his country’s bilateral relations with Tehran stand on their own and are not influenced by its ties with any third country. The assertion was made as a reply to a question on whether India will continue its economic relations with Iran in terms of both oil imports and investment in Chabahar port in the wake of the U.S. sanctions against the Persian Gulf country. The U.S. has threatened sanctions against countries that fail to cut off trade ties with Iran and stop oil imports.
