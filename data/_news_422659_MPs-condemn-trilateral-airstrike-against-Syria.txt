TEHRAN – In a joint statement, 239 Iranian lawmakers condemned the attack on Syria by the U.S., UK and France, saying the new plots of Western countries will end in failure. The statement was read out at the end of the open meeting of parliament on Sunday, Mehr reported. The Americans, who have backed terrorists in a proxy war against Syria, failed to change the Syrian political system, the MPs said. They fanned the flames of war again at a time when the Syrian crisis was to settle politically, the statement added.
