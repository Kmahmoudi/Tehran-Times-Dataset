TEHRAN – An official with the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) said on Sunday Iran has acquired the know-how to produce stable isotopes, a breakthrough after the country forged a deal with the West over its nuclear program.  Asqar Zare'an, a senior advisor to the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), made the remarks during a ceremony held to launch a semi-industrial unit to produce the raw materials for the production of stable isotopes.
“The homegrown production unit was developed in Isfahan through our young scientists’ self-reliance and great efforts. In addition to our domestic needs, by April 9, 2017, the production unit will be able to produce raw material for the production of stable isotopes, enough for exports to other countries,” he added.
Only a few countries, including Russia and the U.S., have the technology to produce the isotopes, of use mainly in oil, petrochemical, and medical sectors. 
Congratulating the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic’s Leader on the achievement, Zare'an said the initiative indicates that Iran is advancing its nuclear activities according to its needs and in compliance with the international law. 
He went on to say that despite attempts by the world powers, led by the U.S., Iran's nuclear industry will continue to progress.
The announcement came months after the AEOI said it had made preparations for producing stable isotopes.
