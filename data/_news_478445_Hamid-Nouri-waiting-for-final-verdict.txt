TEHRAN- Sweden was set to hold the Iranian national Hamid Nouri's court of appeal on November 7. A Swedish court convicted Hamid Nouri guilty of war crimes and murder on October 24 by which he was given a life sentence. The decision to hold a court of appeal has been denied by Hamid Nouri's attorneys. They have fundamentally questioned the Swedish court's legal validity, asserting that the court deemed itself legitimate to hear the issue without taking into account the limitations inherent in Swedish legislation or the constraints imposed by international law. Based on both Swedish internal law and international law, the application of the international legitimacy of internal courts is subject to requirements and limitations. According to Swedish law, a foreign citizen must willingly enter the country in order to stand trial in Swedish courts on the basis of international legitimacy. Hamid Nouri's attorneys contend that he entered Sweden against his will and under false pretenses. The attorneys stated that the Swedish court did not specify any interest for the Swedish government in its earlier judgment, despite the fact that the Swedish government must have an interest in the execution of international legitimacy.
