TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a top advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, on Monday warned France against making "irrational" remarks, saying the remarks would threaten France’s interests in the region. Velayati said French President Emanuel Macron should avoid following the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump, Fars news agency reported. During a visit to Dubai in November, Macron said he was “very concerned” by Tehran’s missile program after Riyadh claimed it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen and accused Iran of arming Houthi Ansarullah fighters.
