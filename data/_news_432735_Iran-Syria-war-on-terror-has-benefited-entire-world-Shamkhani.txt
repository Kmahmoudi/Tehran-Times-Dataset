TEHRAN - Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said on Tuesday that Iran and Syria will continue cooperation in fighting terrorism.
 “Iran-Syria cooperation in fighting Takfiri terrorism has had undeniable achievements for the region and for the international security and this process will continue” until the security crisis in Syria is resolved, Shamkhani said during a meeting with visiting Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem in Tehran. Shamkhani said that Iran will stand beside Syria in the reconstruction time. “Return of security to Syria is an important opportunity for the country’s development and providing services to the grief-stricken people of Syria, and the Islamic republic of Iran which stood beside Syrian people and government in the war against terrorism it will spare no effort to help and counsel in the reconstruction time,” Shamkhani explained. Elsewhere, he said that enemies of Islam are making efforts to harm the Islamic countries through causing divisions, calling for a united strategy against them. The Iranian security chief also said the Israeli aggressions against the Syrian Army and resistance forces and its repeated violation of the Syrian sovereignty are “unacceptable”, warning that if the Zionist regime does not stop such adventurous moves it will receive a “deterrent and crushing response”. For his part, Muallem praised Iran’s supports for the Syrian government and people. He said that the Syrian government will follow talks with unarmed opposition groups in line with protecting the country’s unity. Zarif highlights necessity of regional unity In a separate meeting with Muallem, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif highlighted the necessity of unity among regional countries. He also said that Israel seeks to undermine security in Syria. For his part, Muallem thanked Iran and said Syria’s victory in fighting terrorism is also a victory for Iran. Zarif also met with new UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen. Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani also met separately with Muallem. Larijani said that the two countries will continue expansion of relations, especially in economic area. The chief Syrian diplomat also said U.S. President Donald Trump is not aware of the Iranians’ determination, predicting that imposition of sanctions against Iran by the U.S. will end in failure. Trump ordered sanctions against Iran in May 2018. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4.
