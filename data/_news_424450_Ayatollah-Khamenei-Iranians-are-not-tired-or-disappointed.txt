TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Friday that the Iranian nation is “not tired or disappointed”.
 Addressing a large number of worshippers who had gathered at the Imam Khomeini Mosallah for Eid-al Fitr prayers, the Leader said those who repeat the words of the enemies by claiming that the nation is “tired and unenthusiastic” are in fact generalizing their own state of mind to others. “They themselves are tried an unenthusiastic,” Ayatollah Khamenei remarked. The Leader cited huge rallies marking the International Quds Day on June 8 as an example of the Iranian nation’ strong will and enthusiasm. Elsewhere in his speech, the Leader said it is expected that the nation be vigilant about the economic plots hatched against the Iranian nation by the enemies. “Today, the main conspiracy of the enemy is ‘economic pressure’ on the masses in order to make them tired and disappointed.” Ayatollah Khamenei called on state bodies and officials to make relentless efforts to neutralize economic pressure against Iran. The Leader said a central council, which includes the heads of the three branches of government and other top officials, has been established to find solutions to economic issues. This council “must take firm decisions and implement them”, Ayatollah Khamenei stressed. The Leader also said, “One of the issues that should be taken seriously by the nation is avoiding a wasteful life”. ‘Israel lacks legitimacy and such a regime will face extinction’ In another event on Friday marking Eid-al-Fitr festivities in which senior officials, ambassadors from Muslim countries and a number of people were present, Ayatollah Khamenei blasted the Zionist regime of Israel for conflicts and friction between Muslim nations in the region. The Leader went on to say that the Zionist regime faces “legitimacy” problem and a regime which has been founded in this way will “definitely” face extinction through the promise of God and the will of Muslim nations.   PA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
