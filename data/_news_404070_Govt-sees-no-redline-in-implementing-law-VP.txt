TEHRAN - Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs Majid Ansari said on Saturday that President Hassan Rouhani and his government have no redline in implementing the law equally for all.

 “… the government seeks to reform the affairs and uphold the people’s rights,” Ansari said in a press conference. He said that President Rouhani has faced the issue of extremely high salaries with “honesty” and “courage”. Rouhani issued a statement on Monday saying that his government will counter corruption and nepotism at the administrative system until it is “eradicated”. The statement by Rouhani followed the revelation of astronomical salaries to certain banking chiefs and an insurance company manager. According to the statement, all bodies are obligated to publish the salaries paid to directors both at military and state levels. Ansari also praised the media’s sensitivity toward inflated salaries. Elsewhere, he said that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is a “document to be proud of”. He cited removal of sanctions and an increase in the country’s interaction with the world as examples of the JCPOA’s achievements. The nuclear agreement was signed between Iran and the 5+1 group (the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany) in July 2015 and went into effect in January 2016.
