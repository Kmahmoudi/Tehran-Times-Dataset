TEHRAN- In a message of congratulations on Syria’s Evacuation Day, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi stated that Iran and Syria’s collaboration and resistance had yielded fruit as they are now reaping the advantages of the new global and regional order. Raisi congratulated his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad on Evacuation Day, which commemorates the evacuation of the last French soldier at the conclusion of the French mandate of Syria in April 1946. Syria declared full independence in 1941. Raisi stated that the global and regional order is turning in favor of Iran and Syria as two free and independent governments that have worked in genuine collaboration and demonstrated historic resistance for years. He also expressed the hope that the development of ties in a number of areas will advance mutual interests and help bring about peace and stability to the region. At a meeting with Syria’s defense minister in Tehran in January, Raisi praised Iran as a staunch ally of Syria, saying that the Islamic Republic will stand by the Syrian people in the same manner that it helped them all through the years that country was grappling with terrorism. President Raisi remarked that Iran-Syria ties are important because they are founded on shared ideals and the resistance spirit of their people.
