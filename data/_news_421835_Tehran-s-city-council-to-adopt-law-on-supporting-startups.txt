TEHRAN – The city council of Tehran plans to pass a comprehensive law on supporting startups in the next [Iranian calendar] year 1397 (March 2018–March 2019), councilor Majid Farahani said. He made the remarks on a sideline event of ‘Smart Tehran Congress 2018’ held in Tehran on March 4-5. Tehran has no regulations on supporting startups, he regretted, adding that a special committee for smartification has been established in the council in this regard. Without providing true support for startups, smartification will not be achieved, he highlighted. Referring to 2.5 trillion rials (nearly $55 million) which has been allocated to smartification in the next years’ budget bill of the city, Farahani described this budget as “not significant”. However, he added, the field of smartification is one of the few fields which will enjoy success in the new urban management.  MAH/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
