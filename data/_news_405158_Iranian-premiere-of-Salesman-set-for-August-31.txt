TEHRAN – Filmiran, the Iranian distributor of Asghar Farhadi’s acclaimed drama “The Salesman”, said on Tuesday that the movie will have its countrywide premiere on August 31. The movie is about Emad (Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidusti) who move into a new flat in the center of Tehran. An incident linked to the previous tenant dramatically changes the young couple’s life. “The Salesman” brought Farhadi the best screenplay award and its star, Shahab Hosseini, the Palme d’or for best actor at the 69th Cannes Film Festival in May.
