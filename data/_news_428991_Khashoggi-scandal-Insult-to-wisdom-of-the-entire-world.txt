The murder of Jamal Khashoggi has proven an extremely huge scandal for the tribal al-Saud family. Probably, worse than the savage murder was repeated denials of the act and contradictory explanations about it.
 The barbaric act was committed by a country that comically claims it is fighting terrorism in the region. Its claim of war against terrorism is like its vehement denial that Khashoggi left the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Those officials in the West who saw Saudi Arabia as a stabilizing force in the region should now be ashamed of themselves.  The murder of Khashoggi has been surely ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salam, also known as MBS. It is an insult to the wisdom of the entire people in the world that the killing had taken place without the knowledge of MBS. In Saudi Arabia, which is being run by a tribal family, a crime of such a degree in a foreign country could not have happened without the order of the dictator at the top. Such acts are trademark of dictatorial regimes, especially Saudi Arabia which is a truly exemplifies tyranny and barbarism. The denial that MBS was unaware of the death is like the great lie that Khashoggi was killed in a “fist fight”. The crown prince is another Saddam Hussein in the 21st century. The only difference between MBS and Saddam Hussein is that the crown prince is being backed more strongly by the West because he signs tremendously lucrative arms agreements with the West, particularly with Trump’s White House who has a greedy eye on Saudi oil money. If Saddam Hussein gassed the Kurdish population in northern Iraq and western Iran, MBS has starved the Yemenis and is killing their schoolchildren. If the West does not come to its senses to withdraw support from the young, inexperienced and wild MBS it should pay a heavy cost in the not too-distant future. Like Saddam who captured the tiny state of Kuwait in 1990, MBS is pursuing the policy by intimidating small neighbors into submission. The sudden siege of Qatar from land, sea and air in June 2017 is a concrete example. MBS would have invaded Qatar to overthrow the ruling system if Doha had not signed a military pact with Turkey. As Trump has covetous eye on Saudi oil money, probably MBS is envious of Qatar’s gas riches. The bullying by MBS has reached a degree that Kuwaitis are also feeling the ghost of another Saddam Hussein. Lebanese researcher Ali Mourad has said Kuwaitis are seriously worried about being invaded. “Kuwaitis need a regional force like Turkey to deal with Saudi ill intentions. They are truly afraid of a Saudi invasion because of a hegemony crisis in the [common] oil fields, Kuwait’s ties with Qatar and the blank check Trump has issued to MBS,” Mourad told Al-Monitor.  Being aware that Saudi Arabia is no match for Iran in terms of military power, MBS is seeking to drag the U.S. into a war with Iran. In regard of these bitter facts if Trump and other leaders in the West do not stop backing MBS, whose country has been pumping extremism in the form of Salafism and Wahhabism to the world, the land of other small countries may be chopped off like Khashoggi’s body.
