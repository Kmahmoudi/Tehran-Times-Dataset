TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Monday that it is essential to overcome economic challenges to protect political independence and national security. 
 “We have adopted right strategies in the region and at the international atmosphere from the political and security point of view, but continuing to apply them is contingent upon enjoying a strong and dynamic economy,” he said during a meeting with Majlis staff. He said that the country is facing challenges in export and domestic production. Abundant foreign commodities in the market have negatively influenced domestic production, he said, calling for serious fight against smuggling. Larijani also said that investment should be facilitated to boost domestic production. Employment and domestic production are interrelated, he noted. NA/PA
