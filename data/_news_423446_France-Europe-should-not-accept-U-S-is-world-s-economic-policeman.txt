French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday that Europe should not accept that the U.S. is the “world’s economic policeman”.
 “Do we want to be vassals who obey decisions taken by the United States while clinging to the hem of their trousers? Or do we want to say we have our economic interests, we consider we will continue to do trade with Iran?” he said on Europe-1 radio. He said that European countries should push back harder against the Trump administration over the Iran nuclear deal and not act as “vassals” to the U.S. Le Maire proposed creating a European body that would have the same kind of powers that the U.S. Justice Department has to punish foreign companies for their trade practices. Donald Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear pact on Tuesday and said he will reinstate economic sanctions on Iran.
