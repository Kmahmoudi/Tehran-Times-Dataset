TEHRAN – The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMCA) is scheduled to organize an exhibition of sculptures by British sculptor Tony Cragg in late October. About 80 sculptures from Cragg’s collections will be showcased during the exhibition, which will run for three months, TMCA director Ali-Mohammad Zare’ told the Persian service of MNA on Monday. Some of the artworks will be selected for display in exhibitions at the Isfahan Museum of Contemporary Art and the Kerman Museum of Contemporary Art. Turner Prize-winning Cragg is known for merging contemporary industrial materials with the suggestion of functional forms from mundane objects and ancient vessels like jars and bottles. One of his famous works is Terris Novalis, an enormous, enigmatic, public steel sculpture of engineering instruments, which was created in 1997. Cragg, 68, is scheduled to attend the opening ceremony of the exhibition. Photo: British sculptor Tony Cragg is seen beside one his works in an undated photo.
