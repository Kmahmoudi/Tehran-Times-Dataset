He also said, “Facilitating banking relations between Iran and Japan can contribute to developing relations and economic cooperation between Tehran and Tokyo.”  Komura also delivered Shinzo Abe’s written message to Rouhani and congratulated him on his re-election as president. “We must attempt to deepen economic and business relations between the two countries more than before in various fields of mutual interest,” Komura pointed out.  ‘No distortions of nuclear agreement must be allowed’  Rouhani also described the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name for the nuclear deal, as an important international agreement, and appreciated Japan's positive role in the negotiations between Iran and P5+1 group. "Today, after the conclusion of the negotiations and the implementation of the JCPOA, we should not let this significant agreement to be distorted and any of the parties to the agreement violate their commitments.” The Islamic Republic of Iran has always lived up to its commitments based on reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Rouhani, adding, "The U.S. government has not fully lived up to its commitments." "The Islamic Republic of Iran will never be the first one to violate the agreement but will respond properly to lack of commitment of the other side," the president asserted. He also said, “Stability and security in the region and East Asia are very important for Iran and we hope that development of cooperation between Iran and Japan contribute to development of stability and security in East and West Asia.” He added, “All issues must be settled through discussion and dialogue and there must not be any threatening and intimidation by another country against others.” In an indirect reference to the rising tension between North Korea and the United States, Rouhani said, “We are against sanctions against countries and we believe that the policy of intimidation of humiliation that the U.S. government has taken up towards other countries will never bear fruit.” He added, “The Islamic Republic of Iran will spare no effort contributing to stability and security in the region.”  He also said that people in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Yemen need help. “Iran is ready to cooperate in transferring Japan's humanitarian help to the people of these countries.” SP/PA
