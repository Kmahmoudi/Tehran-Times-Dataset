TEHRAN – Iran has sent five cargoes of food products to Qatar in recent days and one more will be sent soon, Tasnim reported on Sunday. According to Iran Air spokesman Shahrokh Nooshabadi the cargos each weighing 90 tons contained perishable products.
“We will continue sending such cargos while there is still request from the Qatari side,” the official said.
Three ships loaded with 350 tons of fruit and vegetables were also set to leave an Iranian port for Qatar, the Tasnim news agency quoted a local official as saying.
The port of Dayyer is Iran's closest port to Qatar.
In the biggest diplomatic crisis in the region in years, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, plus Egypt and Yemen, last Monday announced they were cutting all ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting extremism.
The Islamic republic has also opened its airspace to about 100 more Qatari flights a day, after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates banned Qatari planes from their airspace.
The new flights have increased Iranian air traffic by 17 percent. EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
