Turkmen who live in northeastern Iran hold Aq Aash celebration for those who turn 63 in the month of Rabi’ al-awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar.  Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born on Rabi’ al-awwal 17 and lived 63 years, so Muslims mark the prophet’s birth anniversary in Rabi’ al-awwal and Turkmen aged 63 hold the Aq Aash celebration on this occasion.  During the celebration, they serve white soup, which is made with white sheep meat. Most of the foods which are served during the ritual are white. If the host is a man, he puts on white dress and if she is a woman, she wears white chador. Various tribes and ethnic groups who live in different parts of Iran are just like colors, which make a great painting. Iran is home to about 20 ethnic groups who live in different regions of the country. SB/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
