TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani on Monday condemned twin terrorist bombings targeting two Coptic Christian churches in Egypt.
 In a message to Ali Abdel Aal, the speaker of Egypt’s House of Representatives, Larijani said that such terrorist acts are in line with creating religious division. “Terrorism is a threat against all the divine religions and human beings and is contrary to all the values and divine teachings,” Larijani stated. He said such deplorable acts has made close cooperation against the “evil phenomenon [of terrorism] essential”.  The top lawmaker said that the Iranian people stand beside Egyptians in fighting terrorism. The first bombing in Egypt occurred at the St. George’s Church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta, north of the capital Cairo on Sunday and left 28 people killed. The second was outside Saint Mark’s Church in Alexandria, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt, and killed 17 people. The Palm Sunday bombings targeted worshippers celebrating the start of Holy Week. Daesh claimed responsibility for the bombings. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also in phone call with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry condemned the terrorist blasts. Zarif expressed sympathy with the Egyptian government and people over the terrorist attacks. The Egyptian president Abdel-Fatah al Sisi accused unnamed countries of fueling instability in the country, adding "Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt."  Al Sisi added the blasts “will not undermine the resolve and true will of the Egyptian people to counter the forces of evil, but will only harden their determination to move forward on their trajectory to realise security, stability and comprehensive development.”  The president also ordered the immediate deployment of troops to assist police in protecting vital facilities across the country. Pope Francis decried the bombings, expressing "deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation." Word of the attacks came as Francis was holding Palm Sunday services in St. Peter's Square.
