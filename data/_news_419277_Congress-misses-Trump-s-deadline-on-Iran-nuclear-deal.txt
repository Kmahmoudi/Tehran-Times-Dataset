Congress is about to miss what was widely seen as a deadline to deal with U.S. President Trump’s demands for a harder line on the 2015 nuclear deal, failing to agree on new sanctions against Tehran.
 A Republican legislative push to establish new “triggers” that could reimpose harsh sanctions on Iran lifted under the Obama-era deal has gone nowhere ahead of Tuesday — the end of a 60-day unofficial deadline set by the administration for Capitol Hill to weigh in on the situation, The Washington Times reported. Congressional aides say lawmakers still have time to propose something before Trump is mandated to decide again whether to weigh in on the deal, but White House aides say the president is rankled by the lack of progress on Capitol Hill and likely will pull the U.S. out of the deal entirely when it comes up for review on Jan. 13. The nuclear deal was signed between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia - in July 2015. The agreement went into effect in January 2016. In his new Iran strategy declared on October 13, Trump decertified Iran’s compliance to the nuclear deal and asked Congress to decide about the fate of the agreement. Trump said if Congress does nothing he himself will terminate the deal. Contrary to Trump’s claims the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, has issued nine regular reports each time confirming Iran’s adherence to the international deal.
