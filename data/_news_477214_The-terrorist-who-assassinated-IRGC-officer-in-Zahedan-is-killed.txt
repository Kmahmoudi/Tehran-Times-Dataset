TEHRAN — The Tasnim news agency on Saturday confirmed that an assassin who on Friday had martyred an IRGC officer in charge of Sistan-Balouchestan province’s intelligence department has been killed.  Quoting an informed source, Tasnim said, “The assassin of the IRGC general has been killed by the forces serving at the IRGC’s Salman unit in Sistan-Balouchestan.” The commander of the IRGC intelligence department in the southeastern province was martyred after he was shot near the Makki Mosque of Zahedan, the provincial capital. After the eruption of riots in Zahedan on Friday morning, a crowd of anti-revolution agents gathered near the Makki Mosque and started to open fire to innocent civilians. The security forces were immediately deployed to the scene. Nevertheless, the commander of the IRGC intelligence department at Sistan-Balouchestan, Seyed Hamidreza Hashemi, serving under the alias Seyed Ali Mousavi, was shot in the chest and taken to the hospital, a statement by the governor general’s office said. The commander was martyred in the hospital on Friday evening. The riots began on Friday noon, when armed terrorists affiliated with Jeysh ol-Adl attacked three police stations in Zahedan.  They caused panic and fired shots at a police station in the city. Elsewhere in the city, rioters set tires and garbage containers on fire, while armed gunmen stormed a bakery in another region. Moreover, the rioters set fire to a fire truck, an emergency medical service center, and a number of other locations.  The attempts to foment chaos in the city have failed as the security forces brought the situation under control.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
