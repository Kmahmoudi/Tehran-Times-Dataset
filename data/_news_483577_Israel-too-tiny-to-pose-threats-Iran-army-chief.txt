TEHRAN- Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, commander of the Iranian Army, on Monday mocked the notion that the Zionist regime could invade Iran without U.S. assistance, asserting that Israel is too little to even be contemplated as a danger to the Islamic Republic. The top commander made the remarks in response to recent remarks by Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the Israeli military forces, claiming the regime’s preparedness to strike Iran even without assistance from the United States. “We are prepared to take action against Iran,” Halevi boasted on Wednesday, adding, “The Israeli army has the capability to hit both distant and close countries.” In his statement, General Mousavi said such threats are “intended to boost the morale of the Israeli military troops and address the internal issues of the Zionist regime.” The Army chief said, “The Zionist regime is too tiny to be regarded as a danger to the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is floundering and its signs of breakdown have become more apparent than ever.” He also cautioned the Zionist officials that their rash and unwise actions would only hasten the demise of the Israeli regime. “Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of the two sides’ military capabilities would recognize that the Zionist regime’s power may be similar in size to the upgraded scale of one of Iran’s numerous military operations during the eight years of war in the 1980s,” the general concluded.
