TEHRAN – The ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Tehran has asserted the ongoing partnership between Iran and South Korea in business and trade will continue in the next decades. Making the remark on Saturday at a conference on Corporate Social Responsibility and Organizational Culture, Ryu Jeong- Hyun said, “The two countries have been trading partners for decades and are determined to continue the relationship for decades to come.” Ryu hailed the conference and highlighted the importance of business conventions of such for a “sustainable working relationship,” IRNA reported. The South Korean envoy stressed the culture of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in improving the enterprises, calling it an “additional to corporate appraisal.” CSR is a type of international private business self-regulation. “As more companies are engaged in CSR, the more they gain society’s trust,” he noted. Comparing companies with individuals Ryu said, companies are just like individuals with identity and unique personality, and they should feel liable for the environment where they function in. The South Korean envoy went on to say that his government encourages Korean companies to engage in social responsibility in Iran since they believe it is important for both companies and community. Ryu also said that in the past decades CSR has developed and currently covers more businesses and customers and has played a major role in the competition between companies for “sustainable growth”. Calling CSR a “vital diplomatic tool”, Ryu added that although CRS is used in the business world, it can become an important tool in diplomatic relations between governments. “Thus, it requires the backing of governments.”  He also added that many Korean companies are keen on coming to Iran in the coming decades to seek “new opportunities” and reach common objectives with Iran. “I assure you that in our new era, we will look for new opportunities to reach our common goals.”  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
