TEHRAN – The Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, has said that Tehran and Moscow have similar stance on Syria and are working together to help settle the crisis in the country.
 The Russian diplomat said cooperation between Moscow and Tehran in support for the Syrian government has prevented terrorists to achieve their plots.
 
“Terrorists have not achieved success in the region based on such cooperation and we support Bashar al-Assad’s legal government. But of course, what is related to future of Syria should be decided by the Syrian people,” he told ISNA in an interview published on Tuesday. Syria has been fighting with militants backed by certain regional and Western countries since March 2011.  Iran, Russia and Turkey have brokered talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, between the warring sides in Syria in effort to find a solution to the long-running conflict. The new round of the Astana talks will start on May 3. Previous rounds of Astana talks were held in January, February and March.
