TEHRAN- Building the platforms of the remaining phases of Iran’s South Pars gas field, except for phase 11, will be completed by the end of current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019), according to the managing director of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), which is in charge of developing the field. Mohammad Meshkinfam also said the platforms, which are for phases 13, 14, 22, 23 and 24, will be installed on their designated offshore spots by the end of current calendar year or early next year, Shana news agency reported on Sunday. South Pars, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate. The field is divided into 24 standard phases of development in the first stage. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment. Some $72 billion has been invested in the field since starting its development. MA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
