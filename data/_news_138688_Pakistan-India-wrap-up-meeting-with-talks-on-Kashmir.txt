Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said the first session on Tuesday between Indian foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammad Khan went well. The diplomats are conducting the fourth round of talks under a wide-ranging process started by the nuclear-armed rivals in January 2004 after prolonged hostility. The concluding session Wednesday will focus on Kashmir, a Himalayan region split between the two countries and claimed by both in full. The territory has caused two of the three Indo-Pakistani wars since independence in 1947. The two delegation heads were scheduled to hold a joint press conference later in the day to announce the outcome of the meetings, officials said. Officials said the foreign secretaries were to finalize a schedule for future meetings between senior officials on an eight-point agenda. Issues on the agenda include ending a 20-year standoff on the Siachen glacier in Kashmir -- dubbed the world's highest battlefield -- and border demarcation in Sir Creek, a marshy region between southern Pakistan and western India. The peace process has reduced mutual suspicion through steps including cross-border transport links and sporting ties, but it has made little progress on core issues including Kashmir. Tuesday's meetings centered on issues related to peace and security, including confidence-building measures in the nuclear and conventional fields, officials said. The neighbors conducted tit-for-tat atomic weapon tests in May 1998 and still test-fire missiles, while also building up their conventional arsenals. India's Menon called on Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz late Tuesday and briefed him on the progress in talks, a statement from the premier's office said. "The ongoing interaction between Pakistan and India can result in (the) resolution of outstanding disputes between the two countries and change the destiny of South Asia," Aziz said. The talks in Islamabad follow the firebombing of a "Friendship Express" train in India that killed 69 passengers, mostly Pakistanis returning to their homeland. But the two countries did not allow the attack to disrupt the peace process, vowing to boost cooperation in the fight against terrorism and to share information. Menon assured Aziz that India would share with Pakistan the results of its inquiry into the train bombing.
