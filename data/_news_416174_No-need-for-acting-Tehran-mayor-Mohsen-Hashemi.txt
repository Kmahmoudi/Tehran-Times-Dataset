TEHRAN – Moshen Hashemi, the only candidate for chairman of Tehran’s new city council, has said that the 21-member council will not appoint an acting mayor for Tehran. As the council has chosen Mohammad-Ali Najafi for mayor of Tehran, there’s no need to appoint an acting mayor, Hashemi told Tasnim news agency on Tuesday. He added that Najafi will be officially elected as Tehran’s mayor at the same time the council elects its chairman and presiding board. On 10 August, Najafi was unofficially elected as the new mayor of Tehran. MH/SP All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
