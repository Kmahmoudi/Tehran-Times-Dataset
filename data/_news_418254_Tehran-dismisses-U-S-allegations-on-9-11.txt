TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry has dismissed recent falsification of the 9/11 records by the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency to incriminate the Islamic Republic.

 In a late Saturday statement, its spokesman Bahram Qassemi said such a futile propaganda campaign is meant to protect some of Washington’s allies in the Middle East. “The fresh allegations by America and claims against Iran are a clear example of shameless falsification to corroborate remarks by the country’s president and are for consumption inside America,” Qassemi explained. Recently the CIA released a 19-page al-Qaeda report in Arabic, which claimed Iran had supported the extremist group before the 9/11 attacks. The document was part of nearly 47,000 documents recently released by the CIA. The U.S. government's 9/11 Commission has made similar allegations, saying Iranian officials met with al-Qaeda leaders in Sudan in either 1991 or early 1992.  Ignoring the fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks were Saudi nationals, the U.S. government's 9/11 Commission made yet another wild claim, alleging that eight of the hijackers who kept passengers on the hijacked flights under control passed through Iran before arriving in the U.S. Qassemi said U.S officials have yet to comment on these documents, but added that the U.S. government and intelligence agency had a grim record of falsification and deception of world public, even the American people, to achieve their own political and strategic goals. He emphasized that conscientious minds in the international community have no doubt about the U.S. role in creating and ideologically nurturing terrorist groups over the past two decades. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday dismissed U.S. allegations about Iran’s support for the al-Qaeda terror group, describing the claims as an attempt to “whitewash” the truth about the role Washington’s allies had in the September 11 attacks.
