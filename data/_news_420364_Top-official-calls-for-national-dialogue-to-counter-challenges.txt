TEHRAN – Iranian First Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Monday that it is essential to maintain unity and hold national dialogue among rival political factions to counter the U.S. president’s moves who has been working incessantly to undermine Iran’s economic relationship with the outside world.
 “The U.S. seeks to show that (political) atmosphere in Iran is insecure for business. In my opinion, the best thing to do is maintaining unity and holding national dialogue,” Jahangiri said during a conference in Tehran. He said that the U.S. is making efforts to portray Iran as insecure country to do business with, because it is well aware that the main problems the Iranians face today are unemployment and low living standards. To counter such challenges it is needed to create a calm atmosphere inside the country, he suggested. “My solution is to boost unity and integrity and hold national dialogue,” he noted. Jahangiri also said, “Today, the society, government and system are facing various difficulties which can be resolved by all the good opportunities that Iran has.” In recent protest rallies, which were mainly motivated by economic problems including unemployment and corruption, Donald Trump posted frequent tweets inciting violence by the demonstrators.
