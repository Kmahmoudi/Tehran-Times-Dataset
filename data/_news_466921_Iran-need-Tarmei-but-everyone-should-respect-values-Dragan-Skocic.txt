TEHRAN – Iran football team coach Dragan Skocic says that they need their forward Mehdi Taremi but respecting the values are their priority.  The Porto star has been left out of Iran team for two matches against Lebanon and Syria in Group A of the 2022 World Cup qualification. Taremi had criticized Skocic on his Twitter account after the Croatian coach had talked about Iranian players’ tactical weaknesses.  “Mehdi Taremi is a wonderful player but there are values that we have to respect them,” Skocic said in the pre-match news conference. Iran lead the group with 10 points, five points ahead of the Lebanese team. “Two matches against Lebanon and Syria are vital for us. We respect Lebanon and know that it’s not an easy game. They are an organized team and have made job really tough for their opponents so far,” he added. “We are focused on this match and we want to get three points, that’s why we are here. We also know how strong we are. “The National Team belong to all Iranian people not a special player and coach but everyone should respect the values,” Skocic said in response to the controversies about not calling Taremi for two matches.
