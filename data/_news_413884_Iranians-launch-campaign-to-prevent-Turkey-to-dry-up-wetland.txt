TEHRAN – Some 5,000 Iranians have signed a petition that has been sent to UN chief Antonio Guterres, calling on Turkey to stop building dams which dry up the Tigris river in Iraq and consequently Hoor al-Azim wetland in southwestern Iran.

 The petition reads that Turkey “has constructed a tremendous number of dams in the Southern Anatolian region and the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers,” Fars reported on Monday. SP/PA
