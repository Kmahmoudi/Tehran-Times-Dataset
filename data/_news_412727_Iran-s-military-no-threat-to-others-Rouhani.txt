TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that the Iranian military is prepared more than any other time yet it poses no threat against other countries.
 “Today, readiness of the Armed Forces is more than ever but our Armed Forces will be no threat against others,” Rouhani said during a ceremony held to mark Army Day. “The first step of our Armed Forces is not provocation of a military confrontation against any country. Our move is avoiding tension; however, we keep increasing our vigilance against others’ plots and also our pre-emptive power.”  He added, “Our neighbors can be sure that the Armed Forces defend the entire important and sensitive (Persian Gulf) region. The other countries can trust on our Armed Forces which have a deterrent power and not an aggressive ambition.” The remarks by Rouhani came as a reassurance by the Islamic Republic that Tehran is seeking close and friendly ties with southern Arab neighbors.  Certain countries including Britain and the U.S. claim that Iran is a threat to the stability and security of the Persian Gulf Arab states in order to sell more weapons to them.  The president went on to say that certain countries’ armies bring to mind the horror of “intervention in other countries’ affairs”, “genocide” and “coup” while Iran’s army reminds “discipline”, “faith”, “defense” and “move within the framework of law and national interests”. Elsewhere, Rouhani said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s Army has fulfilled its duties as defined by the constitution. Army is duty bound to protect the country’s independence, territorial integrity and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s system.” The Armed Forces protect the national interests and stand beside the people, he added. The president also said that his administration has made any efforts necessary to boost the country’s military capability.
