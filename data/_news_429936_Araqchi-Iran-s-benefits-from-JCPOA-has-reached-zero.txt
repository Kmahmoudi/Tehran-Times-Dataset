Araqchi says the JCPOA is in a very bad situation.He added, “This is a reality that if Iran cannot benefit from the JCPOA this agreement cannot be saved.” Araqchi said with the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, Tehran’s benefits from the lifting of sanctions has “nearly reached zero”. Araqchi said the JCPOA is a “quite balanced” in giving and taking but now this balance has been undermined and “we should cooperate to balance it again”.
