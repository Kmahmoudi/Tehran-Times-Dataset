TEHRAN – Asghar Farhadi’s acclaimed drama “The Salesman” will be screened in the 60th (British Film Institute) BFI London Film Festival running from October 5 to 16, 2016. The film is an entry to the Debate category of the festival in which riveting films that amplify, scrutinize, argue and surprise are shown, organizers have announced on the festival website. The movie is about Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidusti) who move into a new flat in the center of Tehran. An incident linked to the previous tenant dramatically changes the young couple’s life. “The Salesman” scooped the awards for best screenplay, written by Farhadi, and the Palme d’Or for best actor, won by Shahab Hosseini, at the 69th Cannes Film Festival. In addition, Mehrdad Oskui’s “Starless Dreams” is another Iranian entry to the festival. The film will be shown in the documentary competition section of the gala. “Starless Dreams” shows young women in an Iranian juvenile detention center reflecting on the crimes they have committed and the harsh circumstances that have shaped their lives. This year’s festival will screen 193 fiction and 52 documentary features, including 18 world premieres and eight international premieres.
