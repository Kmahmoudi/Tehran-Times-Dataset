TEHRAN- The Islamic Republic would not allow continuous acts of aggression against itself by terrorist organizations based in Iraqi Kurdistan, Iran's foreign minister has told his Iraqi counterpart. During a phone conversation on Thursday with Fuad Hussein, Hossein Amir said, “We will not tolerate the continuation of aggression and terrorist acts by groups that have taken refuge in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and target Iran's national security.” To protect Iran's border, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has struck terrorist strongholds in northern Iraq with drone and artillery. Kurdish militant groups with separatist motivations carry out hit and run operations in west and northwestern Iran by using the Iraqi Kurdistan as a hiding place.   Amir Abdollahian spoke about provocative actions coming from the Kurdistan region of Iraq, adding that they had persisted for forty years despite repeated promises from the local Kurdistan government. “While respecting and adhering to the development of privileged relations between the two countries, as stressed by the high military officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran, we will not tolerate the continuation of aggression and terrorist acts by these groups that have taken refuge in the region and target Iran's national security,” Iran’s top diplomat added.  According to Iranian military authorities, the operations will continue until all separatists and terrorist actions against the Islamic Republic are eliminated. The IRGC attacked their positions near Sidekan, north of Erbil, using numerous rocket launchers, precision-strike weaponry, and drones on Tuesday. Washington announced on September 29 that an American had been killed in Iran's strike on terrorist sites. During their talks, Amir Abdollahian also praised the Iraqi government's efforts to secure the release of an Iranian pilgrim detained in Saudi Arabia. Based on reports from local media, Khalil Dardmand arrived home on Monday via the airway of a Persian Gulf neighboring country. He was detained by Saudi officials during the Hajj journey three months ago. Dardmand was reportedly detained after uploading a photograph of famed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani alongside the Kaaba on his Twitter account. Amir Abdollahian earlier stated that Oman and Iraqi counterparts mediated in efforts to free the Iranian national.
