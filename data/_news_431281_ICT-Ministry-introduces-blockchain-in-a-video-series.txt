TEHRAN – The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Ministry introduces blockchain technology in a series of videos for public. The seven-part video series, which are available on ICT media channel at the Aparat website, aims to give information to public about blockchain as a fundamental section of technology. “Informing public is the principle of using new aspects of technology,” the ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi announced on his Twitter account on Saturday. In early December, a group of blockchain experts from Tehran’s Sharif University of Technology announced that they are developing a startup which is to introduce the first Iranian blockchain-based taxi app. The startup founder Amir Abbas Emami said that they have launched Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The latest report of Europe Union Blockchain Observatory and Forum (EUBF) details that for blockchain to realize its potential within government institutions, they must focus on using the technology to build two things: digital identity systems, and digital versions of their national currencies. “Digital identity is the fundamental building block and a key area for governments to focus on,” the report reads. “Another important building block … is having digital versions of national currencies on the blockchain, for example through blockchain-based central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
