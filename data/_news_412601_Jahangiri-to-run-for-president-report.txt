TEHRAN – Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri will register as a candidate in the next month’s presidential election and will probably challenge President Rouhani, Tasnim news agency quoted sources as saying.
 According to the sources, despite Rouhani’s objection to a candidate from his camp, the reformists have introduced Jahangiri to contest the incumbent president. Sources further said that government spokesman Mohammad Bagher Nobakht will also run for president. Jahangiri and Nobakht have not yet commented on rumors of candidacy. The date for registration will end on Saturday.
