TEHRAN – Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, on Friday condemned Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for their wary on Yemen, saying the two countries have failed to achieve their goals in Yemen despite U.S. support. “Riyadh and Abu Dhabi’s three-year military aggression against Yemen has reached the end of the line,” Amir Abdollahian said in a Twitter message, emphasizing that dialogue is key in resolving the Yemeni conflict, ISNA reported. The situation in Yemen can be resolved only by a Yemeni-Yemeni agreement, he said, warning against any foreign intervention.
