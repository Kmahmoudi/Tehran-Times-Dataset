TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that the people’s demands can be met through coordination among the three branches of government, especially between the administration and the legislature.

 Rouhani said the people’s main demand is resolving economic problems, noting this is the main focus of his administration. One of the main objectives of the nuclear talks was intended to create a “positive change” in the economic situation, he added. “The main objective of the nuclear deal was to create new opportunity for economic activities through removal of sanctions,” Rouhani said during a joint meeting of the administration and parliament. He highlighted the importance of domestic and foreign investment to improve the economy. “All the branches and institutions should stand beside each other to boost economy and provide jobs for the youths,” the president remarked. Commenting on the issue of extremely high salaries of some executives, Rouhani said the issue is not just restricted to one body, suggesting that all bodies should join hands to root out this problem. On June 12, Rouhani wrote a letter to First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri tasking him to pursue the issue of inflated salaries of some executives and fire the ones who had violated the law. Larijani calls for expanding ties with neighbors For his part, Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said “diplomatic moves” related to regional issues should be intensified and relations with neighboring countries should be expanded. Increasing political, cultural and economic relations with the neighboring countries should be a priority, Larijani pointed out. “Relations with the neighbors are the key to problems in the most difficult situation, especially under the current situation that the regional enemies seek to restrict Iran,” he said. Larijani also said, “The country’s situation entails more convergence between the administration and Majlis and the 10th Majlis has this spirit. We should use the opportunities and reduce conflicts among the branches given the situation in the country.” NA/PA          All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
