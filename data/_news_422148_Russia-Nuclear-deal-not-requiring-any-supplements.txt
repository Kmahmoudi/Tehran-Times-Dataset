TEHRAN – The Russian ambassador to the international organizations in Vienna said on Friday that the Iran nuclear deal does not require any supplementary agreements. Mikhail Ulyanov made the remarks after a meeting of political directors of the joint commission between Iran and the 5+1 group. Ulyanov said the nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), should be left intact as it is, since it embodies an extremely fragile balance of interests, TASS reported. “If all the parties concerned suddenly develop a wish to make some additional agreements, which would not be immediately linked to the plan of action and would not be detrimental to it, this will be a matter of their political will and preparedness but still we think there's no need for whatever supplementary agreements today,” he said. “The way I see it, Western countries are alarmed by the Iranian missile program and they are seeking to push it into the framework they would find suitable,” Ulyanov said. “I can only confirm this issue doesn’t have anything to do with the Joint (Comprehensive) Plan of Action.” Representatives of the 5+1 countries and Iran hold meetings in Vienna once in every three months to discuss a whole spectrum of issues related to implementation of the joint plan. Helga Schmidt, the secretary general of the EU foreign policy service, presides at the meetings at the instruction of the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. After Friday’s meeting, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the signatories to the JCPOA should provide the economic and financial conditions for cooperation with Iran. The statement added that the signatories should also cooperate with Iran in its use of peaceful nuclear energy.
