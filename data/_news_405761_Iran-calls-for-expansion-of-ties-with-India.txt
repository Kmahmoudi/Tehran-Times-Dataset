TEHRAN - Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani said on Friday that expansion of security, defense, and cyber cooperation between Iran and India can lay the ground for stronger all-out relations between the two countries.
 “The two countries’ remarkable position in new sciences including nanotechnology, biotechnology, stem cells, and cognition are among likely areas to build upon to expand bilateral cooperation between Tehran and New Delhi,” he said during a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. Shamkhani said that “historic” and “constructive” relations between the two countries have never been a threat against other countries. He also said that cultural cooperation between Iran and India can prevent Takfiri groups from infiltrating into India. Modi, for his part, said that Shamkhani’s visit is an “important” and “valuable” action in expediting implementation of the agreements between the two countries. He also called terrorism and extremism “the most serious threat against humanity,” highlighting the importance of fighting ideological roots of Takfiri terrorism. The Indian prime minister further called for expansion of cooperation in countering terrorism along with expanding ties in areas of politics and economy. The Indian prime minister visited Iran in May during which 12 agreements in areas of economy, business, transportation, culture, science and development of ports were signed. The trip was the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Iran over the past 15 years. The trip by Modi after the implementation of the nuclear deal which removed sanctions against Iran was highly significant.
