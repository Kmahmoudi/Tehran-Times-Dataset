TEHRAN — The Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology succeeded in designing and developing a solar chemical reactor. Replacing fossil fuels with a clean and sustainable energy source is the greatest challenge of our generation. Concentrated solar energy can be harnessed to drive a wide range of chemical reactions, including renewable fuels production.  Recent understanding as to the negative environmental effects from fossil fuels has rekindled interest in renewable energy research. In order to utilize concentrated solar energy for fuels production, materials of construction, reactor designs, and fuel production cycles must be investigated and optimized.  It is possible to use solar light to directly drive industrial chemical reactions and applications, eliminating the need to burn fossil fuels for energy.
