Outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama extended on Friday the national emergency on Iran for another one year, citing continuous threat being posed by Iran to the U.S. even after the 2015 international nuclear deal.  “Irrespective of the JCPOA, which continues to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful, certain actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” read part of the declaration.  “For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2017.”  Tehran has not yet reacted to the extension which comes a week away from President-elect Donald Trump to take office.  Renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act by the Obama administration in Nov. 2016 stirred unremitting debate inside Iran which saw it in breach of the terms of the nuclear deal.  The news comes against a backdrop of optimism over less strained relations between the two countries with more than three decades of reciprocal mistrust and misunderstanding following the successful nuclear pact.
 
A national emergency is subject to automatic termination upon the anniversary of the proclamation unless it is renewed by the incumbent president within a 90-day period prior to the anniversary date by transmitting notice to Congress.  Exercising emergency authorities enabled by the national emergency declaration is not possible provided that they are specified by the president.   Technically, there are two executive orders on Iran declaring states of emergency: order 12957 and order 12170, signed by President Jimmy Carter.  Together, they have frozen Iranian assets held in the United States and have prohibited certain transactions with respect to Iran's petroleum products.  More tensions between the two countries loom large with Trump’s antagonistic statements during the campaign trail.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
