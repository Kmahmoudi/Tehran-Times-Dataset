TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Wednesday that Iran seeks to uproot Takfiri terrorism in the Middle East.
 Speaking in an open session of parliament, Larijani also accused the United States and the Zionists of seeking “to fuel the security crisis in the region.” He also said that the lives of millions of Muslims have been put into danger by the Wahhabi terrorists who are supported by the U.S. and the Zionist regime of Israel. The senior MP added that the U.S. is not firm in fighting terrorism. Pointing to the remarks by Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Larijani said that regional strategies of Iran and the U.S. are in contradiction to each other. During a meeting with head of Iraqi intelligence service Mostafa Kazemi on Tuesday, Larijani said, “Some leaders of Western countries believe that by dividing up other countries, they can overcome their own problems.” “But this idea is absolutely fallacious and we must vigorously defend Iraq’s national unity and territorial integrity,” the parliament speaker noted.
