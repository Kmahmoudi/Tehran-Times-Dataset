TEHRAN – A commemoration ceremony was held in Tehran on Friday for Imad Mughniyah, a senior Hezbollah commander who was martyred by Israeli spy service Mossad in Damascus on Feb. 12 2008. The ceremony was attended by the Quds Force Commander Major General Qassem Soleimani and Ali Akbar Velayati, a top advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution. Speaking at the ceremony, General Soleimani said Mughniyah’s assassination shocked the world and caused a great dismay for the Muslim world. The commander said Mughniyah succeeded to improve the status of Lebanon who was constantly humiliated by Israel. “One of the notable things Imad had done was to raise a society which was constantly beaten up by the enemy into to an elevated place,” Mehr quoted Soleimani as saying. He added many resistance fighters in other countries were inspired by the ideologies of Imad Mughniyah. “Imad was the first to discover an enemy’s drone and receive its images online during the Ansarieh operation,” the Quds Force chief said in reference to Hezbollah’s successful operation against the Israeli aggression in south Lebanon in 1997. Calling Israel a “child killer regime”, Soleimani said today the Zionist regime feels insecure, naming Gaza and Lebanon as two anxiety-inducing points for Israel. The general added, “The person who linked Palestinian groups to the center of resistance and for the first time brought Yasser Arafat to Iran was Imad Mughniyah.” The general also said, “One can see the fingerprint of Imad Mughniyah on every missile that is launched from Palestine into Israel.” Velayati also spoke at the event, expressing the hope that the Zionist regime would soon be annihilated. He pointed to the historic relations between Iran and Sunni Muslims, saying historically Iran was formed during the Safavid dynasty through the help it received from the Lebanese people and prominent figures. The veteran politician also said if it was not for the help of the resistance front, Daesh (ISIL) would have taken Baghdad, Beirut and other major cities.
