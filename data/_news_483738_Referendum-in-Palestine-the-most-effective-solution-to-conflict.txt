TEHRAN – Iranian Ambassador to Tajikistan Mohammad Taghi Saberi underlined that the most effective solution to the Palestinian question is to hold a referendum. Speaking at a ceremony held on the occasion of International Quds Day at the Iranian embassy in Dushanbe, Saberi said, “The crimes committed against the Palestinian nation were a clear and serious violation of international law, human rights, as well as the provisions of the United Nations Charter and UN resolutions. As long as the roots of this crisis and the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people are not addressed, there is no possibility of solving this crisis.” He added, “Quds Day is one of those true manifestations of the unity and cohesion of the Islamic world. al-Quds will remain as the capital of Palestine and the first Qibla of Muslims. We are sure that with the continuation of the struggle of the Muslim people of Palestine and the support of the Islamic world, Palestine will be freed by God's grace and return to the arms of the Islamic world.” Underlining that Quds Day reminds everyone that Palestine and al-Quds belong to all Muslim, Christian and Jewish people of Palestine, he said, “The temporary occupation of the Zionist regime cannot change this fact.”   The ambassador pointed out that the Islamic Republic of Iran, based on its human, national and religious values and international obligations, has always emphasized the need to resolve the Palestinian crisis, according to official news agency IRNA. “The cause of Palestine and the freedom of Holy Quds for Iran is not a tactical approach but a real and strategic political issue. The government and people of Iran will support the rights of the Palestinian people,” he said.  Saberi noted, “In order to resolve the Palestinian crisis, the Islamic Republic of Iran has presented a democratic and fair plan entitled ‘Holding a National Referendum in Palestine’, which has also been registered in the United Nations Secretariat. According to the Islamic Republic of Iran, the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland and the holding of a referendum among the indigenous people of this land to determine the fate and type of political system is the most effective way to resolve this conflict.” He added, “Based on this plan, Muslims, Jews and Christians of Palestinian origin will be able to choose the type of legal system that governs them and benefit from its rights freely and equally. The plan of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been compiled and presented based on democratic principles and international laws accepted by all governments and nations.” The ambassador also congratulated those present at the ceremony and all the Muslims of the world on Eid al-Fitr in advance and expressed hope that “we will soon witness the liberation of Holy Quds and the liberation of the oppressed people of Palestine from the prison of occupation.” Louay Issa, the Palestinian ambassador to Tajikistan, also attended the ceremony. He delivered a speech and spoke about the plight of the Palestinian people under the Israeli occupation.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
