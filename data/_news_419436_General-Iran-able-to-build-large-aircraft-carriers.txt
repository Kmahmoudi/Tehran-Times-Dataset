TEHRAN – A senior Iranian military official on Sunday praised the Navy’s self-sufficiency in manufacturing military hardware, saying the naval forces are capable of building aircraft carriers with a length of 200 meters. Pointing to the Navy’s capability to build destroyers, General Abbas Sadahi said when the Jamaran destroyer was manufactured, the enemies claimed it could not carry out missions and that Iran was not capable of producing such vessels. At the time, only a few countries had the technology used in the destroyer, Tasnim quoted the general as saying.  MH/PA
