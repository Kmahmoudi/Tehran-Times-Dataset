Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the U.S. malign against Iran will reach nowhere. On Monday U.S. President Donald Trump labeled the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. The Leader noted that the U.S. malign acts against Iran will boomerang. “The U.S. and stupid enemies have done whatever they could against the Islamic Republic during the past 40 years, however, they could not do a damn thing,” the Leader said during a meeting with a group of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) personnel and their families. The meeting took place on the eve of IRGC Day. Ayatollah Khamenei added that today the revolution and the Islamic system have become powerful in the world. He said that the IRGC is a “remarkable apparatus” which has been in frontline of countering enemies. Elsewhere, the Leader said since the 1979 Islamic Revolution all the plots against Iran have ended in failure and the country has been progressing unstoppably over these years.  “It has been for 40 years that the enemies have exerted political and economic pressure against the nation, however, they could not do a damn thing even when the Islamic Republic was young,” Ayatollah Khamenei remarked. The Leader said that Iran’s power and dignity are result of the people’s “resistance, sacrifice and insight” and not nuclear weapons which are contrary to religious principles.   NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
