TEHRAN – Iran’s government spokesman said on Tuesday that the country's missile program is not up for negotiation with any foreign power.  “Iran’s missile program is a part of the Islamic Republic’s unchangeable policies,” Mohammad Bagher Nobakht told reporters.  “In the six (five-year) development plan and the current fiscal year (which started on March 21) a strong emphasis has been laid on upgrading defense capabilities,” he added.   On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he hoped newly-elected President Hassan Rouhani will end Tehran's ballistic missile program during his second term.  AK/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
