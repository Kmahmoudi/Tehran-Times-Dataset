TEHRAN – Writing an article in the Washington Post on Sunday, former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt has said Trump’s decision to try to blow up the nuclear deal is nothing less than a massive assault on the sovereignty of others—most notably that of Europe. Criticizing Washington’s behavior towards its European allies, Bildt said, “In a tweet, the new U.S. ambassador to Germany was quick to give orders to German companies on how they should behave.” “This is nothing less than a massive assault on the sovereignty of European states and the European Union... This is utterly unacceptable from a European point of view,” Bildt noted. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
