TEHRAN – Russia’s Ilyushin-20 military aircraft was shot down in western Syria with a Russian S-200 missile by Syrian air defense forces and all 15 crew of the plane were killed. Russia blamed Tel Aviv after authorities figured out what had happened. The Zionists didn’t know the consequences for their action. After the incident, Russia was determined to provide Damascus with the S-300 air defense missile. In line with the issue, Mohammad Maher Mogheh, a Syrian MP, sat with the Mehr News agency to discuss the matter. Q: Following the downing of the Russian plane in Syria, caused indirectly by the Zionist regime, Russia announced the delivery of the S-300 system to Syria. What are the reasons behind this move? A: The announcement of the delivery of the S-300 to Syria by Russia came after a Russian aircraft was downed with 15 servicemen. In fact, equipping Syria with S-300 proves the failure of the Zionist regime to meet the conditions previously agreed upon, conditions that prevented air strikes in the region. Additionally, the accident proves that Russia’s military presence in Syria requires serious air support. Thus, Russia’s delivery of the S-300 to Syria is a strong message to Israel and its allies. The Kremlin showed that it won’t tolerate Zionist regime violations of agreements in Syria. Q: Israel has said that Russia's action is dangerous and will increase tensions in the region. What are possible reactions of Israel and the United States if the Kremlin goes forward the plan? A: Undoubtedly, the Israelis did not expect such a reaction from Russia, and I believe that Tel Aviv will not be able to do much about it. Of course, the Israeli regime will try to prevent Russia from implementing the delivery of the S-300 to Syria, but Russia has made a decisive move and the possibility of changing course is unlikely. There is no doubt that the delivery of the S-300 to the Syrian forces, along with related electronic equipment, added to the already delivered S-200, will create an almost impenetrable air defense zone in the region. It will help Syrians counteract Israeli rocket attacks and fighter planes. This is what Israel and its U.S. allies are afraid of, worried that their plot in the region that is based on supporting the terrorist groups in Syria will fail. The Zionist regime and the U.S. are now trying to stop the Syrian army and its allies from wiping out the terrorist groups in Syria. They want to halt and the revival of Syrian sovereignty over all of its lands. Thus, equipping the Syrian army with armament such as the S-300 will certainly stymie Tel Aviv’s and Washington’s objectives in Syria. I opined that the United States and Israel are not able defeat Russia's move to deliver S-300 to Syria. The objective of the Syrians and Russians, by defeating the terrorist proxies, includes the weakening of Zionist-American power and the continuation of America’s unipolar moment. Q. Will the delivery of the S-300 to Syria change the balance of power in the region? A: Yes, after the delivery of S-300 to Syria, there will be a shift of power in the region and that is exactly what has made Israel and its allies worry, as the shift will strengthen and enhance the ability of the Syrian army and allies in the fight against terrorists who are backed by Israel and the U.S. In the nutshell, the events of recent days and the turbulence, frustration and disappointment of Israel and their supporters over the S-300 reflects the depth of the involvement of Israel and America in the  nearly global struggle that has occurred over Syria for the past eight years. Syria has managed to defeat the plot that could have divided the region further and expanded hostilities in the region.
