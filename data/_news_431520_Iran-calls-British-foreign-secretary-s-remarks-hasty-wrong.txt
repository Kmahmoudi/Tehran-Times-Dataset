TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Saturday slammed British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s remarks against Iran as “hasty” and “wrong”.
 “The British foreign secretary’s hasty and wrong remarks shows his lack of information and are a kind of interference in the internal affairs of an independent country,” he said. In a tweet message on Thursday, Hunt claimed that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, is innocent and must be allowed to come home.  Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, has been imprisoned in Iran for 2 years on charges of trying to orchestrate a soft overthrow of the Islamic Republic. Qassemi said, “The British foreign secretary should take a look at his respected government’s record in the Middle East in past decades and recent years and see human catastrophes and crises for the people of the Middle East caused by the British government’s policies and supports for the terrorist groups.” Pointing to the “people’s catastrophic situation in Yemen, Palestine, Syria” and other places, he said that the British government should be ashamed of providing certain countries with weaponry which has led to this situation.
