TEHRAN - Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Leader of the Islamic Revolution, said on Wednesday that it is a “waste of time” to respond to the insults against Iran by U.S. President Donald Trump.
 “I do not want to spend time to answer the foul-mouthed president of America,” the Leader told a meeting of academics and students. “It is a waste of time that one wants to respond to him.” In a speech on Friday when he announced his new Iran strategy, Trump used an insulting language against Iran and leveled many charges against the Islamic Republic, especially against the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC). The Leader said one should not expect Trump not to be angry against the IRGC which has stood against Daesh which itself is being created by the United States. “As the servant of international Zionism, America is creator of Daesh and the Takfiri current, and then you expect that it would not be angry against a force (IRGC) which has stood against Daesh,” Ayatollah Khamenei noted.   He said that unfounded remarks by U.S. officials indicate their “mental backwardness” regarding issues of Iran and its neighborhood. Iran will not be first to tear JCPOA On Trump’s approach to the nuclear deal, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Tehran will not be the first side to tear the deal, but warned that it will cut the deal into shreds if the U.S. chooses to tear it up. “Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it.” Trump on Friday refused to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The Leader said Europeans need to take practical measures in the face of Washington’s threats to the deal, and refuse to join voices with the U.S. in its opposition to Iran's regional role and defense program. “It is not enough for them (EU) to say that he (Trump) should not tear up the JCPOA. The JCPOA serves their interests,” Ayatollah Khamenei remarked. The Leader also said Europe should “avoid meddling with our defense issues.” SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
