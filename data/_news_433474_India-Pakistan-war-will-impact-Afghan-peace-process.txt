With India and Pakistan on the warpath, Afghan Taliban has also jumped the bandwagon, warning that it could have a bearing on Afghanistan’s peace process. In a statement on Wednesday, the insurgent group said ongoing clashes between India and Pakistan would impact the Afghan peace process and told India to refrain from further military action. “The continuation of such conflict will affect the Afghanistan peace process,” Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement. “India should not carry any further violence in Pakistan because its continuation will affect regional security also the continuation of such conflict will cost a lot to India,” Mujahid said. The statement comes while a delegation of the group headed by top Taliban leader Mullah Baradar holds talks with U.S. officials led by Zalmay Khalilzad in Qatar. The two sides have held a series of talks in recent months in Pakistan, Qatar and UAE without reaching any breakthrough. Many regional countries have also hosted talks with the insurgent group, including Iran, Russia and China. Taliban, which has bases in Pakistan, is allegedly close to the military leadership in Pakistan and would take the side of Pakistan in case of war between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India’s envoy to Kabul Vinay Kumar in a meeting with Afghanistan’s vice president Mohammad Sarwar Danesh on Tuesday expressed New Delhi's support for Afghan government's policies over peace process. Kumar emphasized on an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process, reaffirming India’s support to transparent elections in Afghanistan, said a report in Pajwok News Agency. ‘India-Pakistan war will impact Afghan peace process’ With India and Pakistan on the warpath, Afghan Taliban has also jumped the bandwagon, warning that it could have a bearing on Afghanistan’s peace process.
