Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday that the most part of the Ministry's activities is now focused on the economic issues aiming at pursuing economic policies based on the guidelines of the Supreme Leader.  Zarif made the remarks while addressing Majlis (Parliament) open session where he attended this morning to answer few questions raised by a number of MPs about Foreign Ministry's activities. He said that the major duty of the Foreign Ministry at present time is to coordinate the body's economic activities. Briefing the lawmakers on the political and economic activities of the Iranian embassies in foreign countries, he said that the Foreign Ministry accompanies the state and private sectors' economic delegations during their travels to other countries trying to meet their needs in their meetings with their counterparts in the country of destination. Zarif also added that presently, the talks of the Foreign Ministry officials in other countries are mostly focused on the economic issues. He said that the 'Foreign Ministry is now trying to purposefully follow up objectives of the Economy of Resistance.'  The Economy of Resistance is a term originally introduced by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei in 2010 referring to policies which would lead to the country's economic growth and self-sufficiency based on domestic capacities. Zarif stressed that the Iranian ambassadors in other countries 'have been told that they should not feel concern about their activities abroad as far as they are made in line with the country's interests, serve the country's progress and meet the demands of the public and private sectors in the field of economic activities.' 'The main duty of the deputy foreign minister is now to coordinate economic efforts of the Foreign Ministry,' Zarif stressed. He added that Iran's Foreign Policy is now focused on serving the country's progress, Economy of Resistance, domestic entrepreneurs and economic organizations to attract necessary investment and technology for the country on the one hand, and trying to help exports of technical services and non-oil products on the other hand. 'We believe that the Foreign Policy will serve the national interests when all bodies in the countries cooperate with each other,' the Foreign Minister said in conclusion.
