TEHRAN — Iran is ready to expand medical cooperation with Iraq, Iranian deputy health minister Mohsen Asadi Lari said in a meeting in Iraq with Iraqi Minister of Health Ala Abdessaheb al-Alwan.
 The two sides also exchanged views on medical cooperation at Arba’een pilgrimage (a journey gathering from various nationalities and religions altogether walking towards the holy shrine of Imam Hussein (AS) commemorating the 40th day of his martyrdom in the battle of Karbala), addressing communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as medical tourism.  The Iraqi official, for his part, explained that Iraq is fully committed to expand ties in medical and healthcare fields with Iran, Fars news agency reported on Monday. He also highlighted that current cooperation levels should increase as the two countries have sufficient grounds for greater collaborations. Upon his visit Asadi Lari also invited Minister al-Alwan to visit Iran as well. In late October following a memorandum of understanding inked between Iraq’s Red Crescent Society and Iran’s Red Crescent Society it was announced that a hospital will be jointly built in the Iraqi city of Karbala.
