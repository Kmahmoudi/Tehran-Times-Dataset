The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said the clashes took place after the IRGC ground forces descended on the area, 17 kilometers (10 miles) from the Turkish border, in pursuit of the rebels. According to the IRGC statement, "The Revolutionary Guards besieged these elements and started neutralizing them. In the operation at least 17 counter-revolutionary elements were killed and scores were wounded." It added that the commander of the ground force carrying out the operation had an "accident due to bad weather" while flying by helicopter with eight others to check on the area. The report further noted that the IRGC forces were continuing to clear the region of counter-revolutionary elements. Iran's northwestern West Azarbaijan Province has already been the scene of regular armed clashes between Iranian border guards and Kurdish militant parties, particularly Pejak -- a group linked to Turkey's outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
