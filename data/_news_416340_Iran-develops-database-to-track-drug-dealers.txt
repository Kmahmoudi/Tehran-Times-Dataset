TEHRAN – Brigadier General Ali Moayyedi, the deputy chief of the center for campaign against drugs, said on Sunday that Iran has developed a database to detect and capture drug gang members. During a TV interview on Sunday evening, Moayyedi highlighted the progress in tracking international drug cartels, saying the new database has increased the ability of the police to target the “financial and economic foundations” of the smugglers. Modern tactics have made it possible to track and detect traffickers and criminals, he added.
