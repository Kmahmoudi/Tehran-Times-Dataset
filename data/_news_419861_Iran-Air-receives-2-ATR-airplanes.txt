TEHRAN- Iran’s national flag-carrier Iran Air received two of its ordered twin-engine turboprop purchased from the European plane maker ATR on Saturday, IRNA reported. The two airplanes, which are the 10th and the 11th ones delivered by ATR to Iran, landed on Mehrabad Airport on Saturday morning. Iran Air finalized a deal on the purchase of 20 ATR 72-600 from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer in mid-February.  Iran has paid all the prepayments to ATR. Some 15 to 20 percent of the total $400 million is paid by Iran and the rest is funded via foreign financers. The 70-seat ATR 72-600 is worth $26.8 million at list prices.  HJ/MA
