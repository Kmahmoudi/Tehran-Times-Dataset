TEHRAN – Senior Iranian political and religious figures have condemned a declaration by U.S. President Donald Trump designating a-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of the Zionist regime, saying it endorses the Zionist regime’s continued violation of Palestinian rights. Chairman of Iran's Expediency Council Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi said on Thursday that Trump’s action was “an insult to Islamic sanctities” and called on Muslin nations and countries to unite to counter “such dangerous measure”. On Wednesday, Trump defied overwhelming global opposition by recognizing al-Quds as the capital of Israel and announced plans to relocate the U.S. embassy there. “I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” Trump said. “While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.” Hashemi Shahroudi said the move was a new conspiracy against the Palestinian people’s rights. ‘Foolish move’ Ali Akbar Velayati, a top advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, also denounced Trump’s declaration a “foolish move”. Velayati said al-Quds will remain Palestinian forever. Velayati describes Trump as an “unstable person who is ignorant of political and historical issues”.The veteran politician said the decision, made by an “unstable person who is ignorant of political and historical issues,” is a violation of the Palestinian people’s inalienable rights and a blatant violation of international resolutions. “The move is not acceptable at all. This is another disgrace to the foreign policy of the United States which supports violence and oppression” across the region, noted Velayati, who was Iran’s foreign minister from 1981 to 1997. ‘Al-Quds will remain Arabic and Islamic’ Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif released a statement in Arabic on his Twitter account stating that “al-Quds will remain Arabic and Islamic”. The Iranian Foreign Ministry also issued a statement strongly condemning the decision by Trump, saying it is an “open violation of international resolutions”. 
Ayatollah Mohsen Araki, secretary general of the World Forum for Proximity of Islamic Schools of Thought, said the decision would lead to a new intifada, urging all Muslim countries to support Palestinians. “We see this bid as a sign that [the lives of] the government of America and the Zionist regime are nearing their ends,” Ayatollah Araki said. Tehran Friday prayer leader Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami spoke out against the move as well. Addressing worshippers, Ayatollah Khatami said the U.S. as a “hegemonic power” has supported the occupation since the Palestinian lands were occupied by the Zionists nearly 70 years ago. “Today, both Democrats and Republicans support this brutal occupation and America’s recent decision adds to this,” he said. He said not only the Muslim world, but also all the countries across the world should oppose this blatant aggression against Palestinian people’s rights. The cleric emphasized that even the United States’ allies have condemned Trump’s move, “but [paying lip service] is not enough.” ‘Big strategic mistake’ Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli described Trump’s move as a “big strategic mistake”. “The Zionist regime and America are responsible for increasing tensions in the region and al-Quds,” he added. According to Mohammad Reza Tabesh, a senior reformist lawmaker, the decision can turn regional disputes into a world war.  Tabesh urged leaders of Muslim countries to take actions to oppose recognition of al-Quds as Israel’s capital. ‘Playing with fire’ Prominent Sunni cleric Molavi Abdolhamid Esmaeil Zehi said the move was an “insult” to the Muslim world and was like “playing with fire”. He also urged Muslims to learn lessons from “Trump’s treasons and lies”.
