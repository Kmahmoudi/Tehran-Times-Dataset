TEHRAN – Yemen’s former President Ali Abdullah Saleh has said there are no Iranians fighting in Yemen, ISNA reported on Monday, citing Russia Today. “Saudi Arabia should take its fight against Iran outside Yemen,” Saleh said, questioning Riyadh’s military campaign against Yemeni civilians which has so far killed thousands of civilians, including women and children. “Show us one Iranian who has been captured or killed [in Yemen] and we will accept responsibility,” he said. “Show us one missile which had been made in Iran.” MH/PA
