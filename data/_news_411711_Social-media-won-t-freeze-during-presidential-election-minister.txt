TEHRAN — Social media in Iran won’t freeze during presidential election, due in May 2017, the ICT minister said in an interview with the Iran newspaper published on Monday. It’s unlikely that anybody disagrees with taking advantage of social media, Mahmoud Vaezi said. “All parties should respect public opinion. We can’t dictate people which media to trust.” Elsewhere in his remarks, Vaezi highlighted that the facility needed for electronic voting in 10,000 polling stations is in place. SP/PA
