TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi condemned on Saturday a suicide attack on a mosque in Pakistan which left at least 25 people killed and tens of others injured.
 “It is the time for the regional countries to get determined in serious fight against the roots of terrorism and overt and covert factors behind it through awareness and unity and rid the world of this century’s blight,” he said. Qassemi also offered the Pakistani government and people, particularly the families of victims, condolences and expressed sympathy with them. Jamaat-ul-Ahra, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, has claimed responsibility for the bombing. According to CNN, the attack took place at one of the biggest mosques in Mohmand Agency, a district in Federally Administered Tribal Areas north of Peshawar. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif strongly condemned the attack in a statement. “The cowardly attacks by terrorists cannot shatter the government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country,” he said. Jamaat-ul-Ahra has carried out several major attacks in Pakistan this year, including a bombing on August 8 that targeted lawyers and journalists and killed more than 72 people.
