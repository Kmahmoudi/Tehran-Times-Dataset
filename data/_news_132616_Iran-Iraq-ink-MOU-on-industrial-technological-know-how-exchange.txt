The agreements were signed between Iran's Ministry of Education and Ministry of Industries and Mines with the relevant Iraqi ministers on the last day of the visit of the Iraqi president to Tehran. Ministers from the two countries signed the MOUs in presence of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his Iraqi counterpart Jalal Talabani. Talabani has earlier been to Iran after the downfall of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and the establishment of a new government in the country. As head of the Iraqi transitional government, Talabani paid his second visit to Iran on November 21, 2005 at the head of a politico-economic delegation. Iran and Iraq have expanded ties and cooperation in various fields in recent years. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on promoting political and economic ties and the reconstruction of Iraq during a visit by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to Tehran in September.
