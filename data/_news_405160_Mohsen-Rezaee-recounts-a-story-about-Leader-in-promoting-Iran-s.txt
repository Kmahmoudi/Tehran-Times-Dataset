TEHRAN - The secretary of the Expediency Council, Mohsen Rezaee, shared a photo of the Supreme Leader on Monday, recounting a story about the role the Leader played in strengthening Iran’s political status in the world.
 Here’s the full account of what he wrote on his Instagram account: “In the final years of Mr. Hashemi’s government, the European ambassadors packed their bags and left. Some of us were frightened and were seeking a solution.
In the meantime, with my brothers in the IRGC, we were holding a massive military drill in Bandar Abbas and the Strait of Hormuz. The presence of the Leader of the revolution made the drill much more glorious and sent a powerful message to the world.
A few days later, the ambassadors once again packed their bags and returned to Iran.”
