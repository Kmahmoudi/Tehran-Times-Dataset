Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz says Warsaw opposes any EU actions that would weaken U.S. sanctions against Iran, as the EU continues to look for ways to preserve the nuclear agreement after U.S. withdrawal. According to the Associated Press, Czaputowicz said encouraging the continued operation of European companies in Iran could weaken U.S. sanctions, and this could become be a big problem. He said that those “states that tie their security to United States security” shared views similar to Poland’s given their interest in preserving their trans-Atlantic relationship.
