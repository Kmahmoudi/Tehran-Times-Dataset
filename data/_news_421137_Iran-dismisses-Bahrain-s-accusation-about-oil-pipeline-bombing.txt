TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Thursday vehemently rejected Bahrain’s accusations of links between Tehran and a number of suspects in a 2017 bombing targeting an oil pipeline in the Arab sheikhdom in the Persian Gulf. Qassemi said the Manama regime’s fresh accusations are “fabricated and baseless,” calling on the Bahraini rulers to stop the “awkward and delusional blame game” against Iranian institutions, Press TV reported.   “Instead of making repeated allegations and outdated scenarios, the Bahraini officials had better abandon [their] security-policing approach in suppressing the legitimate demands of the people and put an end to the crisis in the country through serious dialogue,” he said in a statement  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
