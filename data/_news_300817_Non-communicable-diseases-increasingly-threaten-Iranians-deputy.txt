TEHRAN — Non-communicable diseases are growing to threaten the health of Iranians, the deputy health minister Ali-Akbar Sayyari said on Friday. 70 percent of deaths are the unfortunate result of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart attack, asthma, and respiratory conditions, IRNA news agency quoted Sayyari as saying. Almost all these conditions are rooted in lack of movement, smoking, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, unhealthy diet, and drinking, he explained. Sayyari regretted the fact that annually some 10 trillion rials (nearly $3 billion) is being spent on smoking which is one of the leading causes of various diseases. Salt and sugar consumption can also cause high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol, he said, adding, five million Iranians suffer from diabetes, 15 million from high cholesterol and 10 million from high blood pressure. Sayyari went on to say that currently there are 422 million people who have diabetes worldwide of whom half don’t know they have it and additionally 83 percent of the people die of high blood pressure. Every 20 seconds one leg is being amputated as a result of diabetes though one can prevent such a catastrophe by taking the self-care measures, he added. The average amount of sugar intake is 25 grams per day while there is 30 grams of sugar in one bottle of cola, he warned, noting, in Iran people consume some 65 grams of sugar per day on average. He further commented on the amount of salt Iranians consume as being 10 to 12 grams per day whereas normally for those who are under 50 years 5 grams and those above 50 only 3 grams of salt is recommended. Taking less than 500 kilocalories each day and 30-minute walk on a daily basis would help to lose 500 grams per week, he suggested.
