TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Tuesday that it is necessary that countries in the Eurasia region also fight terrorism and address other common challenges.
 Fighting terrorism, extremism, violence and countering unilateral sanctions that influence free international economic relations can lay the groundwork for multilateral cooperation among the Eurasian countries, Larijani said during a speech at the meeting of the parliament speakers of Eurasian countries in Seoul, South Korea. Describing terrorism as an “international threat”, he said fight against the terrorist groups entails identifying and countering roots of their ideology and their supporters. Larijani also said the strategy of the U.S. is “playing with terrorism” rather than fighting it. Commenting on the Syrian crisis, the senior lawmaker said that the situation in the country has become more complicated due to foreign interferences. “The Islamic Republic of Iran supports the Syrian government’s actions in fighting terrorist groups and highlights the importance of the Syrian people’s role in determining the country’s political structure and finding political solution to the conflict,” the parliament speaker stated. He added it is essential that the international community help restore peace and security in Syria. The Iranian parliament speaker also said applying military strategy to resolve the Yemeni crisis is “fruitless”, renewing Iran’s call for inter-Yemeni talks in order to bring the war to a halt in the country. To reinstate deposed Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi as president, Saudi Arabia has been pounding Yemen incessantly since March 2015, causing great damages to the country’s infrastructure and pushing millions of people to the verge extreme starvation.  ‘U.S. sanctions violate international law’ Larijani also said that the U.S. moves in imposing unilateral sanctions against independent countries violate international law and the UN Charter. On 15 June, the U.S. Senate voted nearly unanimously for legislation to impose new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile activity, its alleged human rights violation and claims of support for terrorist organizations.
