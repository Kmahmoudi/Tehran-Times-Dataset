TEHRAN - Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran has said a decision by Saudi Arabia to join the U.S. in sanctioning Lebanese Hezbollah officials while Israel is ruthlessly massacring Palestinians is “shame upon shame”.
 “Israeli snipers shoot over 2,000 unarmed Palestinian protesters on a single day. Saudi response, on eve of #Ramadhan? Collaboration with its U.S. patron to sanction the first force to liberate Arab territory and shatter the myth of Israeli invincibility. Shame upon shame,” Zarif tweeted on Wednesday.
