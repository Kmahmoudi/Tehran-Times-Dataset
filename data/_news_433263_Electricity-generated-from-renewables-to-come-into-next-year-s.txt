TEHRAN – Iran plans to diversify its energy exports in the next Iranian calendar year (begins on March 21, 2019), adding electricity generated from renewable sources to the export backset, IRIB reported on Thursday quoting an energy official. According to Seyed Mohammad Sadeqzadeh, the head of Iran’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (known as SATBA), currently there are 700 megawatts (MW) capacity of renewable power plants installed across the country. Underlining the country’s great potential for increasing its renewable output, the official noted that the figure will exceed 1000MW by the end of the current Iranian year. Earlier in August 2018, Sadeqzadeh said that the country’s total capacity of generating electricity from renewable resources will reach 1100 MW by the end of the current Iranian calendar year. Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence in the regional electricity market.
