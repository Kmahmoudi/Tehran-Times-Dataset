TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani officially inaugurated the first phase of Persian Gulf Star Refinery in the southern province of Hormozgan on Sunday. A handful of high-ranking officials including Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company Managing Director Abbas Kazemi accompanied the president in the inauguration ceremony, Shana reported. The first phase of the project is intended to produce 12 million liters of Euro-4 gasoline, 4.5 million liters of gas oil, one million liter of kerosene and 1.3 million liters of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) per day. Once fully operational, the refinery will add over 36 million liters of Euro-4 and Euro-5 quality gasoline to the country’s gasoline production capacity to increase it to 100 million liters per day. The two remained phases of the gas condensate refinery will also come on stream within two six-month intervals. The refinery is the first of its kind designed based on the gas condensate feedstock to run with the capacity to produce 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) of the product. The facility is fed by gas condensate recovered from South Pars gas field which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf. EF/MA
