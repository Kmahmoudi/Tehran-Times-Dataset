TEHRAN- In response to anti-Iran remarks by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, the Iranian Foreign Ministry has summoned Australia's ambassador to Tehran. The Australian prime minister's “misguided policy will not improve bilateral relations," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani stated on Wednesday. The relevant warnings were conveyed to the Australian ambassador, he added. “It seems that the Prime Minister of Australia has taken a wrong-headed approach based on false information, which does not help the relations between the two countries,” he pointed out. Kanaani further stated that Iran is prepared to give the Australian government the accurate account of events in Iran, free from media turmoil. In a previous statement, Albanese had criticized the Iranian government in public and urged Tehran to "respect human rights and the freedom of people to peacefully protest." After Mahsa Amini's death, riots erupted in certain cities in Iran in the middle of September. The 22-year-old lost consciousness inside a Tehran police station and was declared dead three days later in hospital. Based on an official report by Iran's Forensic Medicine Organization, she died from chronic sickness rather than suspected head trauma or injuries to other critical body parts. Western countries, notably the United States, supported the rioters as they went on the rampage, viciously killing and wounding security personnel. Kanaani added that the best approach to avoid misunderstanding in diplomacy is mutual respect and reliance on the truth. “Australia lacks the least moral legitimacy to preach about human rights, given its human rights record which is full of challenges, from the murder of refugees to the murder of 500 aboriginals in the country’s prisons and the prohibition of professional research in these cases,” he remarked. The spokesman concluded that the Australian government's double standards on human rights is demonstrated by its protection of terrorist and separatist organizations and by its failure to denounce the last month’s terrible terrorist attack on Shah Cheragh, a sacred site in Shiraz.
