TEHRAN – The Iranian defense minister has said Tehran will keep upgrading its deterrent capability, not yielding to the enemy’s media hype.
  Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan made the remarks as eight overhauled and manufactured helicopters entered service. “The upward trend in the country’s defense capability and deterrent power is underway in all defense industries and this will not be influenced by the enemies’ psycho war and media hype,” Dehqan pointed out. The remarks come amid news about the country taking delivery of the first missile batch of the S-300 air defense system. Also, the remarks come one day after the UN Security Council briefing on the first report of the secretary-general on the implementation of resolution 2231 which was adopted immediately after the conclusion of the nuclear deal between Iran and great powers in July 2105. The report voiced concern at Iran’s missile program, which Tehran insists is for sheer deterrence. While warning Iran against ballistic missile launches, the report quoted UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon as having said that such tests “have the potential to increase tensions in the region.” In early March 2016, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) test-fired a series of ballistic missiles during military exercises. A leaked copy of Ban’s report seen by Reuters already drew Tehran’s ferocious objection. “Mr. Zarif had a very stormy telephone conversation (on June 29) with Mr. Ban Ki-moon” after studying the draft, said Deputy Foreign Minister Araqchi.
