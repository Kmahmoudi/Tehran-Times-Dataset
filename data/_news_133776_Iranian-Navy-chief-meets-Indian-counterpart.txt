The two sides discussed the bilateral, regional and international security issues. The Iranian Navy chief who arrived in New Delhi Sunday evening for a six-day official visit to India, laid a wreath at the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the India Gate memorial. The Amar Jawan Jyoti is an eternal flame lighting in the memories of those Indian armed forces personnel who have laid down their lives in operations since the World War I. Paying respect to them, the visiting Naval Chief also signed in the memorial book. In his exclusive interview with IRNA, Rear Admiral Sajjad Kuchaki expressed hope that his talks with Indian Defense Minister and top brass of military establishment including chiefs of army, navy and air force as well as his trip to Ports and other Navy facilities in the eastern and western India will help in strengthening the ties between the naval forces of two countries. Elaborating on the aims of his six-day visit, Rear Admiral Kuchaki said that some parts of the protocol signed between the defense ministers of India and Iran four years ago are to be finalized. One of the important aims of this visit is to implement various clauses of the protocol signed between the two countries four years ago for cooperation in the field of training and defense, Khuchaki added. Regarding the contents of the protocol, Rear Admiral Kuchaki said the formation of expert groups to work out deployment of naval forces in the Oman Sea and Indian Ocean, cooperation to check threats and terrorism and exchange of experiences, expertise and technology between the naval forces of India and Iran are parts of the protocol. On establishment of a search and rescue center by the two countries' naval forces, the Iranian naval chief said he would discuss the issue with Indian naval officials. It could be set up in Chabahar region, southern Iran, or in India to help submarines whenever the need arises, Rear Admiral Kuchaki added.
