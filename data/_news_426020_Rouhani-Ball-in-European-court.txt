TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that it is “very important” for Iran that the European Union take a “transparent” step toward the 2015 nuclear agreement now that the U.S. has left the multilateral deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 “Today, we are at a very critical juncture regarding the JCPOA, and Europe’s transparent expression of its position on actions (that it will take) after the U.S. illegal withdrawal is very important for the Iranian nation,” Rouhani said in a meeting with Rob Macaire, the new British ambassador to Tehran. Rouhani, who received Ambassador Macaire’s credentials, said the “ball is now in Europe’s court”. Elsewhere, Rouhani said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought tension in the region and is not seeking to cause any problem in the international waterways, however we will never abandon our right to export oil.” Rouhani says, “The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought tension in the region and is not seeking to cause any problem in the international waterways, however we will never abandon our right to export oil.”For his part, Macaire said that the British government supports continued implementation of the nuclear deal.
