TEHRAN - The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) is reportedly going to hire Iran current coach Carlos Queiroz.  According to Youm7.com, EFA president Hany Abo Rid is reviewing the options to find a new coach for the Pharaohs. Hector Cuper has left his role after failing to pick up a point in the World Cup group stage. Cuper's team finished bottom of Group A and was the first in the tournament to be eliminated. The North African nation lost to Uruguay, Russia and then Saudi Arabia. Contrary to the Argentine coach, Iran earned four points under Queiroz in tough Group B. Team Melli edged past Morocco 1-0, lost to Spain 1-0 and drew 1-1 with Ronaldo-spirited Portugal. Queiroz has yet to agree to extend his stay as Team Melli coach despite claims by the president of the country's football federation that the Portuguese would lead the team at January's Asian Cup finals. The ex-Real Madrid coach has been also linked with a move to South Africa and Algeria. Morocco coach Herve Renard and Australia coach Bert van Marwijk are also on EFAâ€™s radar.
