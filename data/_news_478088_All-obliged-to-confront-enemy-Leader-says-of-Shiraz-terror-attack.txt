TEHRAN – Following a terrorist attack on pilgrims in the Shah Cheraq shrine in Shiraz on Wednesday evening in which 13 people, including three children, were martyred and about 30 other wounded, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei issued a message stating that all have the duty to confront the warmongering enemy. “The heinous crime that took place in the holy shrine of Ahmad ibn Musa (PBUH) and led to the martyrdom and injury of tens of innocent men, women, and children saddened and grieved our hearts. The perpetrator or perpetrators of this heinous crime will surely be punished. But their loved ones' pain and the desecration of the Ahl al-Bayt's shrine (PBUH) will not be compensated for except by searching for the roots of these tragedies and taking decisive, wise action about them,” the Leader said in his message released on Thursday morning. “All have duties in confronting the warmongering enemy and its traitorous or ignorant, negligent agents. From those in security and justice to all our dear people, all must be unified against a trend that condones disregarding and disrespecting people's lives, security and sanctities. The dear Iranian nation and the responsible sectors will definitely prevail against the criminal conspiracies of the enemies, God willing,” he added. He then expressed his condolences to the bereaved families, to the people of Shiraz and to all Iranians and asked Almighty God for the quick recovery of the injured.
