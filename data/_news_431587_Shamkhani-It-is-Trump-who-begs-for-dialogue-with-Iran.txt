TEHRAN - Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, announced on Monday that the U.S. requested talks with Iran for two times during his recent visit to Afghanistan.
 “In my recent visit to Afghanistan, the U.S. sent me two messages for talks, and the claim that we send message asking for negotiation is a lie,” the security chief told the conference of defense and security in West Asia hosted by Supreme National Defense University. He noted that Iranians do not hold talks with an “illogical” person. Speaking to reporters at the White House on January 6, President Donald Trump claimed that Iran is not doing well and wants to hold talks with the U.S. In a press conference at the White House on July 30, Trump said he would meet with Iran “anytime they want to” and without “preconditions”. In remarks on August 13, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there will be no war between Iran and the U.S. and nor will be any negotiation between the two countries. The Leader noted that negotiation with the current U.S. administration is impossible. “Even if we were to negotiate with the U.S., we would never hold talks with the current U.S. administration.” ‘No country can trust U.S.’ Shamkhani told reporters after the conference that no country can trust Washington and hold talks with it. “With its current characteristics, no country can hold talks with the U.S.,” the top security official remarked. It has been proved that the U.S. cannot be trusted, he added. ‘Trump just voicing his impossible dreams’ Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday that Trump is merely voicing his “impossible dreams”. “Trump is merely voicing his impossible and void dreams, which are not connected to realities. He knows that the Islamic Republic has for decades been facing U.S. pressure and sanctions policies,” the Foreign Ministry’s website quoted him as saying. He added, “Delusions and hostile moves by the U.S. have so far led nowhere, despite all their hateful efforts, and this will continue in the future.” He noted that the Iranian people will never give in to the U.S. pressure.
