TEHRAN – A symbolic court in Iran has respectively sentenced Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing to 25 and 15 years in jail for ethnic cleansing against Rohingya Muslims. During the symbolic court held at Imam Sadiq University in Tehran on Tuesday, a number of Muslim rights activists from Iran and Bangladesh as plaintiffs accused the two leaders of human rights abuses against the Rohingya, Tasnim reported. The sentences come as Myanmar’s troops have intensified attacks against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, home to over a million members of the desperate minority, since October 2016.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
