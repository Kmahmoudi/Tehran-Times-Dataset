TEHRAN – The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) is ready to accelerate its uranium enrichment work, but hoping that such decision would not be necessary, AEOI chief Ali Akbar Salehi said on Tuesday. “We have the capacity to restore [enrichment program] but hope we’ll never reach that point, because the country’s nuclear industry is moving toward its commercial purposes smoothly and without any problems,” Salehi said on Tuesday, Mehr reported. Under the nuclear agreement, Iran stopped enriching uranium to the purity of 20 percent and gave up the majority of its fuel stockpile as part of the agreement.
