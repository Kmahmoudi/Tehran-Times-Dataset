TEHRAN – Establishing an appropriate academic ecosystem based on the private sector can develop research projects, the vice president for science and technology Sourena Sattari said on Monday, IRNA reported. The government budget is not sufficient for research projects, he said. The universities are responsible for development of economy in the country, he said. The universities should overcome complicated bureaucratic systems as well as oil economy in Iran, he explained. He named practical productions as the main factor for development of academic-based economy. Moreover, the knowledge-based companies and startups can solve many problems in the society, he added. He named private sector as an important factor which can turn the firm identity of research into industrial one. The lack of right ecosystem in research lead to immigration of talented university students to other countries, he said. Universities should acknowledge interdisciplinary subjects and researches with synergy amongst different fields, he concluded.  SB/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
