TEHRAN — Iran unveiled on Saturday a domestically produced airborne firefighting system that can be loaded to various aircrafts for extinguishing large-scale fires.   The system allows aircrafts to be used as an air tanker to combat fire as it can carry about 18 tons of water and spray it every five seconds, YJC reported.  Forests in Iran are prone to fire outbreaks and such equipment would help in containing destructive flames much more effectively.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
