TEHRAN â€” Bandages for patients suffering Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is charge free in Iran since last Iranian calendar month, starting June 21, the Food and Drug Administration director, Rasoul Dinarvand, has said. He assured the patients that the bandage supply would not be temporary and that they would be distributed among the patients with the EB house being in charge of the dispensation of the wound care products. Moreover, Dinarvand pointed that some 50 billion rials (nearly $1.5m) is allocated to provision of other needs of EB patients such as food supplements and ointment in addition to the bandages. EB is a group of inherited connective tissue diseases that cause blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes. It is a result of a defect in anchoring between the epidermis and dermis, resulting in friction and skin fragility. Its severity ranges from mild to lethal.
