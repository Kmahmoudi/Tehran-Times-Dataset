TEHRAN- Khuzestan's police chief announced on Saturday that intelligence and security personnel have apprehended a person who was smuggling a cargo of weapons. The security forces were closely watching the smuggler who delivered the weaponry to Ahvaz, the provincial capital, according to Brigadier General Mohammad Salehi. In cooperation with legal officials, the operation in Ahvaz resulted in the successful arrest of the smuggler. “A Colt, 1,850 Kalashnikov cartridges, 50 Colt cartridges, and eight magazines were also taken from the smuggler's car,” Salehi added. He highlighted that police had a "redline" regarding public safety and pledged a firm response to anyone attempting to jeopardize national security. The Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) located and destroyed a terrorist group supported by a European nation in the city of Ahvaz earlier this month. An informed intelligence source maintained that confessions by the members of the group had revealed their intentions to "assassinate a number of Arab persons and figures in Khuzestan."
