TEHRAN – Iran international winger Alireza Jahanbakhsh joined Brighton and Hove Albion on a five-year contract from Dutch side AZ Alkmaar for a club-record fee on Wednesday. Financial terms were not disclosed but British media reported Brighton agreed on a deal worth £17 million ($22.36m) for Jahanbakhsh. "Ali is a player that we have been aware of and monitored for a few years, and his versatility will increase our attacking options within the squad," Brighton coach Chris Hughton said in a statement. "He can play in a wide position or central midfield attacking role, and I am now very much looking forward to working with him." Leicester City were also looking to sign the player. Jahanbakhsh represented Team Melli in the 2018 World Cup. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
