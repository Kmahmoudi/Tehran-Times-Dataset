TEHRAN - British ambassador to Tehran said [despite Washington withdrawal from Iran’s nuclear deal] the government of Britain supports British companies which are interested in activity in Iran, Shana reported. Rob Macaire made the remarks during a ceremony for signing a Head of Agreement (HOA) between National Iranian South Oil Company (NISOC) and London-based Pergas consortium in Tehran on Wednesday for developing Iran’s Keranj oilfield. “We are strongly committed to the JCPOA and the British government is seeking solutions to secure all sides’ interests in the nuclear deal,” the official said. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, NISOC Managing Director Bijan Alipour, Robert Macaire, and Pergas Managing Director Colin Rowley were among the attendees of the signing ceremony. Based on the signed agreement, the consortium will aim to produce 655 million barrels of oil from the Keranj field in Khuzestan province, southwest Iran, over the next 10 years. The project is estimated to cost $1.3 billion to be completed. During the event, Zanganeh said Tehran is going to take necessary measures to maintain its oil production and exports at current levels. Keranj oilfield is estimated to have 11 billion barrels of in-situ oil in Asmari and Pabadeh reservoirs. The field is currently producing over 120,000 barrels per day of oil.
