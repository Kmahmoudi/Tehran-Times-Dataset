TEHRAN – Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday that US President Donald Trump’s reaction to murderous attacks in Tehran was “repugnant” as Iranians were hit by U.S. clients. “Repugnant WH [White House] statement... as Iranians counter terror backed by US clients,” Zarif tweeted. Zarif was making the comment in response to Trump’s comment that “states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote”. Sixteen people were killed and more 40 injured in the attacks on Tehran’s parliament complex and the shrine of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the first claimed by Isis in Iran. Trump has long accused Iran of backing terrorism and has threatened to tear up a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers. Iranian security officials counter that it is their regional rival Saudi Arabia – a close U.S. ally – that is responsible for funding and spreading the extremism that underpins Isis. Trump’s comments also brought criticism from Iranians on social media, who recalled their government’s offers of support and the candlelight vigils held in Iran after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.
