TEHRAN – A week has passed since Iran football failed to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage but the Federation has remained silent so far. The football federation faced criticism for changing Team Melli coaching staff just two months ahead of the World Cup but they defended their decision and finally hired Carlos Queiroz as new head coach of Iran football. Under leadership of the Portuguese coach, Iran football failed to meet expectations but any member of the federation has not talked about the National Team so far. Iran had a golden chance in Qatar to qualify for the next round for the first time ever but missed that due to mismanagement. Ehsan Osouli, the spokesperson of Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran (FFIRI), must speak about what the Team have done in Qatar. Nobody knows what exactly is going on. The Media reports suggest that the federation has verbally reached an agreement with Queiroz but there is no transparency with regard to the Team. Iran football needs fundamental and structural reforms. BUT ‘the mobile set is off.’ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
