TEHRAN – MP Mostafa Kavakebian has said while there’s no guarantee that Iran’s banking problems would be resolved after joining the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), doing so would put an end to excuses by the other side. “Other countries would not have banking transactions with Iran if [we] do not join this financial action task force,” Kavakebian told the TV’s channel 2, ISNA reported on Sunday. He said the FATF is not related to the nuclear deal and sanctions, adding “not joining the FATF means self-sanctioning.” “With the provisions we have passed in the Majlis, we should not be afraid of joining the FATF at all,” the pro-reform lawmaker stated.
