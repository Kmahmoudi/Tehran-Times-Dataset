TEHRAN- First Vice President Es'haq Jahangiri announced that Iran is expected to maintain a single-digit inflation rate during the upcoming years, IRIB news reported on Saturday. Thanks to the planned programs and application of the policies of "resistance economy"-a set of guidelines promoted by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has called for Iran to make its economy more self-sufficient so that it can resist outside pressure- Iran will continue its path to taming its inflation rate, Jahangiri said. On June 14, 2016, Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Ali Tayyebnia had said that the country planned to reduce the inflation rate to a single digit by the coming two months. The goal was achieved in the last calendar year’s third month of Khordad (ended on June 20, 2016) when the inflation rate hit 9.5 percent.
Curbing inflation was one of the major promises by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during his presidential campaign. Under the previous administration, inflation skyrocketed to cross 44%.  HJ/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
