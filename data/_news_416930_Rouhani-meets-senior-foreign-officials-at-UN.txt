TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani have met a number of foreign leaders in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
 During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Rouhani said Tehran attaches great importance to the European role in protecting the 2015 nuclear deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “The JCPOA bore this message that the complicated international issues can be settled through dialogue and within a win-win framework and any harm to it can bear a dangerous message to the world that problems cannot be solved through diplomacy,” Rouhani noted. He also said that the Trump administration’s behavior towards the JCPOA is “worrisome” for the international community. “The only body that should monitor the JCPOA is the International Atomic Energy Agency which have confirmed for seven times Iran’s compliance to the agreement,” he said. Rouhani told CNN on Monday that exiting the Iran nuclear deal “would carry a high cost for the United States of America, and I do not believe Americans would be willing to pay such a high cost for something that will be useless for them.” Elsewhere, Rouhani said that Iran seeks to expand relations with France in various spheres, adding Iran welcomes French investment.

The agreement went into effect in January 2016.
