TEHRAN – The chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) warned Monday of the trap set by Iran’s enemies for the Iranian youth, calling on them to avoid it.  Speaking at a gathering of sport martyr families, General Hossein Salami said the enemy has devised a scenario to destroy Iran’s glory and big achievements. General Salami said this scenario is being carried out through “evil measures.” According to the IRGC chief, the enemy’s scenario has come out of think tanks in Washington, New York, European capitals and Riyadh.  “The enemy can’t see the brightness of Islamic Iran. They can’t bear to see an Iran overcoming sanctions,” he said, according to Fars News. “The enemies want to move the battle deep into the minds and hearts of our youth.” He added, “A small number of our youth were influenced by the enemy’s insinuations. And we tell this handful of youth ‘know the enemy’ and ‘do not become a political pawn for the enemy against the great country of Iran.’ ‘You should not become foot soldiers for our enemies’ political generals.’ These enemies never want the good for you. We know them. They are evil.” The remarks come after Iran was rocked by a wave of unrest that was markedly waged by teenagers locally known as “Dahe Hashtadi” which refers to the teenagers born in the 2000s.  A senior Iranian security official has said that the United States and Israel are behind the riots that erupted in Iran over the last weeks. Iran’s Deputy Interior Minister for Security and Police Affairs, Majid Mirahmadi, confirmed that the U.S., Israel and their allies are running the riot operations room in the country, Fars News reported.  Mirahmadi averred that in the recent riots, the war room and the leadership of the scene were in the hands of America, the Zionist regime and their allies. “Enemies target the security and stability of the country and make it unsafe. It doesn't matter to them whether this insecurity is for a woman who wears a headscarf or has little adherence to the veil, or a Shiite or a Sunni person,” he said.  He added, “From the enemies' point of view, this insecurity must develop in every neighborhood and point. The most important issue is the psychological warfare the enemies are waging with their own media, considering the huge investments they have made on Persian-speaking satellite media.” The deputy interior minister stated that in the recent riots the enemies in particular carried out the murder-producing project. “The enemies took to the field unprecedentedly with all their energies, openly and covertly; our enemies do not hesitate to announce that they have used all their financial and media capabilities to destabilize Iran,” he said. The security official stated that the rioters created problems for the citizens. “God willing, these rioters will be dealt with decisively. From now on, the detainees at the scene of the riots will not be released until the trial and their trials will be held quickly and very decisive and deterring sentences will be issued against them.” He said, “The elements who undermine security are trying to implement the plans of the enemies of the people, especially America and the Zionist entity [Israel], and they will be dealt with decisively.”    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
