TEHRAN - The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations issued a statement on Wednesday saying that the U.S. and UK are now enjoying a “blood business” in Yemen.
 The United States and Britain are the chief arms suppliers to Saudi Arabia which started a war on Yemen in March 2015. According to the UN, the Saudi-led war on Yemen has created the worst humanitarian disaster in modern history. “U.S. and UK complicity in the creation of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world in Yemen is reprehensible and immeasurable,” the statement reads. Following is full text of the statement posted on IRNA website: Permanent Representatives of U.S. and UK, during the Security Council open briefing on Yemen on 17 April 2018 repeated their derogatory allegations about Iran to cover up their own role in the disastrous situation created in Yemen. Iran categorically rejects those allegations as baseless propaganda. The fact is that the war of aggression of Saudi Arabia in Yemen is the main underlying reason for the escalation of the crisis. It is regrettable that Saudi Arabia and its war mongers supporters, as the main party responsible for such a catastrophic humanitarian situation, are trying to cover up their shameful crimes by introducing false charges against others or trying to spread the crisis beyond Yemen's borders.  U.S. and UK are enjoying a blood business in Yemen now. U.S. is not only supplying bombs to Saudi planes to target civilians but recently has developed its role to formally participating in the planning this inhumane war too. U.S. and UK complicity in the creation of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world in Yemen is reprehensible and immeasurable.
