TEHRAN – If anyone seeks to betray the nuclear deal, they should know that they cannot escape its “grave consequences”, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran warned on Tuesday in an open reference to U.S. President Donald Trump who has repeatedly threatened to destroy the international agreement.  “No one can disappoint this great nation,” Rouhani asserted.  Addressing well-wishers in the city of Tabriz, Rouhani said “the White House dwellers” should know that the great Iranian nation will stand decisively against all Washington’s conspiracies, emphasizing that nothing can prevent Iran from moving forward.
