TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met on Monday with South African President Jacob Zuma in Pretoria.
 Expansion of bilateral political and economic relations and international issues were discussed during the meeting. Also during a meeting with Iranian residents in South Africa on Monday, Zarif said that Iranian people have been able to overcome the sanctions and counter aggressions over the past 40 years. The chief diplomat also said that Iran does not depend on any other country to maintain security and make economic advances. There are many countries that purchase military equipment because “their security does not come from within”, he added.  “We are not like some Persian Gulf littoral states to go to Camp David after seeing the U.S. frowning,” Zarif pointed out. The Iranian foreign minister arrived in Pretoria as the first leg of his tour of Africa on Sunday. Zarif and South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane signed a cooperation document in banking, development and investment, biotechnology, nanotechnology, agriculture, transportation, fisheries, beekeeping and shipping during the 13th meeting of Iran–South Africa Joint Economic Committee. He announced that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani plans to visit South Africa in future months. He left Pretoria for Uganda on Tuesday.
