TEHRAN – The nuclear deal, which Iran and six world powers struck in 2015, can still be saved, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Non-Proliferation and Weapons Control Department Mikhail Ulyanov has said. “I think that time has not yet come for unambiguously pessimistic conclusions. The nuclear deal can still be saved,” Ulyanov said, RIA Novosti reported on Saturday. Ulyanov explained that Moscow proceeds from the fact that at the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2020 Review Conference, which will be held from April 23 to May 4, the supporters of the JCPOA “should raise their voice in support of this deal”.
