TEHRAN -In what has been described as the worst flood situation in over 100 years, at least 324 people have been killed in flooding in the southern Indian state of Kerala. The situation has become extremely grim with death toll mounting since Thursday. Reports in Indian media said governmental and non-governmental rescue teams are battling torrential rains to save people trapped in the floods, with more than 200,000 people already rendered homeless. All the 44 rivers in Kerala are overflowing at present. One of the main tourist attractions in India, Kerala has been battered by record monsoon rainfall this year. The provincial government of Kerala said many of those who died were crushed under debris caused by landslides. With more rains predicted and a red alert in place, government has its task cut out. Kerala’s chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has described it as the worst flooding the state has seen in a century. “We're witnessing something that has never happened before in the history of Kerala,” he told reporters, adding that more than 223,000 people were now living in 1,500 emergency relief camps. India’s home minister Rajnath Singh also termed it the worst floods in Kerala since 1924. In a statement, the ministry said more than 930 people have now died across India since the country's monsoon season began in June.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
