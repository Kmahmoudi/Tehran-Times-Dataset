TEHRAN - Abolfazl Shekarchi, spokesman of the Iranian Armed Forces, has repudiated the allegations leveled by the U.S. and Ukraine against Iran providing weaponry to Russia for use in the Ukraine war as untrue.  Shekarchi said the ruling regime in Ukraine is totally subservient to the Zionists and the Americans, according to Press TV. "These remarks and accusations attributed to Iran by the presidents of the United States and Ukraine are sheer lies and slander," he added. He emphasized that Iran has had military equipment exchanges with Russia which date back to years before the war between Moscow and Kiev, stressing that "Iran is not involved in the war between these two states." The senior commander emphasized that the U.S. provides Ukraine's army with various types of weapons and military equipment, but accuses Iran of involvement in the war. Iran has long denied that it provided Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian responded to Western allegations that Iran provided Russia with drones and missiles for use in the Ukraine war. He said the West’s kerfuffle over the provision of missiles is “entirely wrong” while the issues pertaining to the drones are “right,” according to the Iranian state news agency IRNA. “We provided a limited number of drones to Russia months before [the start] of the Ukraine war. And we agreed with the Ukrainian foreign minister that if you have any evidence of Russia using Iranian drones in Ukraine, give us the evidence,” he added. He said this was agreed upon two weeks ago in a European country and a political and defense delegation from Iran went to that European country for a meeting with Ukrainian officials but the Ukrainian side called off the meeting in the last minute. “The reason for the absence of the Ukrainian side was that the United States and some European countries, especially Germany, asked Ukraine not to participate in this meeting. They said [to the Ukrainian officials] that while we want to impose sanctions against Iran over the provision of drones to Russia, you want to drink coffee with Iranians in a European country!” Amir Abdollahian said. He added, “After that, in the telephone conversation that we had with the foreign minister of Ukraine last week, we agreed that if there is any evidence, they will provide us with it, and if the Ukrainian side sticks to its promise, we will be able to examine this issue in the coming days, and their evidence will be taken into consideration.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
