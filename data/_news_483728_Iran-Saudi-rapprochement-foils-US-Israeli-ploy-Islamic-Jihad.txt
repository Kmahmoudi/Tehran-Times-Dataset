TEHRAN- The reconciliation pact between Iran and Saudi Arabia, according to the representative of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement in Tehran, has dealt a devastating blow to Israel at a time that the regime is mired in its own problems.  The comments were delivered on Saturday by Nasser Abu-Sharif at the University of Tehran, one day after International Quds Day rallies. “The globe is undergoing significant changes that will be beneficial to the movement supporting Palestine. Palestine might gain from the growth of nations like China and Russia,” he said, adding, “Regional events like the Iran-Saudi accord wreaked havoc on the Zionist regime. It is the accord that foiled the Zionist-American scheme which was intended to depict the Islamic Republic as the region’s only enemy.”  Abu-Sharif said the Tehran-Riyadh agreement can have a wide-ranging influence on the region, from Yemen to Palestine. He also mentioned Syria’s return to the Arab fold and the political resolution of the country’s issues as other promising developments. After seven years of estrangement, Iran and Saudi Arabia decided to reestablish diplomatic ties and reopen their embassies on March 10, following five days of intense discussions in China. Following the signing of the agreement, Tehran and Riyadh issued a joint statement emphasizing the need to respect one another’s national sovereignty and refrain from meddling in one another’s internal affairs. They also agreed to put into effect the agreement made in May 1998 to increase cooperation in areas of economy, commerce, investment, technology, science, culture, sports, youth as well as a security cooperation pact inked in April 2001. Additionally, the Islamic Jihad envoy stressed that battling against the occupation regime of Israel is in line with the interests of all Muslim countries. The presence of the vile Zionist regime is destructive to the whole region, he said, adding that the “severe bipolar state” is causing a catastrophe for the Tel Aviv regime.  As a result of the populace’s disagreement over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s so-called initiatives to revamp the judicial system, Israel is currently experiencing one of its worst domestic crises in history. “Iran-Saudi reconciliation favors Palestinian cause” A lecturer at a seminary in Syria has also said improving ties between Islamic nations, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia, is advantageous to the Islamic world in general and Palestine in particular. Speaking with IRNA, Sheikh Samir Obeid asserted that arrogance always tries to promote strife among Muslims and that they have embraced the “divide and rule” approach.  The détente between Iran and Saudi Arabia as two regional heavyweights would not only boost relations between the two nations, but also among all Islamic countries. He emphasized that an unwavering attitude will assist the Resistance Front and serve as the cornerstone for the liberation of Palestine in reference to the resolute posture that will be adopted against Zionism in the next Islamic conference.
