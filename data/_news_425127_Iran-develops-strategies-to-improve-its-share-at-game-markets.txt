TEHRAN – The director of Iran’s National Foundation for Computer Games (NFCG), Hassan Karimi-Qoddusi, has said that his organization has developed three strategies to improve its share in Iranian and global markets for computer games.  He made the remarks during the opening ceremony the 2nd Tehran Game Convention (TGC) at the IRIB International Conference Hall on Thursday. “The first strategy is to reinforce the domestic game industry. Our game industry needs transparent financial and non-financial supports as well as professional training,” he said. The second strategy is to globalize the Iranian game industry, he said, adding that in the meantime, the national identity of the industry should be maintained. “I hope the Iranian game developers make the best use of the meetings held during the two-day event. The most successful developers are those who are in contact with a broad network including domestic and foreign experts where they can share experiences,” he added. Preserving domestic game markets is Iran’s third strategy, Karimi-Qoddusi said.  “We are responsible for preparing a positive atmosphere to help Iranian game developers compete in the world,” he added. Iran intends to collect a 10 percent tax from foreign game developers to help develop the Iranian game projects, he noted. Kate Edwards, the executive director of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) from 2012 to 2017, also delivered a speech at the TGC. Representatives of over 1300 international game developers and distributers attended the two-day event.  The participating companies included Wargaming.net from Cyprus, and HeroCraft and Mail.Ru Group, both from Russia.  Also included were PlayAd Media Group, a pioneer in video advertising across the Nordic region; Inca Games, a producer and publisher of interactive content in Buenos Aires; Gamigo Group, a leading gaming business in Europe and North America; and XENDEX, a pioneer in mobile gaming in Vienna. A number of master classes were also held on the sidelines of the Tehran Game Convention.
