TEHRAN - A professor of political science at Georgetown University says the exit of Britain from the European Union would possibly help resolve differences between Tehran and the EU easily. “Britain’s exit would not much affect Iran’s relations with the EU. However, because Britain has always had a more hardline approach to relations with Iran, its exit might make resolving some EU-Iran disagreement easier,” Shireen Hunter tells the Tehran Times. Following is the text the interview: Q: Would the British exit from the EU affect London’s ties with European countries?  A: It is unlikely that the British withdrawal from the EU would dramatically alter its relation with other European countries. The exception is of course trade where new trade pacts would have to be negotiated. Britain would become closer to the EFTA countries, namely Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Britain’s traditional close political relations with countries such as Holland and Portugal will also survive. However, much depends on how the process of separation unfolds. Ultimately, Iran-EU relations will continue to be determined by factors such as Iran-U.S. relations and Iran’s Middle East policies and the British exit will not change these dynamics. Q: Moreover, will the exit affect the quality of Britain’s ties with Middle East countries? A: The British exit is unlikely to affect significantly its relations with the Middle East especially its traditional allies such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Oman. However, the UK may grow even closer to these countries and it will not be bound by potential EU actions regarding these countries human rights record or arms sales to these states. Britain’s relations with Israel might also grow closer. Q: Will the exit also influence the relations between London and Tehran? Or will the withdrawal benefit Iran? A: Britain’s exit would not much affect Iran’s relations with the EU. However, because Britain has always had a more hardline approach to relations with Iran, its exit might make resolving some EU-Iran disagreement easier. Ultimately, Iran-EU relations will continue to be determined by factors such as Iran-U.S. relations and Iran’s Middle East policies and the British exit will not change these dynamics.
