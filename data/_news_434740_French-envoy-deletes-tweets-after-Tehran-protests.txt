TEHRAN – French Ambassador in Washington Gerard Araud has deleted his controversial tweets about the Iran nuclear deal. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Araud said, “It’s false to say that at the expiration of the JCPOA, Iran will be allowed to enrich uranium,” adding that sanctions could be reimposed. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Sunday that the comments were “a major violation of the object and purpose of the” deal and demanded “immediate clarification by Paris, or we act accordingly.” Iran also summoned the French ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the remarks. So far, France has not provided an explanation about the tweets. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
