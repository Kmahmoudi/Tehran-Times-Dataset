TEHRAN – A former prime minister of Norway told ABC7 on Thursday he was questioned and prevented from leaving Dulles Airport, Virginia, for about an hour, apparently because he had visited Iran in 2014.

 Kjell Magne Bondevik served as prime minister of Norway two separate times, from 1997-2000 and 2001-2005. He flew into Dulles Airport from Europe on Tuesday. He said he was not immediately allowed to leave after customs agents saw in his passport that he had been to Iran. SP/PA
