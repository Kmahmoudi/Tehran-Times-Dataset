Following is an interview with, Tal'at Moslem, an Egyptian strategy expert, on the repercussions of the Israeli attack: Q. What is your opinion on the increasing number of Israeli attacks, both inside and outside of the occupied territories, and in regard to last night's attack on the Syrian base? A. The use of excessive force against Palestinians is (Ariel) Sharon's policy. The Israelis say it was a retaliatory attack in response to Sunday's Hizbollah attack on Israel which left an Israeli soldier dead. They did this in order to pressure Syria into withdrawing support of Hizbollah. Israel invades Palestinian lands with the full support of the United States, having no fear of international bodies and tribunals. Q. Is there a possibility of war, after the air raids against the Syrian base? A. There is no possibility of war, but anti-Zionist clashes will continue, which may lead to a broad-based war. Q. What will be the repercussions of the Israeli air raid against Syria? A. The worst result for the Zionists is the disturbance of regional security and stability. They will also have to deal with rising tensions and retaliatory attacks, plus the official reactions of the Arab League and other countries. This will backfire on the Zionists and the U.S. Meanwhile, in reaction to the Zionist air strike, different countries condemned the attack, while the United States blamed Lebanese Islamist group Hizbollah for provoking Israeli air strikes on a Syrian target in Lebanon. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi meanwhile, in a telephone conversation with his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim bin Jaber ath-Thani on Monday evening, denounced the recent Zionist attacks against Syrian and Lebanese positions. During the telephone call, Kharrazi called for urgent measures to be taken by the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to condemn Israel's provocative acts and provide support for the regional Muslim nations. Also Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara in a telephone conversation with Kharrazi discussed the latest developments in the Middle East. In his contact, the Syrian foreign minister stated that the Israeli regime is deepening the crisis in the Middle East as well as seeking a pretext, therefore the international community should not remain indifferent toward the dangerous moves of this regime. Farouq al-Shara also thanked Islamic states, the Islamic Republic of Iran in particular, for expressing support for Syria. Also, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi condemned Israel air raid on the Syrian radar base. U.S. State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, condemned what it called a "dangerous escalation" in Middle East violence, AFP said. "In the last 48 hours we have seen a dangerous escalation across the withdrawal line that was established by the United Nations," Boucher said, referring to the so-called "blue line" that marks the Lebanese border. "We condemn this escalation in the cycle of violence that was initiated by Hizbollah in a clear provocation designed to escalate an already tense situation," Boucher told reporters. "We call upon all sides to exercise maximum restraint," he said, adding the Secretary of State Colin Powell had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon before the air strikes and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres afterward. Asked whether Washington was condemning both the initial attack by Hizbollah on Saturday that killed an Israeli soldier and Israel's retaliatory response on the Syrian position that killed at least two troops, Boucher became evasive. He answered "yes" when asked if the United States condemned the Hizbollah attack but when asked whether Washington condemned the Israeli response, he replied that the United States condemned "the cycle of violence." "We're condemning the overall violence that is occurring," Boucher said. "What we saw was an unprovoked attack (by Hizbollah), a clear provocation that was designed to set off a cycle of violence and we think that's where the burden rests," he said. A senior State Department official later ruled out any harsh words or condemnation for Israel in its attack. Meanwhile European nations, including France and Germany, have expressed deep concern over the attack and the chance that it could lead to a serious deterioration. As Boucher was speaking, violence erupted anew in Israel and the Palestinian territories when Israeli tanks pounded Palestinian security positions in the northern Gaza Strip, injuring three people. The tank blasts came in swift retaliation for a mortar attack on an Israeli town nearby. Persian Gulf Arab states condemned Israel's air strike against a Syrian radar station in Lebanon, with regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia calling the attack a "despicable act". The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency late on Monday that the attack showed Israel had adopted the language of war and destruction. "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia strongly condemns this despicable act which conveys a blatant challenge to international law," the statement said. Kuwait and Oman condemned the Israeli strike as "blatant aggression" against Lebanon and Syria and called for international pressure on the Jewish state to stop attacks. Syria urged Arabs to stop all contact with Israel in response to the Israeli air strike. Vice President Zuheir Masharqa said Arabs should "work sincerely to confront the dangers posed by Israel and its racial and expansionist policies". "Kuwait urges the international community, especially Middle East peace sponsors the United States and Russia, to intervene to end the escalating Israeli attacks which could undermine the situation in the region," a Foreign Ministry official said in a statement carried by the official KUNA news agency. Oman warned that "any new Israeli military adventure would complicate efforts to put peacemaking back on track". Egypt, Yemen and Qatar, which currently heads the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the world's largest Muslim body, had earlier condemned the raid. Iran, Qatar, Jordan and the Palestinian authority condemned the attack on Monday. Also Russia, France, China and Germany voiced concern over the issue.

This will backfire on the Zionists and the U.S. Meanwhile, in reaction to the Zionist air strike, different countries condemned the attack, while the United States blamed Lebanese Islamist group Hizbollah for provoking Israeli air strikes on a Syrian target in Lebanon. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi meanwhile, in a telephone conversation with his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim bin Jaber ath-Thani on Monday evening, denounced the recent Zionist attacks against Syrian and Lebanese positions. During the telephone call, Kharrazi called for urgent measures to be taken by the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to condemn Israel's provocative acts and provide support for the regional Muslim nations. Also Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara in a telephone conversation with Kharrazi discussed the latest developments in the Middle East. In his contact, the Syrian foreign minister stated that the Israeli regime is deepening the crisis in the Middle East as well as seeking a pretext, therefore the international community should not remain indifferent toward the dangerous moves of this regime. Farouq al-Shara also thanked Islamic states, the Islamic Republic of Iran in particular, for expressing support for Syria. Also, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi condemned Israel air raid on the Syrian radar base. U.S. State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, condemned what it called a "dangerous escalation" in Middle East violence, AFP said. "In the last 48 hours we have seen a dangerous escalation across the withdrawal line that was established by the United Nations," Boucher said, referring to the so-called "blue line" that marks the Lebanese border. "We condemn this escalation in the cycle of violence that was initiated by Hizbollah in a clear provocation designed to escalate an already tense situation," Boucher told reporters. "We call upon all sides to exercise maximum restraint," he said, adding the Secretary of State Colin Powell had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon before the air strikes and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres afterward. Asked whether Washington was condemning both the initial attack by Hizbollah on Saturday that killed an Israeli soldier and Israel's retaliatory response on the Syrian position that killed at least two troops, Boucher became evasive. He answered "yes" when asked if the United States condemned the Hizbollah attack but when asked whether Washington condemned the Israeli response, he replied that the United States condemned "the cycle of violence." "We're condemning the overall violence that is occurring," Boucher said. "What we saw was an unprovoked attack (by Hizbollah), a clear provocation that was designed to set off a cycle of violence and we think that's where the burden rests," he said. A senior State Department official later ruled out any harsh words or condemnation for Israel in its attack. Meanwhile European nations, including France and Germany, have expressed deep concern over the attack and the chance that it could lead to a serious deterioration. As Boucher was speaking, violence erupted anew in Israel and the Palestinian territories when Israeli tanks pounded Palestinian security positions in the northern Gaza Strip, injuring three people. The tank blasts came in swift retaliation for a mortar attack on an Israeli town nearby. Persian Gulf Arab states condemned Israel's air strike against a Syrian radar station in Lebanon, with regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia calling the attack a "despicable act". The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency late on Monday that the attack showed Israel had adopted the language of war and destruction. "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia strongly condemns this despicable act which conveys a blatant challenge to international law," the statement said. Kuwait and Oman condemned the Israeli strike as "blatant aggression" against Lebanon and Syria and called for international pressure on the Jewish state to stop attacks. Syria urged Arabs to stop all contact with Israel in response to the Israeli air strike. Vice President Zuheir Masharqa said Arabs should "work sincerely to confront the dangers posed by Israel and its racial and expansionist policies". "Kuwait urges the international community, especially Middle East peace sponsors the United States and Russia, to intervene to end the escalating Israeli attacks which could undermine the situation in the region," a Foreign Ministry official said in a statement carried by the official KUNA news agency. Oman warned that "any new Israeli military adventure would complicate efforts to put peacemaking back on track". Egypt, Yemen and Qatar, which currently heads the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the world's largest Muslim body, had earlier condemned the raid. Iran, Qatar, Jordan and the Palestinian authority condemned the attack on Monday. Also Russia, France, China and Germany voiced concern over the issue.

As Boucher was speaking, violence erupted anew in Israel and the Palestinian territories when Israeli tanks pounded Palestinian security positions in the northern Gaza Strip, injuring three people. The tank blasts came in swift retaliation for a mortar attack on an Israeli town nearby. Persian Gulf Arab states condemned Israel's air strike against a Syrian radar station in Lebanon, with regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia calling the attack a "despicable act". The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency late on Monday that the attack showed Israel had adopted the language of war and destruction. "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia strongly condemns this despicable act which conveys a blatant challenge to international law," the statement said. Kuwait and Oman condemned the Israeli strike as "blatant aggression" against Lebanon and Syria and called for international pressure on the Jewish state to stop attacks. Syria urged Arabs to stop all contact with Israel in response to the Israeli air strike. Vice President Zuheir Masharqa said Arabs should "work sincerely to confront the dangers posed by Israel and its racial and expansionist policies". "Kuwait urges the international community, especially Middle East peace sponsors the United States and Russia, to intervene to end the escalating Israeli attacks which could undermine the situation in the region," a Foreign Ministry official said in a statement carried by the official KUNA news agency. Oman warned that "any new Israeli military adventure would complicate efforts to put peacemaking back on track". Egypt, Yemen and Qatar, which currently heads the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the world's largest Muslim body, had earlier condemned the raid. Iran, Qatar, Jordan and the Palestinian authority condemned the attack on Monday. Also Russia, France, China and Germany voiced concern over the issue.
                  "We condemn this escalation in the cycle of violence that was initiated by Hizbollah in a clear provocation designed to escalate an already tense situation," Boucher told reporters. "We call upon all sides to exercise maximum restraint," he said, adding the Secretary of State Colin Powell had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon before the air strikes and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres afterward. Asked whether Washington was condemning both the initial attack by Hizbollah on Saturday that killed an Israeli soldier and Israel's retaliatory response on the Syrian position that killed at least two troops, Boucher became evasive. He answered "yes" when asked if the United States condemned the Hizbollah attack but when asked whether Washington condemned the Israeli response, he replied that the United States condemned "the cycle of violence." "We're condemning the overall violence that is occurring," Boucher said. "What we saw was an unprovoked attack (by Hizbollah), a clear provocation that was designed to set off a cycle of violence and we think that's where the burden rests," he said.
