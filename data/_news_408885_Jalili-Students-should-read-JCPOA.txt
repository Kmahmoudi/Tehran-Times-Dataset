TEHRAN – Former chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said on Tuesday that students should read the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), official name of the Iran nuclear deal.

 Speaking at Sharif University of Technology on the occasion of Student Day, Jalili said, “The system’s aim of accepting the JCPOA was for people to gain experience,” Rajanews reported. “Today, when… all testify to the enmity of America with the Iranian nation, it is the best time to assess the kind of relations with America,” Jalili stated.
