TEHRAN - Insecurity is a major electoral issue for President Muhammadu Buhari as he seeks re-election in 2019 polls. When Buhari won the presidential election in 2015 among the promises made was to restore the country back to peace and to ensure total security in the state, creation of job opportunities, better and easy life for the masses.  Ironically,  the opposite was the case,  life became more callous for the ordinary people, insecurities have always been the norms of the day which if it is critically view is nothing other than a political agenda. At the early hour of Buhari's reign a group of terrorist emerged known as herdsmen with their cattles entering villages destroying farm lands and slaughtering people, herdsmen are known to be carrying sticks with their cattle moving from place to place "nomadic farming". During the terrorized period of the herdsmen Buhari did not take any measures to stop the inhuman perpetrating by the herdsmen which was originated from his own state rather he was given condolences to the victims Govnor Peter Ayo Fayose , once describe president Buhari as a "captured president " wondered why a retired Army general and one time military head of state, contested and own the election in a democratic era on the ground to provide security to the citizens have suddenly became lame duck,  "This is a killer government". The frequency Boko Haram attacks on Nigerian soldiers have threatened Buhari's re-election, As Nigeria prepares for general elections in February, a series of attacks by Boko Haram has focused attention on the security situation in the country. The armed group appears to have regained ground in the country's northeast in 2018, pushing into towns and villages it had previously lost to the Nigerian military. With an escalation of attacks in recent months, the Nigerian government's claims of victory against Boko Haram appear premature. The nine-year conflict with Boko Haram, that has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced two million others from their homes in Nigeria, has also spread to neighboring Chad, Niger, and Cameroon.
