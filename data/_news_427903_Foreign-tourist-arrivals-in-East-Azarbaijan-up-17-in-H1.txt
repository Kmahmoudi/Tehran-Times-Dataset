TEHRAN - The number of international tourists visiting Iran’s northwestern East Azarbaijan province surged 17 percent in the first six months of the current Iranian calendar year (started on March 21) from a year earlier, provincial tourism chief said on Tuesday. Morteza Abdar didn’t mention the number of arrivals in the 6-month period, CHTN reported. “A total of 16,526,534 foreign travelers arrived in the province during the first five months, which shows 14 percent year-on-year growth,” the official said. Tabriz, the capital of East Azarbaijan, is currently holding the title of 2018 Islamic Tourism Capital. It used to be a world craft city for carpet weaving in 2016. Jameh Mosque of Tabriz, Arg of Tabriz, and UNESCO-registered Tabriz Historic Bazaar Complex are amongst top destination for travelers to the city.
