TEHRAN – Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Larijani stressed on Monday that the U.S.-backed ceasefire in Syria has proven to be an “American ruse” as it benefits terrorist groups in the country.  “Bombing the Syrian army position, the Americans showed that they are siding with the terrorist current and their counterterrorism motto is a sheer lie,” Larijani said in a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart Hadieh Khalaf Abbas.  On September 9, Washington and Moscow announced a plan to bring about a ceasefire in Syria which took force three days later.  However, the truce was practically dead as Damascus refused to extend the deal due to an airstrike by the U.S. air force on September 17 which left more than 80 Syrian soldiers dead and more dozens injured.  The Russian army said in a statement that two F-16 and two A-10 jets had entered the Syrian airspace from Iraq to carry out the attacks, according to Press TV.     The Iranian parliament speaker rejected remarks made by some regional countries that they are seeking a more democratic Syria through stirring tension in the country, saying, “It is impossible to deepen democracy in a country through creating tension.”  “The remarks are made by countries which have not held even one single election in their countries,” he further said. On uprooting terrorism, Larijani called for a more concerted effort by the global community, rapping the West’s double standards on the issue of terrorism.  “The roots of terrorism must be withered. The West cannot act on the basis of double standards, countering terrorism in their home countries on the one hand, and fueling terrorism in Syria on the other hand.”  Hadiya Khalaf Abbas: Not for Iran’s backing, Syria and Iraq would have fallen  Hadiya Khalaf Abbas, for her part, hailed the Iranian people and officials for fully backing Syria, noting that Damascus could not have been able to resist pressure from foreign-backed terrorists without Tehran’s backing.  According to Hadiya Khalaf Abbas, Syria is going through a militancy sponsored by more than 80 countries. She said the conflict has devastated historic monuments and inflicted heavy losses on her country. The top Syrian parliamentarian also dismissed U.S. allegations that the aerial attack on Dayr al-Zawr had been a mistake, underscoring that American military aircraft had been flying over the area for about 45 minutes. Hadiya Khalaf Abbas said the Syrian government is in possession of documents that prove Americans launched the airstrikes to assist Daesh terrorists, noting that Washington has acted against Syria any time government forces have made gains against the Takfiri militants. Syria has been gripped by a bloody foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Over the past few months, the Takfiri militants have suffered major setbacks as the army has liberated several areas.
