TEHRAN - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its latest World Economic Outlook titled “Seeking Sustainable Growth: Short-Term Recovery, Long-Term Challenges” predicted a 3.8 percent real GDP growth for Iran in 2018, rising from 3.5 percent in 2017.
 “In 2018, growth is expected to increase to 3.8 percent, mostly reflecting stronger domestic demand in oil importers and a rebound of oil production in oil exporters,” the report said. The data presented indicates that Iran’s GDP growth will outpace that of Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan which is going to be 3.5 percent in 2018 and 3.8 percent by 2022. Iran’s GDP will increase to 4.1 by 2022, while the country’s consumer price inflation which stands at 10.5 percent in the current year will fall to 10.1 percent in 2018 and to 8.7 percent by 2022.
