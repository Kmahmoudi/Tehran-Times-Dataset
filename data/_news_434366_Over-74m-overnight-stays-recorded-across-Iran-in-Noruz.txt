TEHRAN – Iranians made over 74 million overnight stays during the two-week New Year (Noruz) holidays, starting March 21, CHTN reported. Some 74 million and 300 overnight stays have been recorded based on data compiled by the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, CHHTO deputy for tourism Vali Teymouri announced on Friday. On average, 18 million people have traveled throughout Noruz, which shows a six percent year-on-year increase, he said. Iranians make hundreds of thousands of domestic trips during the New Year holidays, when most businesses and workplaces are closed, as are schools. Earlier in March, CHHTO Director Ali-Asghar Mounesan estimated that domestic trips would grow by 20 percent over the New Year holidays.

Ancient bazaars, museums, mosques, monuments, gardens, historical sites, rich natural and rural landscapes are amongst its most popular destinations.
