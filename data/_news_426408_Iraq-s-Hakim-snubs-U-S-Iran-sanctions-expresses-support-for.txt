TEHRAN - Ammar al-Hakim, leader of the Iraqi National Wisdom Movement, has announced support for Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions.
 Hakim said the policy of threatening and putting the countries under economic siege is “wrong” and “unfair”, ISNA reported on Saturday. Expressing Iraq’s solidarity with Iran, he said, “Today, we express our opposition against such actions which are being taken against the brotherly nation of Iran and other free nations in the world.” He added unilateral actions which run contrary to the UN regulations are condemnable. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s unilateral exit from the multilateral nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran.  The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on Monday, August 6.  The second batch will be restored on November 4. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in May that the U.S. will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic. On July 16, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran had filed a complaint at the International Court of Justice against the U.S. for reintroducing sanctions. The first hearing session in the case will be held on August 27. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
