TEHRAN – Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani has predicted that the Palestinian youths will shatter all of the “illusions” of the United States and Saudi Arabia. Addressing an open session of the parliament on Sunday, Larijani said the U.S. and some Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, are secretly attempting to undermine security in the region in order to limit the Palestinians to the Gaza Strip and a “corner” of the West Bank, IRNA reported. Pointing to Riyadh’s tacit recognition of the Zionist regime, the parliament speaker said the Saudis are interested in bestowing their country’s national wealth to the Americans in order to buy Washington’s support. “The fact that the Saudis have announced that their actions in organizing Takfiri terrorists groups and killing thousands of people have been guided by America is an alarm for the world and the region; they have done evil deeds in the name of religion and philanthropy,” he stated. Larijani also called on Islamic countries and parliaments to support the Palestinian people in the face of a new wave of Israeli violence. In two consecutive Fridays, March 30 and April 30, Israeli forces killed 30 Palestinians in Gaza for holding rallies near the Israeli fence. Larijani said the responsibility to support Palestine and prevent a shame in the Arab world falls upon the thinkers and parliaments of Islamic and Arab states. He further said Iran’s parliament would ask the Islamic Inter-Parliamentary Union (IIPU) and the Asian Parliamentary Assembly (APA) to support the oppressed Palestinian nation against the Israeli brutality.
