 In his visit Rouhani also plans to hold talks with Kazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Rouhani’s most important program in the two-day visit is to participate in the Caspian Sea summit in which a number of important and strategic documents for cooperation will be signed by the five countries bordering the sea. The president will also hold bilateral meetings with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and a number of other heads of state to discuss relations, presidential office media department chief Parviz Esmaeili said.  President will be accompanied by a number of cabinet members. Rouhani will return to Tehran on Sunday evening. The summit will be attended by presidents of the five Caspian Sea littoral states - Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan. The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed water body on earth by area, variously classed as the world’s largest lake or a full-fledged sea.  The Caspian Sea Convention determines the territorial rights of littoral states as well as other matters related to the sea.
