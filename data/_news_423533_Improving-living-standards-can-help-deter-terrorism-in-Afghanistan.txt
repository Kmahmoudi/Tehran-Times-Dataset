TEHRAN – Iran’s Secretary of Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani told Afghan Defense Minister Tariq Shah Bahrami on Sunday that economic development and improving people’s living standards can help deter terrorist acts in Afghanistan. 
 Shamkhani also said boosting the capability of the Afghan security forces will help create peace and security in the country. Afghanistan has been the scene of repeated deadly terror attacks in recent weeks. The emergence of Daesh in the central Asian country has caused shockwaves across the countries in the region. Shamkhani also told the visiting Afghan defense chief that the United States is the main root of terrorism in the region. “Iraq and Syria’s experiences show that the U.S. is the main root of organizing terrorists and causing instability and insecurity in these countries, and certain reactionary Arab countries have supported this procedure financially,” Iran’s top security official stated.  Shamkhani added, “Unfortunately, certain regional countries provide Takfiri terrorism with financial and intelligence supports which is a deep threat against the Islamic countries and nations.” He said, “This can only be countered through cooperation and adoption of joint approaches.”  Shamkhani went on to say that Islamic countries have the responsibility to fight ideological roots of terrorism. Afghanistan has been in war since the Soviets invaded the country in 1979. After the Soviet Army left the country in 1989, the country was caught in a civil conflict which persists until today.    Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been the main inciters of sectarianism in Afghanistan. These two countries, which are considered the main allies of the United States in the region, recognized Taliban which ruled Afghanistan until September 11 attacks in 2001.  ‘Iran has been on Afghan side in difficult times’ Defense Minister Bahrami, for his part, praised Iran’s support for Afghanistan in most difficult times. Iran has been hosting millions of Afghans since 1979. Bahrami also said Afghanistan will not let foreigners pose threats against Iran from Afghan soil. During a separate meeting with the Afghan defense minister, General Mohammad Hossein Baqeri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, said Iran has always supported the Afghan people. The officials also discussed expansion of cooperation. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
