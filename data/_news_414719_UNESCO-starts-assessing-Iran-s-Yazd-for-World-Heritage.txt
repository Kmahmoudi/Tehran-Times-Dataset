TEHRAN - The UNESCO World Heritage Committee on Sunday commenced assessing 35 nominees, including Iranâ€™s historical city of Yazd, for possible inscription on the World Heritage list. The committee will also review the conservation status of 99 World Heritage sites and of 55 others inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger during its 41st session, which runs through 12 July in Krakow, Poland. Historical Centre of Mbanza Kongo in Angola, Valongo Wharf Archaeological Site in Brazil, Caves with the oldest Ice Age art in Germany, Historic City of Ahmadabad in India are amongst the nominees for inclusion in the prestigious list. The oasis city of Yazd is wedged between the northern Dasht-e Kavir and southern Dasht-e Lut on a flat plain ringed by mountains. Its historical structure enjoys a very harmonious public-religious architecture that dates from different eras. In August 2016, Mariana Correia at the head of a UNESCO technical evaluation mission paid a visit to Yazd as part of the decision-making process for inscribing the ancient city.
