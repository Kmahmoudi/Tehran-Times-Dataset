TEHRAN – Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the aerospace unit of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, has said Iran has managed to take control of several U.S. drones.

 As proof of Tehran’s claim, it has released some footage, apparently taken from the drones’ cameras. “Seven to eight drones that had constant flights over Syria and Iraq were brought under our control and their intel was monitored by us and we could gain their first-hand intel,” RT reported, citing Fars which quoted Hajizadeh. Fars released a video, which it called “one of the many proofs in support of General Hajizadeh’s remarks.” SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
