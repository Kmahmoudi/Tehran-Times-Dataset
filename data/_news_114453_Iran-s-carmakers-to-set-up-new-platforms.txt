"In the past we were producing vehicles on Paykan platforms and now we are doing it on Peugeot 405 and 206 platforms; in the near future Paykan's platform will be replaced with X90 and PF2 (307 platform) will replace 405 platform," said the companyâ€™s managing director Manteqi. "In our Samand project we had no experience on price control, but we reached the knowledge to reach target price in the Peugeot 206 SD project. Therefore we have started the X11 project from the beginning with a target price that we will surely reach," he added. "Regarding the X11 platform I must say that utility period for this project is 24 months, which 4 of have past. This vehicle is to be offered at a price around $7.5 to $8.5 thousand," explained Manteqi.
