TEHRAN – A senior Russian official says Iran’s ballistic missile tests do not violate United Nations Security Council resolutions or international agreements, contrary to the West’s media hype about the Islamic Republic’s missile program.

 “There is no ban that might prevent Iran from testing missiles,” Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Non-Proliferation and Weapons Control Department, said on Tuesday, Press TV reported. He added that a “compromise” was made over Iran’s missile activities under the JCPOA in 2015. SP/PA
