TEHRAN – “Partial progress” has been made in the recent round of hajj negotiations with the Saudi side, the temporary head of the Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization of Iran said on Thursday. “There has been partial progress in negotiations with the Saudi side on dispatching pilgrims to Hajj this year,” Hamid Mohammadi was quoted as saying. Since a 2015 Hajj crush in Mina, Mecca, which resulted in the death of 464 Iranian nationals, Iran has stopped dispatching pilgrims to Saudi Arabia over security concerns.
