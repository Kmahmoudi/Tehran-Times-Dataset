BEIRUT - This week, particularly on the 15th of Rajab, marks the martyrdom anniversary of the Sayedah Zainab (PBUH), the noble granddaughter of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the daughter of the Fourth Caliphate Imam Ali (PBUH). A model of patience, endurance, injustice and defiance against oppression, who was born on the 5th of Jamadi-ul-Awwal in 6 A.H in Madina. Prophet Muhammad was very rejoiced on the birthday of His first beloved granddaughter, embraced her and also cried while carrying her in His arms, telling his daughter Sayedah Fatimah A-Zahraa(PBUH), “My dear, this baby girl will be put to innumerable calamities and suffer great hardships.” It is narrated that God Almighty, through Jibraeel Angel, Sayedah Zainab. Her name ‘Zainab’ is made up of the two words Zain (ornament) and Ab (father), which means the Ornament of her father. Sayedah Zainab was married to her cousin, Abdullah Ibn Jafar-e-Tayyar and was granted with four sons; Aoun and Mohammad were offered as her sacrifices for rescuing Islam in Karbala. After the tragic events and the sacrifices for by Imam Husain A.S. in Karbala, Sayedah Zainab patiently endured various sorts of calamities, tortures and hardships and never showed vulnerability to the tormentors of her time. Indeed, Sayedah Zainab (PBUH) has safeguarded the religion of Islam. Her life, her versatile, innumerable virtues, sublime personality, modesty, chastity and knowledge are the best example for every Muslim woman. Her utter patience, her daring performance her magnanimous behaviour, her eloquent sermons in Kufa and in the court of Yazid in Shaam forwarded the reform project of her brother Imam Hussein (PBUH) and revealed the brutal acts of the Umayyad regime. After she was captured with her kins as captatives, to Shaam, she returned to Madina and continued to unveil Yazid's corruption. Then she was banished to Egypt, as her speeches became a threat to the ruler of Madina. Later, she went to Shaam again where she passed away on the15th of Rajab in 62 A.H. Sayedah Zainab (PBUH)’s sobriety and severity come from her grandmother Sayedah Khadija (PBUH). Her chastity and modesty come from her mother Sayedah Fatimah A-Zahraa (PBUH). Her eloquence comes from her father Imam Ali (PBUH). Her forbearance and patience come from her brother Imam Hassan (PBUH) and her bravery and tranquillity come from her brother Imam Hussein (PBUH). Her eloquent speeches in face of the arrogant corrupted tyrant rulers still echo until today. She addressed the people of Kufah saying, “Woe be upon you! Do you know which part of the Messenger of Allah you have cut? And which vow you have broken? And whose blood you have shed? And which respected family you have brought to the public (as captives)? And whose sanctity you have violated? You have done that, which could tear down the skies, open the earth, and make the mountains vanish. As far as the earth goes and as deep as the skies go, your obvious deed has no like, no similarity and no decency. Indeed you have done the ugliest, the most grievous and gruesome deed.” By the very beginning of the Takfiri aggressive attack on Syria, many brave heroes showed their readiness to guard Sayedah Zainab’s Holy Shrine, under the slogan ‘Labbyki Ya Zainab.’ As far as Shiite Muslims are concerned, this rhetorical expression means that they are ready to sacrifice anything to guard her shrine and methodology of resistance and courage, facing the enemy and any kind of injustice from tyrants. Sayedah Zainab (PBUH)’s philosophy of freedom, steadfastness, justice and combating despotism is unequivocally reveal her outstanding character. She did not collapse, despite all the pain and challenges but rather she emerged as the most courageous female politician with her decisive heroic stances. Her extraordinary patience and faithfulness are embodied in her prayer, amid all the very inhumane and drastic tragedies at Karbala, she said, “O my Lord! Accept our humble sacrifice to You.” Sayedah Zainab (PBUH)’s starring role was exemplary and her speech to Yazid echoes through time and space. She addressed him, “By God, you would not remove our teachings from the minds of our followers, and you would not fade our message. You would not attain our glory and can never wash the stain of this crime from your hands. Your decisions would not be stable, your ruling period would be short, and your population would scatter. In that day, a voice will shout, ‘Indeed may the curse of God be upon the oppressors...’”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
