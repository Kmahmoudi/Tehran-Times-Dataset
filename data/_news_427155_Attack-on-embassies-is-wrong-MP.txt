TEHRAN - Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an Iranian lawmaker, has said that attack on foreign embassies is wrong.
 “Security forces should provide embassies with security,” Alaeddin Boroujerdi, who sits on the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, told ISNA in an interview published on Tuesday. He called attacks on embassies of the UK and Saudi Arabia in Tehran “wrong” and “unusual”. In protest over sanctions during the Ahmadinejad Administration, a number of protesters attacked British embassy in 2011. In 2015, weeks after Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany clinched a nuclear deal, the British embassy in Iran was reopened. Also, in January 2016, a group of protesters stormed the Saudi diplomatic missions in Tehran and Mashhad in protest to the execution of the pro-democracy cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran after the incident despite the condemnation of the move by top Iranian leadership.
