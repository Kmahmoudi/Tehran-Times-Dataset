TEHRAN – Iraqi President Fuad Masum has said that his country will not accompany the U.S. in sanctions against Iran.
 Situation in Iraq and the nature of its ties with Iran make it difficult for Baghdad to be committed to the U.S. sanctions against Iran, he said in an interview with Alhurra TV channel aired on Monday. Pressure on neighboring Iran could make Tehran to respond which influence Iraq as well, the Iraqi president remarked. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran. The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on Monday, August 6.  The second batch will be restored on November 4. On July 16, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran had filed a complaint at the International Court of Justice against the U.S. for reintroducing sanctions. The first hearing session in the case will be held on August 27. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
