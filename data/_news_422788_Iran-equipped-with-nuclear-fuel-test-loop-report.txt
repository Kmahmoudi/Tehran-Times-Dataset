TEHRAN – Iran has mastered nuclear fuel test loop in the Tehran research reactor, marking one of the most important projects that Iranian scientists completed in the field of nuclear fuel industry, ISNA reported. The project on nuclear fuel test loop began in the Persian year 1395 (2016-2017) and was completed by the end of the year 1396 (March 20). Following President Rouhani’s order more than a week ago, the technology was employed in the Tehran research reactor more than a week ago. In addition to its usage in the test of nuclear fuel, the system can also be used in medicine, especially in radiopharmaceuticals. Earlier this month, Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said that Iranian experts have succeeded to reconstruct the Tehran research reactor. “The Tehran reactor is 40 years old and it has been for over a year and a half that we are renewing its various parts,” Salehi, a nuclear physicist, explained. He further said that for the first time a new nuclear fuel test loop has been built in the research reactor to test the resilience of the nuclear fuels used in power plants. In recent years, Iran has made great progress in building equipment in nuclear technology.
