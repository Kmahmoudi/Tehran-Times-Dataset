TEHRAN – The Carpet Museum of Iran has scheduled a gathering on May 16 during which a rare rug depicting portray of Mirza Kuchak Khan will go on display. Several scholars will give speeches on the rug that bears arrays of Persian calligraphy in praise of the 20th century revolutionary figure and is estimated to date from some 110 years ago, ISNA reported on Monday. Currently, the exquisite rug belongs to an Australia-based Iranian who is about to sell it to a private collector, the report said, adding the rug is hoped to find its way home to a museum in Gilan where Kuchak Khan was born. Kuchak Khan is considered a national hero in modern Iranian history. He was the founder of a revolutionary movement based in the forests of Gilan in northern Iran that became known as the Nehzat-e Jangal which is literary translated into “The Jungle Movement”. The Carpet Museum of Iran can be found at the northwest of Laleh Park in the heart of Tehran.
