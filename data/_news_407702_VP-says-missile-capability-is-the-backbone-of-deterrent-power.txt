TEHRAN – Iran’s Vice President Is’haq Jahangiri said in comments on Tuesday the country’s missile capability is the key component of its deterrent power. “Iran’s missile capability is the main index of deterrence that should be reinforced and preserved to get out of the enemies’ mind the idea of any offensive against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he told a gathering of senior officials with the Defense Ministry in Tehran.  From a sheer importer of rockets and short-range missiles, Iran has grown into a missile power through its homegrown technology over the past years.  While regional countries have grown hostile to the country’s missile achievements, Iran says its military capability contributes to a more stable, secure region.  “We can play a stabilizing role in the region only if we are enough powerful and nobody dares to invade the territory,” Jahangiri noted.  The Middle East has been boiling now for nearly 15 years, beginning with the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.  Ever since the regional situation has deteriorated with Saudi Arabia’s invasion of Yemen and a war against ISIS terrorists and rebels in Iraq and Syria.  Also, over the period terrorist explosions have went off in other regional countries such as Turkey and European ones such as France.  This is while all terrorist attempts have been aborted in Iran due to its tight security measures, a point the vice president underscored in his remarks.
