TEHRAN - President Ebrahim Raisi on Tuesday strongly warned Israel against any military action against Iran, saying in that case Haifa and Tel Aviv will be destroyed. “The enemies, especially the Zionist regime, have received this message that the slightest move against the country will evoke a severe response from the armed forces and will be accompanied by the destruction of Haifa and Tel Aviv,” Raisi said while addressing a parade to mark National Army Day in Tehran.
