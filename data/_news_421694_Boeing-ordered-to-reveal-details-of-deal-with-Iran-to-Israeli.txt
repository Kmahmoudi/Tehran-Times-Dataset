TEHRAN – A federal judge has ordered the Boeing corporation to turn over details of a $16 billion contract with Iran Air to the family of an Israeli terror victim who are seeking to collect on a longstanding, $67-million civil judgment against Iran. Chief U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo in Chicago also said that the Trump administration has notified the court that it is complying with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Castillo’s ruling rejects Boeing’s contention that providing the contract details to the victims would not only undermine the mega-contract with Iran Air — but could jeopardize the nuclear deal itself.
