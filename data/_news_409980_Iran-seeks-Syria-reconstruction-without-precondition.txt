TEHRAN – Iran’s deputy foreign minister for African and Arab affairs on Wednesday told EU’s deputy foreign policy chief that the Islamic Republic urges reconstruction of Syria without preconditions.

 During a meeting in Brussels, Hossein Jaberi Ansari told Helga Schmid that the reconstruction process should go on alongside the anti-terrorism campaign. He also urged Syrian-Syrian talks to find a political solution to the country’s ongoing crisis. A nationwide truce took effect in Syria early this year under an agreement drafted by Iran, Russia and Turkey. The warring sides are expected to start talks in Kazakhstan later this month.
