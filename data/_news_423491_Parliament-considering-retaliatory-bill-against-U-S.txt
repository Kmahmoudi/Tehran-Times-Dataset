TEHRAN – Iranian parliamentarians have submitted a double-urgency bill to the Majlis presiding board to retaliate against the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, also called the JCPOA, a top lawmaker said on Saturday. Under the bill, the government will be tasked with adopting reciprocal measures to address Washington’s anti-Iran actions, Mojtaba Zonnouri, chairman of the Majlis Nuclear Committee, told IRNA. The bill also requires the government to get reliable guarantees about the benefits of the nuclear deal from the Europeans and other members of the multilateral agreement, Zonnouri stated.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
