Addressing a group of scholars and scientists, the Supreme Leader stressed that attempts by enemies to humiliate and weaken the Iranian nation have been foiled through great and honorable efforts of Iranian scholars, IRNA reported. The feeling of incapability should be uprooted from the Iranian society since the Iranian people have repeatedly, throughout the history, proved that they are a capable and talented nation, the Supreme Leader pointed out. Referring to each scientific scholar as a divine gift, Ayatollah Khamenei said that a lot of great achievements have been made in the country following the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. The main reason for the hostility of the enemies toward the Iranian nation is that they know the Iranians encourage other nations to believe in their talent and potentials and this would help the World of Islam be free from domination of the big powers, the Supreme Leader stressed.
