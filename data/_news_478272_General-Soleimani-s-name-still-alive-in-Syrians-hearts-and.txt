TEHRAN- Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian met on Tuesday evening with Haifa Jumaa, the Syrian deputy head of the Iran-Syria parliamentary friendship group. Iran's foreign minister lauded the valor of the heroes of the resistance front, notably Martyr General Soleimani, who committed their life to the fight against Daesh terrorists. Amir Abdollahian also mentioned the elevated stature of the two nations' parliaments and their role in expanding bilateral collaboration, particularly in the economic area, noting that there are significant untapped potentials for the purpose. In the meeting, the Syrian deputy head of the parliamentary friendship group also pointed to the two countries' strategic connections and praised Iran's support for the Syrian country in its fight against terrorism and extremism. Haifa Jumaa, who led a parliamentary delegation to Iran, stated that Martyr General Soleimani's name and remembrance are still alive in the Syrian people's hearts and minds. General Soleimani led the resistance against terrorist groups, including Daesh, in Syria and Iraq. Envious of his legendary commandership, the U.S. assassinated him near Baghdadâ€™s international airport in January 2020.
