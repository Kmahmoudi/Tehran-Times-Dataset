TEHRAN – While the Astana and Geneva talks each contributes differently to the Syrian crisis, the two are “mutually supportive”, the Chinese special Syrian envoy said on Saturday. “I think the two platforms, each having its own special role to play, but can also be mutually supportive,” Xie Xiaoyan said in a press conference in Tehran.  “The Astana platform is a very important platform. It can provide assistance and encouragement to the political process in Geneva – which is concentrating mainly on political issues, including the draft of the constitution, the election and the governors, the formation of a transition authority,” he explained in English in reply to a question by The Tehran Times.  China has not been directly engaged in the Syrian crisis, on for six years now, but has vetoed a few times anti-Syria resolutions in the United Nations Security Council.  The envoy voiced support for a “political settlement” and “negotiations” to reach a final solution to the conflict, underscoring that military solution “leads nowhere.”  Asked if Beijing could have played a more prominent role in the deadly civil conflict, Xie said his country has already been so.  “Our main role so far has been to encourage dialogue, negotiations between the relevant parties, namely the government on one side and the opposition groups on the other side. That is, I think, not an easy task.”  The envoy also appeared optimistic towards the agreement forged between Russia and the U.S. on Syria, hailing it as “a step forward in the right direction.”  U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin reached an agreement on curbing violence in southwest Syria during their sitdown at the G20 meeting on July 8 in Germany.
