A cluster of pilgrims walk in a scenic mountainous route that leads to the shrine of Khalid Nabi in Golestan province near the border with Turkmenistan, April 29, 2017. The modest shrine, surmounted by a tiny cone-shaped dome, is seen in the foreground atop a greenish pick. The shrine is adjacent to the ancient Khalid Nabi cemetery, itself a source of charm for the region in northeast Iran. The cemetery is now a national heritage site protected by the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization.
