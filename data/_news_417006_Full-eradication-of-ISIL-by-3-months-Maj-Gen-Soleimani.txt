TEHRAN –The commander of Iran’s Quds forces fighting with ISIL terrorists in Iraq and Syria vowed the full eradication of the ISIL by the next three months. “Iran’s Leader, and the selfless youth are the keys to the success against the plots laid by enemies,” asserted Major General Qassem Soleimani, the Commander of IRGC Quds Force, on Thursday. “When the logic of your opponent is that killing you is a religious mandate and the more they kill you the close the get to heaven, in such a situation, diplomatic efforts are meaningless,” highlighted the Iranian commander, referring to the ideology of Takfirist terrorists like ISIL. “When the opponent does not see a difference between armed warriors and defenseless civilians, however innocent the killed are, the only way left to encounter them is war.”  The Iranian senior commander reiterated that the ulterior goal of the creators of the ISIL was to eliminate Iran and in such an equation Iran could not wait for the destruction of Iraq and Syria to let the ISIL stage war against Iran.   “I have said before, we will take revenge from the ISIL for all the youth of us killed by them, and the elimination of the ISIL is certain by three months later,” articulated the Iranian formidable warrior.  “We continuously land our blows on the body of the ISIL, and soon, the Muslims of the region will celebrate the end of this cancer tumor created by US and Israel,” stated the commander. “This victory solely belongs to the governments, nations, and Leaders of Iran, Iraq, and Syria and all the young warriors at resistance fronts, and with the Divine auspices we will soon witness this great victory,” reassured General Soleimani.
