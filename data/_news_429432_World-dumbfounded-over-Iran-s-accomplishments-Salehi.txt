TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), said on Sunday that Iran’s achievements in defense, missile and nuclear industries have left the world “dumbfounded”. During a visit to Qazvin, Salehi said U.S. sanctions will not stop Iran’s progress. “The Iranian nation, since the victory of the Islamic Revolution, has become accustomed to the sanctions, and U.S. policy is not a new issue for the country,” IRNA quoted him as saying. “Iran has reached many achievements over the past 40 years after the Islamic Revolution despite all the pressure, constraints, eight years of the imposed war (Iran-Iraq war), and crippling sanctions,” he remarked.
