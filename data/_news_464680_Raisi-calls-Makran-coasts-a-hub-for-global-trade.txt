The president said that Makran coasts were among the best capacities for investment, noting that one of the first steps in this field was the accurate and complete introduction of investment capacities in the Makran region.  "The administration views Makran as a region that can play a constructive role in increasing production and employment as two very important issues of the country and investment has a very clear and good future in Makran," Raisi concluded. Elsewhere in his remarks, the president referred to the issue of establishing a university of medical sciences in the region and stated: "This issue is one of the subjects that will be on the agenda to pursue." Raisi also praised the IRGC, Basij, police, army and border guards in the navy, ground and air forces for their efforts to ensure the security of the region. "All the people of the region play a role in creating security in the region, for which I am sincerely grateful.
