TEHRAN â€“ The number of Iranians visiting Serbia is expected to rise as the southeastern European country has recently decided to waive visa requirement for Iranian nationals. The decision will enable undisturbed arrival of tourists, as well as potential investors, in order to create a more favorable business environment, and bring bilateral relations to a higher level, InSerbia reported on August 23. Earlier this month, Maja Gojkovic, the president of the National Assembly of Serbia, vowed to put to vote in parliament lifting visa restrictions for Iranian travelers, Tasnim reported. She made the remarks in meeting with Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani in Tehran, during which the officials explored ways to widen relations in various arenas, and tourism in particular.
