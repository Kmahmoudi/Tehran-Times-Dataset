TEHRAN - When the pro-reform candidates for the fifth Tehran city council election on May 19 captured all 21 seats, speculations ran rife as who would be chosen the capital’s next mayor. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a principlist who has been the mayor of Tehran for almost 12 years, is now nearing the end of his rather lengthy career and now with all seats at the city council won by reformists, a heated discussion is revolving around Tehran’s would-be mayor. As announced by councilor Majid Farahani, the city council has so far put up 30 candidates. “Over a session which will be held on Wednesday, five candidates with the highest votes would be selected to submit their plans. Eventually, two final candidates will vie for the office,” ISNA quoted Farahani as saying.   Below is a brief introduction to some names who stand out among the prospective candidates.  Mohammad Ali Najafi As a former education minister, Mohammad Ali Najafi, 66, has served as vice-president and head of the Budget and Planning Organization.  Hossein Mar’ashi Serving as a member of the parliament, the 60-year-old Hossein Mar’ashi was a former director of the Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization, and Kerman province governor general.
