TEHRAN - The military exchanges between the two regional giants and economic powers India and China have grown rapidly following this year’s meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan, Indian envoy to China said. Gautam Bambawale hailed it as a “good development” and said it will help solve issues between the two neighboring countries. “Strategic communication is important not merely between the top leadership of our countries but also between our diplomats, our military officers and our trade negotiators,” he said at the fifth dialogue between the Indian Council of World Affairs and the Chinese People's Institute for Foreign Affairs. “After Wuhan, our military exchanges have not merely resumed but grown rapidly. Our military commanders are now talking to each other more frankly and more candidly than ever before,” the envoy said, as reported by India’s state-run news agency PTI. He said India has recently launched the International Solar Alliance with a view to expand the use of solar energy by providing developing countries with technology, expertise and finance. “China herself is a leading player in the development and spread of solar energy. India has invited China to join the International Solar Alliance. We hope China will do so soon,” Bambawale said. India is making a pitch for tourists as only 300,000 of over 144 million Chinese tourists who travelled abroad visited India last year whereas over 1.4 million Indians travelled to China, the report stated.
