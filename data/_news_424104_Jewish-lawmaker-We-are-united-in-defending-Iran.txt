TEHRAN - Iranian Jewish lawmaker Siamak Moreh Sedgh said on Wednesday that enemies should know that Iranians are ready to defend the country unitedly.
 “We should maintain this unity, solidarity and integrity. We should not let ideological differences be used by the enemies as a tool to create division in the country,” the Jewish parliamentarian told IRNA. He noted that the people and officials are duty bound to maintain “national unity and integrity”. “The constitution and the Leader of the revolution have been the main principles of the Islamic Republic system since the victory of the Islamic Revolution and have also been the main axes of unity and solidarity in Iran,” he noted. Elsewhere, he said that the U.S. sanctions are against all the Iranian people and not just a certain religious or ethnic group. “We should move unitedly and defend our country’s national interests and values,” he asserted. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the international nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, and is going to reintroduce sanctions against Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in speech at the Heritage Foundation on May 21 that the U.S. will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic.
