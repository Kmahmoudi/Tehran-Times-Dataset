TEHRAN – Tehran and Beijing have started brainstorming sessions on the re-designing of Arak reactor under the terms of the nuclear deal Tehran and the 5+1 group of countries forged in July 2015.  The technical meetings are a follow-up to the talks held between Iranian and Chinese expert panels in Beijing previously, according to Behrooz Kamalvandi.  
Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran will modernize the Arak heavy water research reactor to support peaceful nuclear
research and radioisotopes production for medical and industrial purposes. 
The cooperation will be on the basis of the JCPOA where Iran and 5+1 countries have agreed on the establishment of a Working Group composed of E3/EU+3 participants to facilitate the redesigning and rebuilding of the reactor.
Iran and China signed an agreement on the modernization project during the visit to Iran of Chinese President Xi Jinping in January.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
