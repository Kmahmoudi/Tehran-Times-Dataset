TEHRAN – The number of tourists who visited natural and historical attractions in Lorestan province, western Iran, rose nearly 30 percent during the first four and a half months of the current Iranian calendar year (started March 21, 2017) in comparisons to the same period last year, the province’s tourism chief says. Touristic, historical and cultural spots across Lorestan attracted some 4.2 million people during the above-mentioned time span, ISNA quoted Gholamreza Soleymani as saying on Wednesday. The official put the number of night stays at province’s hotels, guesthouses and eco-lodges at over 650,000, an increase of ten percent year on year. The number comprises both foreign and domestic sightseers as a whole, he said without providing further details. Bisheh Waterfall, Snow Tunnel, Poldokhtar ponds, Falak-ol-Aflak Castle, Soltani Mosque of Borujerd, Shapouri Bridge, and Shirez Canyon are amongst tourist sites of the mountainous province.
