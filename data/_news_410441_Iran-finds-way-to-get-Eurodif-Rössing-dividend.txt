TEHRAN - Iran has found a way to receive arrear dividends from European consortium Eurodif and the Namibia-based Rössing Uranium Ltd. which had been blocked due the country’s nuclear program, ISNA reported on Wednesday. Iran’s dividend in Eurodif has not been paid since 2006, however, the implementation of the nuclear deal in January 2016 paved the way for Iran to receive its share which is estimated to be around 54 million euros.  Meanwhile, Iran had a 15-percent share in Rössing in the 1970s. But, the country has not been successful in receiving its dividend yet.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
