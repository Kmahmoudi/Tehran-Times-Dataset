TEHRAN - Yahya Rahim Safavi, a top military adviser to the Leader, said on Tuesday that Iran has “precise information” that the U.S. is transferring Daesh militants to Afghanistan.
 In a ceremony held to mark the 40th anniversary of victory of the Islamic Revolution, Safavi also said the U.S. and Zionist regime’s power is on the wane “but Iran’s power is increasing and we are now a regional power.”  Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in January 2018 that the U.S. is trying to justify its presence in the region by relocating Daesh from Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan. “They were defeated, previously, in Iraq and Syria. Now, they seek to ignite terror all over again in Afghanistan,” the Leader said, according to khamenei.ir.
