He asked Shia and Sunni Muslims to join hands to prevent sectarian strife in Iraq, the Beirut-based As-Safir newspaper quoted him as saying in his weekly message. He called for all Shia and Sunni ulema to unite, adding the ulema can revive fraternity between Shias and Sunnis. “I want the Sunni ulema to condemn the branding of Shias as takfiris, and I warn all Sunnis against entering into such matters.” Akef warned that Washington is trying to use the Shia-Sunni divide as a first step to reinforce animosity toward Tehran.
