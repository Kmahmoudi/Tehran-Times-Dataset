TEHRAN - The Iranian Parliament's Committee for Internal Affairs and Councils will release its final report on Mahsa Amini's passing by Tuesday, the parliamentary committee chairman Mohammad Saleh Jokar announced on Saturday.  Amini, a 22-year-old Saghez resident who had fallen at a police station on September 13 while visiting Tehran with her brother, passed away on September 16 at hospital. Her passing provoked riots in certain Iranian cities, which subsequently devolved into clashes that the government of Iran attributed to outside forces. Based on Jokarâ€™s remarks, the parliamentary committee has assessed reports that have already been prepared by various organizations and has also requested that the Forensic Medicine submit its own report on the circumstances surrounding Amini's death. The legislator stated that the committee would carefully review the Forensic Medicine's report before drafting its own by Tuesday. The committee is compiling a report in response to an order issued by Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf soon after Amini's death to investigate what happened to the young woman. In accordance with a report released on Friday by Forensic Medicine, Amini died from an underlying ailment rather than being struck in the skull, critical organs, or bodily limbs.
