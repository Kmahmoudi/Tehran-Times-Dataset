Meanwhile, in its monthly oil market report for September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reported that Iranian heavy crude average price stood at $47.30 pb in November falling $4.88 compared to the preceding month.
OPEC which accounts for a third of global oil supply, agreed in Vienna on November 30 to cut production from January by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), or over 3 percent, to 32.5 million bpd.
The cut will put production at the low end of a preliminary agreement struck in Algiers in September, and will reduce output from a current 33.64 million bpd. EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
