TEHRAN – The Islamic Republic of Iran and the Iranian nation will frustrate America in all arenas, the Leader said on Tuesday. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the remark during a meeting of members of the Council of Coordination on Islamic Propagation. “The American government is trying to divide Iran. It is also profiting from help of some wealthy states in our region. They must know that we will advance, powerfully, with Divine favor, just as we did when we defeated them in our region. Just as we rubbed their noses into dirt, we will go forward with great power. With Divine permission, we will frustrate America in all arenas,” he stated. “We are approaching the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, which was able to disrupt the structure of power and domination in the world. It proved that there could be a nation that is neither domineering nor dominated,” the Leader noted. “Enemies continue with their hostile measures today. It is important to understand, in each episode of this propaganda, economic, cultural and security war, what the enemy’s next move will be, in order to counteract it with a pre-emptive defense or attack,” he added. “America is still supporting Daesh and others like them …, the cruel House of Saud in his crimes against Yemen, and the Zionist regime in their crimes against Palestine.” “The enemy is lying and exaggerating with its propaganda. At the beginning of the revolution, they said the Islamic Republic would be overthrown within six months. They saw this was not the case; then, they said it would happen within two years. Now the Islamic Republic is 40 years old and extremely powerful. Ayatollah Khamenei further described the soft war as more dangerous than a military war, urging the officials to exercise vigilance against such threats against Iran. “Our main enemy, the American regime, rules one of the most corrupt and most oppressive countries. It supports terrorists. According to reports, it’s still supporting Daesh and others like them. The American government supports the cruel House of Saud in his crimes against Yemen, and it supports the Zionist regime in their crimes against Palestine,” Ayatollah Khamenei said. He also referred to the fate of the Islamic Awakening movements in some Arab and North African countries, which led to sedition, civil wars or religious and ethnic disputes, and said, “The Iranian people have passed through all these stages proudly and powerfully.” Commenting on the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump in comparison to former presidents, Ayatollah Khamenei said, “Reagan was craftier, more powerful, and of course wiser than the present guy. Reagan’s administration took measures against Iran; they shot down one of our passenger aircrafts. But now he will be judged before God while the Islamic Republic is moving along more powerfully.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
