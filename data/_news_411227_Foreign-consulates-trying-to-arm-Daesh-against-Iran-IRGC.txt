TEHRAN – Some foreign consulates outside Iranian borders have been trying to help and equip Daesh terrorists against Iran, Mohammad Pakpour, commander of the Ground Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, said on Saturday.

 “However, they have failed to do anything, thanks to the IRGC’s preparedness,” Fars quoted Pakpour as saying.  He added, “Daesh terrorists are in Iraq’s Diyala Governorate and surely like approaching Iranian borders, but they dare not come nearer because we will smash them.”  SP/PA
