TEHRAN – The United Nations office in Tehran officially launched the start of a campaign on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in Iran under the title of “Together for SDGs” on Tuesday. Maria Dotsenko, director of the United Nations Information Centre in Iran, said the campaign is aimed at raising public awareness on UN SDGs in the country, speaking to a press conference. 
“The campaign was a tremendous joint effort of a group of enthusiastic and dedicated professionals, [celebrities] who work on pro-bono basis, since they truly believe in UN Agenda on Sustainable Development Goals,” she noted.   
At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit on 25 September 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty and hunger, improving health and education, making cities more sustainable, fight inequality and injustice, and tackle climate change, and protecting oceans and forests by 2030. 
Iran is also among countries that adopted the historic document titled “Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” 
Dotsenko called the date of the press conference symbolic, saying, “It coincides with the opening of the 71st Session of UN General Assembly in New York.” 
On the same day, the campaign on UNIC social media Telegram was also kicked off by Dotsenko. The campaign can also be found on Aparat, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn. 
She then expressed her gratitude to individuals and municipal officials who got involved in setting up some billboards in Tehran, promoting SDGs.
