TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Iran proposes referendum among the native Palestinians as the solution to the Palestine issue.
 “Doesn’t this proposal of the Islamic Republic which has been registered officially in the United Nations conform to the principles which are accepted by the world? Then why aren’t the Europeans prepared to consider it?” Ayatollah Khamenei asked during a meeting with hundreds of professors, faculty members and researchers from universities and academic centers. He also criticized the Europeans’ silence towards the crimes committed by the Zionist regime of Israel against Palestinians. “We have always said that to determine the type of government in historical country of Palestine, we should refer to the public opinion based on a method which is accepted by the whole world and conduct a poll and referendum among all the true Palestinians including Muslims, Jews and Christians who have been in this land inside or outside the occupied territories for at least 80 years,” the Leader stated. Pointing to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent European tour, the Leader described Netanyahu as the present day’s Shimr (the villain who beheaded Imam Hussain). “This criminal (Netanyahu) who is the worst tyrant in history lied to Europeans and said that Iran seeks to annihilate us [Israelis] and millions of Jews while our solution to the Palestine issue is totally based on logic and conforms to principles of democracy,” Ayatollah Khamenei notes.“This criminal who is the worst tyrant in history lied to Europeans and said that Iran seeks to annihilate us [Israelis] and millions of Jews while our solution to the Palestine issue is totally based on logic and conforms to principles of democracy,” he said. Elsewhere, the Leader said that Iran faces the greatest number of enemies among the “arrogant” and “worthless” governments. He added that “evil enemies” constantly seek to hatch plot against Iran but they have always been defeated and will face defeat in the future. ‘%20 uranium enrichment is example of capability’ The Leader also told the academicians that success to enrich uranium to the purity level of 20 percent is an example of the Iranian youths’ capability and talent. “During a period of time when they had set conditions to sell enriched uranium to the 20 percent purity and a number of officials inclined to give concessions in this regard, we could achieve 20-percent [enriched] uranium through resistance, resilience and the youths’ efforts and the world watched in utter disbelief that we do not need the U.S., Russian and French uranium,” he explained. Elsewhere, he said that problems in the country should be solved “wisely” and through using the capacity of universities and talents of professors and the youth.
