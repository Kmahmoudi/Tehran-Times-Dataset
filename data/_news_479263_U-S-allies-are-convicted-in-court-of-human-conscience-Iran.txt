TEHRAN - As a result of their "shameful" track record, the United States and its allies, according to the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, are "convicted in the court of human conscience" for their “despicable historical conduct”. In a series of tweets on Thursday, Nasser Kanaani made the comment while including images of the brutal treatment of prisoners at the infamous U.S.-run Guantanamo prison and former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who killed African American George Floyd during a violent arrest in May 2020. He stated, “Those with record of committing crimes against other nations and backing an occupier and terrorist regime, don't have moral/legal right to comment on human rights in other countries. HR is a sacred value and Iran believes that it’s Islamic, humane, legal and moral imperative to promote it.” “Those HR violators are better to look at their own shameful record and stop political and instrumental use of human rights. U.S. gov and many other self-proclaimed advocates of human rights are convicted in the court of human conscience because of their despicable historical conduct,” said another tweet. The Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council met on November 24 at the request of Germany and Iceland to investigate alleged abuses of human rights in Iran in regard to the handing of the uprisings that erupted on September 16 following the death of Mahsa Amini. In its resolution the UNHRC decided to form a multinational fact-finding team to look into the alleged atrocities. The so-called fact-finding mission will not get Tehran's cooperation, according to the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which also emphasized that Tehran has already established a national fact-finding commission to investigate the incidents. Since Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died suddenly in hospital on September 16, three days after fainting at a police station, protests erupted in a few Iranian cities. Based on a forensic examination, Amini died because of a chronic illness rather than reported blow to her head or other vital organs. The protests over the tragic death turned violent which took the lives of dozens of security personnel as well as citizens.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
