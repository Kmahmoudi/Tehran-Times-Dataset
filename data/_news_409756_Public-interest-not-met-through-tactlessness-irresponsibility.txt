TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that the interests of the people would not be met through “tactlessness” and “irresponsibility”, ISNA reported. Rouhani made the remarks in a meeting with members of the Parliament Planning and Budget Committee, where the sides exchanged views on the important economic and political issues. Rouhani said that one of the goals of his administration has been to stabilize economy. Creating turmoil and deepening the disagreements in the society is destructive to the country’s political atmosphere, he added. “In order to develop a healthy society, it is necessary that people be able to experience calm and stability in the economy and political arena, and the government will do everything in its power to bring back calm to the economy and remove tensions from the political atmosphere,” the president added. Elsewhere in his remarks, Rouhani pointed to the case of Babak Zanjani – a well-known billionaire who is facing charges of corruption – saying, “It is the public’s right to know who decided to give such huge sums of money to a person (Zanjani); how it happened; and where the money is right now.” He also said his administration has been pursuing the issue since the beginning of his tenure as president, adding that the Judiciary has a serious responsibility in this case.
