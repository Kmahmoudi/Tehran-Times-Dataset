TEHRAN – The Fatemiyoun Brigade, an all-Afghan unit fighting Daesh (ISIS) and other Takfiri terrorists in Syria, has made major gains against terrorists in Deir Ez-Zor province, the commander of the brigade has said. Seaking to Tasnim, the commander said the Fatemiyoun Brigade, as part of the resistance forces, is advancing toward the strategic district of al-Mayadeen in Deir Ez-Zor. He also dismissed as “a sheer lie” some reports that the resistance forces have been under siege by Daesh terrorists.
