Syrian President Bashar Assad said on Friday that the liberation of Aleppo was "a key part of the whole anti-terrorist operation in Syria. During the week, Assad met with members of Russia's Federation Council and members of the European Parliament (MEPs), Tass reported. Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Federation Council's International Affairs Committee, told Russian journalists on Friday about the results of the visit to Damascus. The lawmaker told TASS that the Syrian leadership thought that the success in Aleppo "has become a turning point which would allow dramatically changing the situation in the country and firmly moving toward achieving complete victory over terrorism and launching a political process." "Our trip to Syria and talks with Bashar Assad coincided with ceasefire declared on the whole territory as a result of an agreement with Turkey and Iran," Kosachev said. He added that Assad thought that the agreement on ceasefire lays a long-term basis for stabilizing the situation in the country. "From the point of view of the Syrian leader, this powerful construction allows to bring all participants in this process to those positions that are now associated with Russia's approaches, i.e. focus attention on countering terrorism and avoiding interference into domestic affairs of Syria," Kosachev stressed.Â  (source: Farsnews) All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
