TEHRAN – The centuries-old bazaar of Khoy, a tourist destination in a city of the same name in northwest Iran, has been restored to its former glory. Implemented by West Azarbaijan province’s cultural heritage, tourism and handicrafts department, a sum of three billion rials (about $75,000) was channeled into the project, Mehr reported on Wednesday. Various parts of the massive mudbrick structure including its pillars, foundation, ceiling plasters and ornamentations were restored based on the original specs. The Safavid-era (1501–1736) bazaar complex features a labyrinth of interconnected covered passages with a myriad of shops. It also contains four caravanserais. The relatively broad vaulted passageways in traditional bazaars are designed to ensure the interior remains cool in summer and warm in wintertime. Khoy has long been a melting pot of cultural exchange and trade center on the ancient Silk Road.
