TEHRAN- Iran’s exports to Iraq rose 31 percent during the first half of the present Iranian calendar year (March 21-September 22), according to the Chairman of Iran-Iraq Joint Chamber of Commerce Yahya Al-e Es’haq. He put the value of Iran’s exports to the neighboring country at $4.165 billion in the first six-month period of this year, IRIB reported. There are many potentials for the expansion of trade between the two countries, Al-e Es’haq said, saying that now is the best time for presence in the Iraqi market. Although, as he said previously, there is a long way for Tehran and Baghdad to go and there are several barriers including some bureaucratic difficulties.
