Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says a second referendum may be held after the April constitutional reforms vote over the continuing of EU accession talks.

 "Right now we are holding a referendum on April 16 and after that we could choose to do a second one on the [EU] accession talks and we would abide by whatever our people would say there," said Erdogan during Turkish-British Tatlıdil Forum held in Antalya on Saturday. Turkey is set hold a referendum on the constitutional amendments, including giving executive powers to the president, currently a ceremonial post, and abolishing the office of the prime minister. The country applied for membership in the European Union in 1987, and began formal accession negotiations in 2005. Since then the talks have made little progress over Turkey’s human rights track record. "You [Britain] have made a decision with Brexit, there may be different things after April 16," said Erdogan in reference to a June 2016 referendum in the UK in which voters supported the country's exit from the EU.   Earlier in the day, he stated that it would be "easier" if the EU just rejected Turkey's bid to join the bloc.     All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
