TEHRAN – In response to a recent letter by Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a letter on Wednesday insisting on Iran’s long held position in fully supporting Palestine and its resistance forces against the Israeli regime.
 The Leader said the solution to the Palestinian problem is empowering the resistance forces and intensifying the campaign against the occupying regime of Israel and its backers. In part of his letter, Ayatollah Khamenei said, “Move toward negotiations with the deceitful and occupying regime is an unforgiveable great mistake that will only put off the victory of the Palestinian nation.” Elsewhere in his letter to Haniyeh, the Leader said, “We consider ourselves duty bound to give you any kind of help”.
