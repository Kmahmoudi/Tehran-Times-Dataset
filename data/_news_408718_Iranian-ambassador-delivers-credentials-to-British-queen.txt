TEHRAN - Iran’s Ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeedinejad, met with Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday and delivered his credentials to her.
 “The new situation in the contemporary world and the challenges that it has created for Asia, Europe, the U.S. and Mideast were discussed in the meeting,” Baeedinejad posted on his Instagram page. Queen Elizabeth II received the credentials and expressed hope that expansion of ties and cooperation would benefit the Iranian and British people, he wrote. The Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Kingdom restored their diplomatic relations to the highest level by assigning and dispatching their ambassadors to the other country each in September. Nicholas Hopton has been appointed as British ambassador to Iran. The two countries resumed their ties about a year ago by assigning chargés d’affaires. The two had closed their diplomatic missions in 2011. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
