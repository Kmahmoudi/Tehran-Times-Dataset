Entrepreneurship has come under the spotlight in many countries over the past decades and it has prompted the governments to adopt some new policies for promotion of entrepreneurship in their societies. Institutionalizing the culture of entrepreneurship, as well as supporting and motivating the entrepreneurs have been some successful approaches in this due. While the public view on the issue of entrepreneurship is that it is a duty of the governments, many experts believe that although the government should lay the proper ground and develop the necessary infrastructures, the private sector is in fact in charge of entrepreneurship in the societies. In Iran, the chambers of commerce, as some independent business supporting organizations, always endeavor to facilitate business environment for the businessmen and traders through preparing the required infrastructures and laying the necessary ground for their activities. Creating incentives for the entrepreneurs is also added to the efforts of the chambers to elevate the national economy through promotion of entrepreneurship in the country.
