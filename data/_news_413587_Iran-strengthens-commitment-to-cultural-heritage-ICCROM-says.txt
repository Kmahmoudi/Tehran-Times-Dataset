TEHRAN – Iran reaffirms deeper commitment to preserving its cultural heritage as the country extends restorations projects to beyond its borderlines, the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) announced on its website on May 18. The comment comes after the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization revealed plans to allocate $2.4 million towards the conservation of sites around the world linked to Iranian heritage. Earlier this month, the two establishments signed a memorandum of understanding in a bid to strength collaboration in cultural heritage conservation between ICCROM and Iran, a member state since 1972. The agreement also sets the basis for organizing professional training activities, workshops and other activities to raise public awareness and support for conservation. According to the ICCROM, the center is seeking new sources of funding, including from the private sector, to implement projects in Iran and the region starting this year.  PHOTO: ICCROM Director-General Stefano De Caro (L) talks to Iran’s tourism chief Zahra Ahmadipour in Tehran, May 3, 2017.
