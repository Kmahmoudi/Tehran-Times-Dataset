 “We are making arrangements for further cooperation on combatting dust storms, energy management and water efficiency,” Ebtekar explained. Ebtekar made the remarks over a joint press conference with the French Minister of the Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs, Ségolène Royal, here on Sunday. “The French minister has come to Iran at my invitation and we have discussed bilateral and multilateral cooperation following a memorandum of understanding signed over President Hassan Rouhani’s trip to France,” she added. Mentioning the upcoming 16th International Environment Exhibition scheduled to be held on February 25 to 28, Ebtekar stated that through the negotiations with the minister French companies both in private and public sector are willing to attend the event.
