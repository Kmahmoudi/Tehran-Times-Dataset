TEHRAN – The former Iranian ambassador to Azerbaijan has said that Iran-Russia ties are not comparable to those of the Qajar and Pahlavi eras since the interests of the two countries coincide.  Mohsen Pak-Aeen made the remarks in an interview with Mehr news agency published on Monday. Referring to the bitter memories of Iran-Russia ties under the Qajar, he said, “Russia has transformed from the great Russian Empire to a country; and on the other hand Iran is not the same country as it was during the Qajar and Pahlavi periods.” The Russian Empire inflicted two treaties, the Treaty of Gulistan and Treaty of Turkmenchay, on Persia (modern day Iran) in 1813 and 1828 respectively. The terms of the treaties were humiliating, costing Iran all of its holdings in the Caucasus, comprised of modern-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and Dagestan, which for centuries were part and parcel with Iranian national identity. Pak-Aeen also said Tehran’s relations with Russia is in its most favorable condition. “Trust is built among countries whose interests are consistent with each other, and those countries with inconsistent interests would lose trust and move apart,” Pak-Aeen stated. Elsewhere in his remarks, he hailed Iran’s win-win foreign policy as the right approach under which trust is established between two countries, adding that Iran-Russia ties are based on such policy that secures both sides’ interests.  “It can be said with certainty that relations between Iran and Russia have not been as good and positive as of today’s, because the two countries share harmonious political and security interests in the region and have common economic concerns” as the two countries have been subjected to Western sanctions, Pak-Aeen noted. He also said the two sides intend to create new economic opportunities. Iran and Russia have also developed very close military and security relationship, he said. MH/PA
