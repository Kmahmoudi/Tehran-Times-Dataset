TEHRAN – The Islamic Republic of Iran Railways has launched a tourism train   service across the southeastern Kerman province, ISNA reported on Thursday. The train route, which takes sightseers to the UNESCO-registered Bam citadel, ancient Rayen Castle and some other historical and natural destinations, made its debut last week. One and two-day tours have been projected for the package trips, which are operated under the supervision of the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, the report said. The big and sprawling province has been a cultural melting pot since antiquity, blending Persians with subcontinental tribe dwellers. It is home to myriad historical sites and scenic landscapes such as Bazaar-e Sartasari, Jabalieh Dome, Ganjali Khan Bathhouse, Malek Jameh Mosque and Shahdad Desert to name a few.
