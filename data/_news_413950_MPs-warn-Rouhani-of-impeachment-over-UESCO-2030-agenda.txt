TEHRAN – 12 MPs on Wednesday wrote a cautionary letter to President Hassan Rouhani and asked him to desist from following UNECO 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

 The lawmakers warned that they would put on agenda the impeachment of Rouhani if he does not back off, Fars reported. The signatories chastised the president for insisting on implementing the agenda instead of apologizing to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for having initiated its implementation in the first place.
