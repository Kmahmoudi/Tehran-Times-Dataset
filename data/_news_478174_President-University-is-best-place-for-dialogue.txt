TEHRAN — In a meeting with university chancellors on Saturday evening, President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran said universities are among the “best places” for dialogue.  Raisi described universities as “dynamic” places that disappoint the enemies of Iran through “the power of science”. He added when it is said that the university is “political” it means that it “must know the society and its needs more and better than any other sector.”  The president went on to describe university as the best place for dialogue and discussion about the recent incidents in Iran and offering solutions. “The most important precondition for such dialogue is the correct understanding of issues. If the issues are not analyzed well, they will be affected by the atmosphere created by the media and cyberspace” and this “leads to error,” the president remarked. Stating that the war today is the war of narratives, the president said the enemy had tried a lot to stop the country's scientific and industrial progress, undermine production and service sectors and also cut Iran's connection with other countries. “The enemy has announced it clearly that it would try to reduce Iran's oil sales to zero but in the current conditions, the country's oil export has become closer to the figures before the sanctions,” he said. Raisi added that alongside these advancements, there are some shortcomings and issues in answering the problems in the minds of the academics.
