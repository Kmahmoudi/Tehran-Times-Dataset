TEHRAN – On Saturday, Iran welcomed the newest UN Security Council resolution that condemns Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories as illegal, ISNA reported. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said the move is a sign of the international community’s determination in ending the Zionist regime’s occupation and restoring the rights of the Palestinian people. “The Islamic Republic of Iran would welcome any measure that supports the legitimate demands of Palestinians, strengthens the international status of Palestine and opposes the Zionist regime’s occupation and its expansionist policies,” Qassemi said in a statement. He further said that the Islamic Republic has on numerous occasions emphasized that the Israeli settlement expansion is a “flagrant” violation of international law. Expressing satisfaction with growing international awareness regarding Israeli crimes against Palestinians, Qassemi said, “As far as we are concerned, the resolution of the Palestinian issue requires serious and decisive measures by the international community to fulfill the rights of the innocent Palestinian people and to fight the Zionist regime’s expansionist policies.” He also called on the United Nations to take major steps in this regard. Qassemi’s remarks came a day after the United States refused to veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement expansion. The body approved the resolution with 14 votes in favor and one abstention – being the U.S. – on Friday. The resolution was initially drafted by Egypt, but following extraordinary pressure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu through the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Egypt withdrew from pursuing the case. On Friday, however, Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela put the resolution forward again. The resolution calls on Israel to “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem al-Quds.” It also says that Israeli settlement construction has “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.” Among many others in the U.S, Trump was infuriated by the Obama administration’s decision to abstain from the UNSC vote. In a tweet after the resolution was approved, he said, “As to the UN, things will be different after Jan. 20th.” The White House said on Friday that President Obama made the final decision, and urged Trump to respect “the one president at a time” concept. Netanyahu’s office has also condemned the resolution as “shameful”, saying Israel looks forward to working with Trump, as well as “Israeli-friendly members of Congress, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.” Meanwhile, the Palestinians were joyful with their infrequent diplomatic victory. "This is a victory for the people and for the cause, and it opens doors wide for the demand of sanctions on settlements," CNN quoted Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian leader, as saying.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
