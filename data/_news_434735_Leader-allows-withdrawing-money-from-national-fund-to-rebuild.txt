TEHRAN - Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei has said that the government must take essential steps to rebuild damages caused by the recent floods.
 In a letter published on Monday, he asked the government to use the available financial resources for the purpose. However, the Leader suggested the administration can withdraw money from the National Development Fund only if it is absolutely necessary. President Hassan Rouhani wrote a letter to the Leader on April 7 seeking permission to withdraw money from the NDF to reconstruct regions hit hard by flood. Ayatollah Khamenei urged the government to start necessary actions through using other resources, adding he will agree to withdraw from the NDF if needed. Since March 19, large parts of Iran have been inundated with flash floods. So far, about 76 people have lost their lives and hundreds of thousands been displaced. Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli has said that floods have left nearly $2.5 billion in damages. After nearly two decades of droughts in Iran, such heavy rainfalls and consequent flash floods have been unprecedented. Some experts have attributed the destructive floods to climate change.
