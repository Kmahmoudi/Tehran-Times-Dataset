TEHRAN - The former British Prime Minister doesn't have a good time! On the one hand, Tony Blair is witnessing the continuation of the Brexit process, and on the other hand, He's in no way happy with what has happened inside the Labor Party! Tony Blair is one of the main opponents of the British withdrawal from the European Union.  He has repeatedly stated that another referendum could be held, and, if the British citizens vote against the Brexit, the earlier results of the 2016 referendum can be ignored. He's gone a step further, and mentioned that the Brexit can never happen, even despite the public's vote for leaving the EU! Recently, British Prime Minister, Theresa May, expressed her satisfaction with the positive vote of the House of Commons to her plan for leaving the block. These remarks led to Tony Blair and his entourage taking positions against her. The UK former Prime Minister intended to use the Brexit to return to power in London and the Labor Party. In recent years, he has become the main messenger of the falsification of the Brexit.  However, the London-Brussels agreement on British exit from the EU can once again defeat Blair to in the country's political circles. The truth is that London's soft or hard exit from the EU is of no importance to Blair, but he's after the renewal of 2018's referendum. For the British prime minister, it does not matter that his country will leave Europe in the form of a "joint agreement" or "disagreement"!  UK's former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson and some other senior members of the conservative party, however, believe that the House of Commons shouldn't agree with London's soft withdrawals from the European Union. They believe that the agreement reached between Theresa May and the EU authorities over the Brexit will be heavily imbalanced and will lead to the economic domination of the United Europe on England over the next decade.  On the contrary, EU leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, have said they're not willing to offer British officials more advantages in their negotiations. They have emphasized that there would be no more talks on Brexit. Furthermore, the equation is much more complicated inside the Labor Party! Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition, has emphasized that by holding early elections and changing the government in London, it is possible to re-start the negotiations on Brexit with Brussels.  Beyond the debates that have raised among the conservatives and the Labor Party, Tony Blair is thinking about his own personal and political goals in the Labor Party and the Britain and international equations. Blair believes that if he can provide the ground for another referendum (and to prevent the realization of the Brexit), then his position will be restored among European politicians. It's obvious that Tony Blair is very dissatisfied with the current agreements reached between the British and EU authorities.  Jeremy Corbyn is trying to make an investigation into Tony Blair for alleged war crimes during the Iraq War, and this issue is seriously threatening Blair's political future. When Corbin was elected as the leader of the Labor Party, Blair could not hide his deep discontent in this regard. He has said Labor Party has undergone a “profound change” since Jeremy Corbyn became leader and he is not sure it will be possible for “moderates” to regain control of the party. “It is a different type of Labour party. Can it be taken back? I don’t know,” Blair said before. It should be noted that Jeremy Corbyn had previously called for the trial of George W. Bush and Tony Blair for committing war crimes during the invasion to Iraq. The main question is, what would be Tony Blair's next step in confronting his failures in the UK's political scene? Is he willing to use the Brexit as a means to revitalize his already-lost position? This question will be soon answered, but probably the stream of events won't be to Blair's benefit in the future.
