TEHRAN – Negotiation is underway with one or two European countries to purchase Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccines, Alireza Raisi, the spokesman for the National Headquarters for Coronavirus Control, has said. Referring to good efforts made to import vaccines, he said: “By the end of September, we will definitely import about 30 million doses of vaccine. With another memorandum of understanding from October, we will receive another 30 million doses. So, if we receive 60 million doses of vaccine, we can vaccinate the age group of 30 by the beginning of November.” By the end of September, 30 million doses of vaccine will be imported. Referring to the domestic vaccine production, he noted that within the next 3 weeks, there will be a significant increase in vaccine production, reaching 10 to 15 million doses by the end of September. Mass vaccination against COVID-19 started on Iranian citizens with the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine on February 9. While Iran continues efforts to mass-produce local candidates, over 18 million doses of foreign vaccines have already been imported and others are expected soon. Iran is also producing vaccines jointly with two countries of Cuba and Australia, which may also be released by September. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 14 vaccines are being domestically developed in the country which are in different study phases.
