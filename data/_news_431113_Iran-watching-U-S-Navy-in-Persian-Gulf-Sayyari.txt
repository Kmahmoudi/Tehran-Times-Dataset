TEHRAN – The U.S. Navy is under the close watch of the Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, Habibollah Sayyari, the deputy army chief for coordination affairs, said on Tuesday. Iran closely monitors anyone or any movement “in the realm of our region”, Sayyari told IRNA. “The region we are in has its owner.”  Iran will not allow any movement to be made in its territorial waters under the Islamic Republic’s sovereignty, he said. On regional developments, he said security in the region could be guaranteed only by regional countries.
