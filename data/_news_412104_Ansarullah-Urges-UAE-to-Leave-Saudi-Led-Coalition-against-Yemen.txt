TEHRAN  – Yemen's Houthi Ansarullah Movement called on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to reconsider its position on Yemen and leave the Saudi-led coalition that has killed thousands of civilians in the impoverished Arab country. In a statement on Monday, the Ansarullah Movement called on Abu Dhabi to review its military cooperation with the Saudi regime against Yemen, the online Arabic-language Ray al-Youm website reported. It came after UAE’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash, in a recent meeting with UN envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, said that the only solution to the Yemen conflict is through political means. Separately, Hisham Sharaf, the foreign minister of Yemen's National Salvation Government, recently called on the UAE to leave the coalition and end its sanctions against the Yemeni nation, Yemen’s Saba news agency reported. The Saudi-led coalition has been launching deadly airstrikes against the Houthi Ansarullah movement for two years in an attempt to restore power to the fugitive former President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. Some 11,000 Yemenis, including thousands of women and children, have lost their lives in the deadly military campaign.
