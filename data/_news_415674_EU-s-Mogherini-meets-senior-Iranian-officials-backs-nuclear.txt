TEHRAN – In her separate talks with senior Iranian officials on Saturday European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reiterated her bloc’s support for the international nuclear deal with Iran and expansion of ties.
 Mogherini visited Tehran to take part in a swearing-in ceremony for Hassan Rouhani as president for a second time. During her meeting with Rouhani, she said that the European delegation’s participation in the inauguration ceremony shows determination by the EU to expand ties with Tehran. Mogherini also said that the 2015 nuclear deal has brought great achievements for Iran and the EU, highlighting the importance of expanding relations in various spheres. For his part, Rouhani said, “Iran and the European Union have taken positive and important steps in line with expanding relations and cooperation, which are very important in a situation in which various parts of the world especially the Middle East are involved in clashes and complicated conflicts." Rouhani also insisted on the need to facilitate banking relations between Iran and the 28-nation European bloc. He also reiterated Tehran’s position in fulfilling its obligation under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – the official name for the nuclear agreement – noting Tehran will remain committed to the deal so as long as the other side does not violate it. Rouhani also pointed to violation of the JCPOA by the Trump administration and adoption of sanctions legislations against Iran by the two chambers of Congress, saying, “Repeated violations of the JCPOA by the U.S. administration and imposition of new sanctions against Iran have had negative effects on the public opinion in Iran which can in effect destroy the implementation of the JCPOA.”  Rouhani added, “Iran’s parliament will approve a legislation (against the U.S.) in a retaliatory action.” ‘EU supports implementation of nuclear deal’ During her meeting with Foreign Minister Zarif, Mogherini said that the European Union supports the implementation of the JCPOA. Zarif said that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to deprive Iran of the nuclear deal’s benefits. He also criticized Britain, France, and Germany for releasing a joint statement against Iran for launching a satellite-carrying rocket last month, describing the statement as a “move on the wrong path”. On July 27, Iran launched of Simorgh satellite-carrying rocket into space. Zarif noted that the launch of the rocket does not run contrary to the Resolution 2231 which endorsed the nuclear deal between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia. ‘Iran to counter U.S. contradictory position’  After his meeting with Mogherini, Ali Akbar Velayati told reporters that Iran will counter the U.S. “contradictory” position. Velayati, who acts as a senior advisor to the Leader on foreign policy issues, said the U.S. president constantly changes his stance which is harmful to his administration. He added that the nuclear agreement is international and the U.S. cannot act in whatever manner it desires.
