The ISF secretary general, who wrapped up his three-day Iran tour on September 3 said the federation has selected Iran as the first host to these three sporting fields of the world event. He added although the Asian and South European countries, say Greece, Turkey, and France, were keen to host the three fields, Iran was picked as the venue for holding the non-official (test) competitions in 2005. After two editions, the three fields will be officially included in ISF calendar. The ranking official added the World School Games is held in the fields of table tennis, skiing, track-and-field, gymnastics, badminton, football, volleyball, basketball, and handball every two years. The federation was established in Luxembourg in 1972 and its headquarters is now in Brussels, Belgium. Eighty countries are members of the International Schools Federation.
