TEHRAN – Given the desire of the Saudi side to receive pilgrims of Umrah al-Mufradah from Iran, authorities with Iran’s Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization have said that such progress is subject to the acceptance of the conditions of Iran from the Saudi side, Fars reported on Monday. According to the report, Saudi officials are attempting to meet Iran’s conditions in order to receive pilgrims from Iran for Umrah al-Mufradah pilgrimage. Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia was strained after hundreds of people, many of them Iranians, died in a stampede at the 2015 hajj rituals.
