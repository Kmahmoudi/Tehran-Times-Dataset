Shortly after Barack Obama's election, South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper ran a special issue depicting the president-elect as a superhero (Atlantic). But the newspaper's editorial page took a more measured tone, warning against viewing him as Africa's messiah. ""The only lesson we can learn from him is to reimagine the art of the possible,"" it said. Is Obama Africa's superhero, or just its role model? A number of analysts and U.S. policymakers say he will likely be something in between, devoting new diplomatic attention to the continent but not necessarily increased aid or military support.
