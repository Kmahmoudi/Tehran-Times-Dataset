TEHRAN – Zob Ahan of Iran beat Syrian basketball team Al-Ittihad Ahli 75-54 in the WASL West Asia League Group A on Thursday.

Al-Ittihad Ahli had a bit more help for Ronald Delph (17 points, 13 rebounds) in Chris Darrington (19 points) but there’s still a lot left to be desired from this Syrian squad who remain winless in WASL - West Asia play.
