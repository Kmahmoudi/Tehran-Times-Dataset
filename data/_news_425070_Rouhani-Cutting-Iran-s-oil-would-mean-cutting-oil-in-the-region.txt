TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani of Iran who started a tour of Switzerland and Austria on Monday has said the U.S. wants to fully prevent the export of Iranian oil, a move that the president said is impossible to implement because in that case no country in the region can export oil.
 Rouhani made the remarks at a meeting with a number of Iranian expatriates in Switzerland late on Monday. “It would be meaningless that Iran cannot export its oil while others in the region can. Do this if you can and see its consequences," Rouhani asserted. “We told all our foreign parties that if they speak to the Iranian nation with the language of logic and respect, then we can get problems solved... and that threats, pressure and humiliation will never work against the people of Iran," the president pointed out. In relation to the U.S. exit from the nuclear deal with Iran, Rouhani said, "Iran's logic has not changed, one party without logic has left the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with the goal of putting pressure on the Iranian nation."
