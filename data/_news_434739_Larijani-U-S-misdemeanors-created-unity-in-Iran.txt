TEHRAN – Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani has said Washington’s misdemeanors against the Islamic Republic have created an atmosphere of unity and harmony inside Iran. Such atmosphere is invaluable, though the Americans had other intentions in mind but failed to achieve their goals, Larijani said, Mehr reported on Monday. On April 8, U.S. President Donald Trump labeled Iran’s IRGC as a “foreign terrorist organization”. The move unified all Iranian political factions, with many hailing the IRGC as an “anti-terror” organization which has greatly contributed to regional stability.
