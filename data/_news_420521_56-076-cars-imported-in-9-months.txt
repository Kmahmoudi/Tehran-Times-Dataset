TEHRAN- Iran imported 56,076 cars valued at over $1.488 billion during the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-December 21, 2017), ISNA reported on Saturday citing the data by Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA). In last June, the Iranian government shut down the online auto import registration system saying that the import regulations are being revised. The system was run in late December and the government boosted import tariffs which seem to increase imported cars prices, but there are still controversies over the issue of tariffs in the country.
