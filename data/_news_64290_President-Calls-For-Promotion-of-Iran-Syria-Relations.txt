He hailed Syria as a harbinger of struggle against the Zionist regime and said the country's stances are source of hope for all those striving for liberation of their country from usurpation and occupation. Iranian nation and government have always been seeing Syrian government and nation besides itself in various phases of the revolution, said Khatami, adding that today too the path set by the great leaders of the two countries, i.e. Founder of the Islamic Republic and Father of the Islamic Revolution the late Imam Khomeini and former Syrian president the late Hafiz al-Assad, would be trodden by Iranian and Syrian governments and nations.

He added that his country is ready to continue expansion of economic and cultural ties with Iran. Meanwhile, President Khatami told Jeremy R. Newman, the new ambassador of Australia to Tehran, that Iran is ready to expand cooperation with Australian in all fields.
