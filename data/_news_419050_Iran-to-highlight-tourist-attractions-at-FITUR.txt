TEHRAN – A total of 22 Iranian travel-associated businesses and tour operators will promote handicrafts, traditions and tourism potentials of the country at the 38th FITUR tourism trade fair, which will be held in Madrid, Spain, from January 17 to 21. The Touring & Automobile Club of the Islamic Republic of Iran (TACI) under the auspices of the Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization will run the country’s pavilion at the event, Mehr reported on Sunday. “22 tourism companies and travel service providers will represent Iran in an exclusive pavilion.
