TEHRAN – The deputy chief of the Institute of the Commonwealth of Independent States believes a strong relationship between Tehran and Moscow would be the most proper response to U.S. President Donald Trump.

 “The U.S. tries to weaken ties between Iran and Russia, but comprehensive improvement of ties in all areas would be the best response,” Vladimir Yevsiyev told IRNA on Wednesday. He added Tehran and Moscow should boost cooperation especially over issues of concern in Syria, Afghanistan, Karabakh, and Tajikistan.
