TEHRAN – In a message on Tuesday, General Mohammad Hossein Baqeri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, hailed the Army, saying it has speeded up its combat readiness and defense power and demonstrated a good spirit of cooperation with other branches of the military. The message by the top general came one day before Iran marks Army Day. Baqeri said Army Day is reminiscent of the glorious moment in which the Islamic Republic of Iran Army was established almost 40 years ago with the aim of protecting the country’s independence and territorial integrity, Mehr reported. The Army is expected to continue its cooperation with other branches of the armed forces, observe all regional moves of the enemies, and continue to boost its defensive power against the threats, he pointed out. The Army and the IRGC, as two strong defense wings of the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic, will not allow the country’s clever strategy of resistance to be affected by the evil and adventurous thoughts of the United States and its Western and Arab allies, General Baqeri remarked. He also hailed the Army for acting under the guidance of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying the Army, in its blessed path, will not miss an opportunity to thrive and advance the ideals of the Islamic Revolution. The general also said the armed forces need to upgrade their preparedness in proportionate to the changing threats by the enemies.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
