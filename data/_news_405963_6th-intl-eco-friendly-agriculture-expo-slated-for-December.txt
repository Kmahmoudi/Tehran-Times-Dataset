TEHRAN — The 6th International Exhibition of Agriculture, Organic, Herbal, Natural Products and Technologies with eco-friendly approaches will set to work on December 6, 2016. The four-day exhibition which will be held in Tehran International Permanent Fairground is summed up by the slogan “new technologies, production boom, and export growth”, the public relations director of the exhibition has said. Amin Eftekhar noted that the exhibition is also an opportunity to indicate the liaison and mutual interests shared between agriculture sector and environment. “Introducing eco-friendly technologies such as new devices for irrigation and pesticides and fertilizers with the minimal damage caused to soil and water are of the exhibition objectives,” Eftekhar added. Stating the significance of green brands associated with environmental conservation and sustainable business practices he highlighted that Iran needs to move towards green brands to be able to maintain its place in the export market and that the exhibition would open up an ideal opportunity for Iran to work towards this goal. “Agriculture sector plays a key role in many countries’ economic growth, therefore devising effective and coherent strategies to establish a correlation between the environment and agriculture is what this exhibition focuses on,” Eftekhar explained. Exchanging information and experience in the field of new agricultural technologies in the post-sanction era is another focus of attention at this exhibition, he suggested. Eftekhar went on to say that workshops and professional meetings in attendance of experts, faculties, and researchers are also scheduled to be held on the sidelines of this event.
