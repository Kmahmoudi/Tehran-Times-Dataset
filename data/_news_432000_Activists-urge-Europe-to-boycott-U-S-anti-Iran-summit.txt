TEHRAN – A group of activists in the U.S. and other countries have signed a petition calling on European countries to boycott an anti-Iran summit set to be held by the U.S. in Poland next month, Press TV reported on Thursday. The activists have started the petition on the website of the anti-war group Code Pink to ask European countries not to attend the summit announced by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. More than 3,000 people have so far signed the online petition, which urges EU countries to skip Pompeo’s “belligerent conference” and “instead host an alternative one with all nations of the region, including Iran.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
