TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that Iran’s foreign policy is based on good neighborliness and protection of security in the Persian Gulf region.
 Rouhani made the remarks before leaving Tehran for Oman and Kuwait.
 
“The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought aggression against other countries, interference in their affairs and imposition of political and religious beliefs,” he explained. Rouhani also said Tehran welcomes a proposal submitted by Kuwait to resolve misunderstandings between Iran and those Arab states bordering the Persian Gulf, saying all differences can be settled through dialogue. The president also said that security should be provided by the regional countries without foreign interference.  He added, “The Islamic Republic of Iran seeks to expand relations with neighboring countries and boost stability and security in the region.” Some countries and media outlets have tried to link the differences between Shiite Iran and certain Sunni Arab countries over the crises in Syria and Yemen to religious differences.
 
Rouhani said division between Shia and Sunni, Iranophobia and Islamophobia are caused by the foreigners, he said. Elsewhere, the president said Iran has always had good relations with Oman and Kuwait. There are many capacities in the three countries to expand ties, he added.
