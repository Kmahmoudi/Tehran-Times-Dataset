TEHRAN – An aide to President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that the U.S. would have to return to the internationally-backed nuclear deal and stop new sanctions against Iran if it wants negotiations with Tehran.
 The remarks by Hamid Aboutalebi came in response to U.S. President Donald Trump who said on Monday that he would be ready to meet with the Iranian president "anytime" with no preconditions. "Respecting the Iranian nation's rights, reducing hostilities and returning to the nuclear deal are steps that can be taken to pave the bumpy road of talks between Iran and America," Aboutalebi tweeted, Press TV reported.
