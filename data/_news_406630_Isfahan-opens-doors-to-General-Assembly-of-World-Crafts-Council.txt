Back in 2015, the executives of the World Crafts Council picked Isfahan and Tabriz as world cities of handicrafts and carpets, respectively. Founded in 1964, the WCC is a non-profit, non-governmental organization, which aims at strengthening protective measures for craftspeople and getting their products into fresh markets. It also emphasizes the need to maintain inherited traditions yet setting eyes on subtle use of modern technologies.
