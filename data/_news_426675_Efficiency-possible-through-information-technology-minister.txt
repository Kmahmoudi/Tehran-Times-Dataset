TEHRAN – Efficiency, the only solution to benefit from limited resources worldwide, is possible through information technology, communication and information technology minister said, the ministry’s website announced. Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi made the remarks during his recent trip to the southern province of Bushehr on Saturday.  For instance, smart irrigation decreases water consumption and the smart water meters measure the consumption more precise, he added. IT-based services is the only field in the world in which, the job creation is developed, he said. There is no way other than moving toward IT since the digital transformation or fourth industrial revolution is happening all through the world, Azari Jahromi added. Iran’ telecommunication industry market share is 400 trillion rials (9.5 billion dollars) but there is no official statistics about IT market, he announced. According to Iran Chamber of Commerce Iran has 200 million dollars annual income from software export, he announced. The ministry plans to renovate data of IT ecosystem through agreements with other organizations, he said. He pointed to recent agreements signed between the ministry, agriculture ministry and energy ministry according to which, the data liberation is highlighted, he concluded. Data liberation is the practice of allowing users to view and export the data that you have about them. In theory, data liberation could be adopted as a legal principle but regulations in this area remain sparse. Data liberation reduces vendor lock-in.
