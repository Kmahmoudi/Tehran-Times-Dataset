On the agenda is an array of issues, primarily the presence of U.S. military forces on Iraqi soil. Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has told reporters he is approaching dialogue with Washington as a chance to push for the withdrawal of American troops.  Kata'ib Hezbollah, another Iraqi anti-terror group, dismissed the upcoming Iraq-U.S. talks, which are scheduled for next week, as “futile and worthless.” Meanwhile, Senior cleric and political leader Ammar al-Hakim also said Iraq's sovereignty will be complete once American occupation forces fully withdraw, underscoring that the United States should not have a permanent military base in the Arab country.
