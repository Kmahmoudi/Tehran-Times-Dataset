TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani is scheduled to leave Tehran for India on Thursday morning for a three-day trip, the presidential communications director Parviz Esmaeili said on Wednesday. Esmaeili said Rouhani’s visit is in response to the historic visit by Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi to Tehran back in May 2016. Meeting with Muslim scholars in Hyderabad, the capital of southern India’s Telangana state, as well as paying a visit to cultural and religious centers, and meeting with Iranian expatriates are among the president’s plans while in Hyderabad.
