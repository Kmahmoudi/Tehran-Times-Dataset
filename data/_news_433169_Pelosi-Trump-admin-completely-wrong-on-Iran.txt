TEHRAN – U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has described the Trump administration’s approach toward Iran, including its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, as “completely wrong”. Pelosi made the remarks in an interview with MSNBC at the Munich Security Conference, which was broadcasted on Monday. Discussing Vice President Mike Pence’s calls for European allies to follow the Trump administration’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal, she said, “The vice president is an articulate spokesperson for his point of view, which I think on the subject of Iran is completely wrong. And he did not get much response to it here I’m happy to say.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
