TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif made a tweet in Arabic language stating that “al-Quds (Jerusalem) will remain Arabic and Islamic”.
 The statement by Zarif came immediately after Donald Trump declared that the United States recognizes al-Quds the as capital of Israel and announced plans to relocate the U.S. embassy there. "I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel," Trump said from White House's Diplomatic Reception Room. The Iranian Foreign Ministry also issued a statement strongly condemning the decision by Trump, saying it is an “open violation of international resolutions”. Israel occupied al-Quds in 1967. The UN Security Council has approved resolutions demanding Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories.
