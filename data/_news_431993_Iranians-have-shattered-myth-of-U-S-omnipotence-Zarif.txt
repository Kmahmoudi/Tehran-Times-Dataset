TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said the Iranian people have shattered the myth of the U.S. omnipotence.
 “Iranians forced the US client to leave 40 years ago today. 3 years ago today, JCPOA entered into force, ending yrs of securitization of Iran. In spite of US machinations v. Iran for the past 40 years— & its withdrawal from JCPOA— Iranians have shattered the myth of US omnipotence,” he tweeted on Wednesday. By “the US client”, Zarif was referring to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the former U.S.-backed Shah of Iran who fled the country on Jan. 16, 1979, a few weeks before the victory of the Islamic Revolution. The 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, went into force on January 16, 2016. Also in a tweet on Wednesday, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Seyyed Abbas Araqchi said, “Today is the 3rd anniversary of the implementation of Iran nuclear deal which displayed how untrustworthy and unreliable the US is. A president sign, the next withdraw! Thank you President Trump for exhibiting this. Shame!” Trump withdrew Washington from the JCPOA in May 2018 and ordered sanctions against Iran. This happened despite warning by the international community including U.S. allies. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
