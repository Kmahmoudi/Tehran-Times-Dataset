TEHRAN – Iran's ambassador to Caracas said on Friday that the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia tried but failed to disintegrate Syria and Iraq. Mostafa Alaei made the remarks in a meeting with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, IRNA reported. Alaei said the Saudis are angry and have become more aggressive toward Iran and the resistance forces because their plots have been foiled. Arreaza, for his part, said, “Venezuela is trying various ways including consultations with governments to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
