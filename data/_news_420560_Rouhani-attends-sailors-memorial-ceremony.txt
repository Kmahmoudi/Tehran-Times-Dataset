TEHRAN – On Sunday, President Hassan Rouhani attended a memorial ceremony for crew members of an Iranian tanker who lost their lives when the ship burned and sank. The ceremony, held in Shaheed Motahhari High School, was attended by other top officials, including Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri, Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli and IRGC Chief Mohammad Ali Jafari. The Panama-registered Iranian tanker, which was carrying 16,000 tons of gas condensate, collided with a Hong Kong-registered freighter in East China Sea on January 7. The tanker sank a week after the incident, and all the crew members died despite all efforts to save their lives.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
