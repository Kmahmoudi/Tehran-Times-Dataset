TEHRAN - Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, an advisor to Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, has said that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the prolongation of the Yemeni political talks in Kuwait. “Saudis’ incessant military actions in bombarding the residential areas and infrastructure in Yemen and violating ceasefire have made the Yemeni political talks ineffective,” he said in an interview with ISNA published on Wednesday. He also said that Iran has not interfered in Yemen’s affairs, but it will continue to provide the Yemeni people with “humanitarian and spiritual supports”. Iran has sent humanitarian aid to the Yemenis with coordination of international bodies in spite of the obstacles created by the Saudis, the diplomat added. Amir-Abdollahian said, “Saudi Arabia is playing with fire by adopting wrong policy of war mongering in the region and is the main reason for regional crises.” The region will be harmed if Saudi Arabia does not revise its “wrong policies”, said Amir-Abdollahian who acted as the deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs until last month.
