TEHRAN – Some 5,000 clunker trucks, aged over 40 years, move across the city of Tehran during the night to collect wastes, Tehran Governor Isa Farhadi has announced. The renovation of the garbage collection fleet requires high amount of budget; this is while the Municipality of Tehran cannot afford the cost and the issue needs urgent measures, he stated. He went on to say that the vehicles are extremely old resulting in huge amount of emission and contributing to air pollution. “We tried to replace the clunker trucks with new ones, however, there is a large number of trucks that replacing the whole fleet is not nearly possible for Tehran traffic and transport affairs directorate,” he added. Clunker garbage trucks aged 40 years or above which travel through the capital at night amounts to 5,000, he concluded. There are two main types of air pollution sources, mobile sources including cars, buses, planes, trucks, and trains, and stationary sources such as oil refineries, industrial facilities, and factories. According to health and environmental officials over 70 percent of pollutants in Tehran is produced by clunker vehicles, which are 25 times more polluting than ordinary cars.
