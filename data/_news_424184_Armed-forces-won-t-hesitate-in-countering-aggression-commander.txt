TEHRAN – Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Hossein Baqeri on Saturday lauded Iran’s military power, saying the country’s armed forces “will not hesitate for a moment” in responding to any threat or aggression by the enemies, IRNA reported. In a message on the eve of the death anniversary of Imam Khomeini, General Baqeri said the Iranian nation’s “brave children” serving in the Army, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), police, and Basij use all their competence to defend “the independence, territorial integrity and national security of the Islamic Republic.”  Under the leadership of Ayatollah Khamenei, he said, Iran has overcome various challenges, threats and dangers created by the U.S. and the “evil triangle” of Britain, the Zionist regime and Arab reactionary ideologies. He also referred to the recent developments in Palestine, condemning the U.S. decision to transfer its embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds and the Zionist regime’s massacre of Palestinians who were protesting the embassy relocation. General Baqeri underlined the necessity for massive participation of people in the International Quds Day rallies on June 8. A widespread presence in the rallies will show people’s support for the “al-Quds cause” and the “Palestinian Intifada” and this can thwart the new U.S.-Zionist plot and accelerate the victory of the oppressed Palestinians, he said.
