This umbrella term covers conditions such as autism and Asperger syndrome. These disorders are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities. World Health Organization estimates that 1 in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder worldwide. Based on the Statista website, Japan was estimated to have the highest rate of autism worldwide with approximately 161 children per 10,000 with the disorder in 2017. The United Kingdom and Sweden come at the two second places for the high prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among children. The center receives no funds from the government, Davatgaran said, adding that so, some of the departments has been delegated to the faculty members of the universities with the help of the judiciary. “Patients under the Welfare Organization’s coverage receive free rehabilitation services, and those struggling financially can also receive services free of charge,” he stated.
