TEHRAN – The European countries should explicitly confirm Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement in the face of U.S. adverse policies, Russian ambassador to Tehran said in an interview with IRNA published on Friday. Levan Dzhagaryan said Russia and China’s opposition to the U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric on the historic 2015 nuclear deal – also known as the JCPOA – is “clear and obvious”. It is now Europe’s turn to voice strong support for the JCPOA, he added. MH/PA
