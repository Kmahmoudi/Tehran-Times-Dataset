TEHRAN- Syria has condemned a recent UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution against Iran, saying it constitutes an attempt by West to subvert international institutions in order to advance their own political objectives. The statement was made on Monday during a phone conversation between Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian and his Syrian counterpart Faisal al-Mekdad. “Syria affirms that such arbitrary, unacceptable decisions reflect a continuous method taken by Western states against independent countries in order to implement their destructive agendas in developing countries,” the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported, citing the contents of the Syrian top diplomat's conversation with Amir Abdollahian. The discussion was held less than a week after the UNHRC met in Geneva at the request of Germany and Iceland to talk about alleged human rights abuses in Iran amid the recent uprisings backed by the West. The intergovernmental organization decided to launch an global fact-finding investigation to probe into the alleged violations. The resolution, according to the Syrian foreign minister, was adopted as a result of intense pressure from the West placed on a number of the council's members, and it directly violates the sovereignty and the right of nations that adopt policies in consistent with their culture and history. On Monday, the Iranian foreign ministry summoned Hans-Udo Muzel, the German ambassador to Tehran, to express the Islamic Republic’s vehement disapproval of the "interventionist and false assertions" made by German authorities. Iran also criticized the resolution's adoption by the UN Human Rights Council as a bad decision based on a wholly instrumental and political view of human rights. The spokesperson stated the same thing on Monday, asserting that Tehran has already established a national fact-finding committee to look into the events and will not cooperate with the so-called fact-finding mission established in response to the adoption of the UNHRC resolution to look into claims of human rights abuses during the recent riots. Kanaani highlighted that Iran has established a national committee made up of specialists, attorneys, and official and non-official representatives to carry out its national tasks and conduct in-depth investigations as part of its obligations under international law. In addition, he denounced the rapid application of human rights mechanisms and their instrumental use against sovereign states, stressing that such course of action will not develop human rights. “Polish FM hopes sanctions-reduction talks would yield results” In yet another phone call between Iranian and Polish foreign ministers, Zbigniew Rau referred to Iran as one of Poland's most important partners in West Asia and expressed optimism for the success of the nuclear talks to lift sanctions against Iran. The two senior diplomats spoke about the positive relations between Tehran and Warsaw, according to Amir Abdollahian.  Both parties also discussed current foreign events, the Iranian foreign ministry said. Negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal –JCPOA- started in April 2021. However, the talks have stalemated as the U.S. is not showing seriousness to put the JCPOA on the right track. The U.S., under Donald Trump, quit the JCPOA in May 2018, returned sanctions lifted under the agreement and imposed new ones. Trump’s administration took such a strategy under his “maximum pressure” campaign against the Islamic Republic.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
