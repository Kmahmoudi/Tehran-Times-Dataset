TEHRAN – Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami on Wednesday said the hegemons are trying to contain Iran’s growing defense capability and restrict its influence in the region after they failed to confront the Islamic Republic militarily. Speaking at a meeting of Army commanders in Tehran, Hatami said the enemy used to say all options are on the table, but today it cannot do anything in practice. “This is while its animosity towards the Islamic Republic of Iran has increased,” he said. He also said regional nations realize that Iran has always wanted peace and stability for the region and the world.
