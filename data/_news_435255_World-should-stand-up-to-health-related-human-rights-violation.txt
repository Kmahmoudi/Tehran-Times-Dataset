TEHRAN — The Iranian health minister has called on health policy makers to fully stand up to those who violate health-related human rights by imposing brutal sanctions on countries.
 Saeed Namaki made the remarks during the opening ceremony of 7th World Health Summit Regional Meeting in the Persian Gulf island of Kish on Monday, ISNA news agency reported. No one should be deprived of their healthcare rights due to sanctions, no healthcare center in Yemen, Libya, or Republic of the Congo should be raided and no healthcare provider should be murdered like Dr Richard Mouzoko. Dr Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, an epidemiologist deployed by WHO in the response to the Ebola outbreak in DRC, was killed in an attack on Butembo University Hospital on Friday, 19 April 2019. Minister Namaki went on to explain that the importance of the Summit is being held at the time of unfair sanctions imposed by the U.S on Iran. While the U.S is striving to close all doors to Iran, thankfully scientists and academics who are fond of development of world health system travelled to Iran from around the world, he highlighted. He went on to say that politics can directly affect health systems worldwide, as regional conflicts have created instability in countries like Libya and Yemen, or when countries like Sri Lanka and New Zealand are subjected to violate terrorist attacks, and while one-sided, brutal sanctions have restricted countries access to vaccines, treatment services and medications. Elsewhere in his remarks, commenting on Iran’s rank in medical research worldwide and in the region the minister explained that using the potential of science and technology parks as well as incubator centers have resulted in increased number of medical researches and clinical trials.
