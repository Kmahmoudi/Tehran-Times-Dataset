TEHRAN- Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan announced on Monday that the Islamic Republic will continue its talks with Airbus and Boeing during the current week, ILNA reported. Referring to the recently published news [that the Republican-controlled House voted 243-174 to pass the legislation to prohibit the Treasury Department from issuing the licenses U.S. banks would need to complete the transactions that Iran has received no official statements], Fakhrieh Kashan said that Iran has received no official statement from the two giant plane-makers about the issue yet. He added that Iran will receive five of its ordered planes including one Airbus A321 by the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017), while no talks have been held to identify possible ways for Iran to make the payments for the airplanes. Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, Britain, Russia, China, France as well as Germany --started implementation of the deal, dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), on January 16. Under the JCPOA, all sanctions imposed on Iran by the European Union, the UN Security Council and the U.S. have to be lifted as Iran limits some aspects of its peaceful nuclear program. The White House announced last week on Monday that President Barack Obama will veto the bill seeking to block the export of passenger aircraft to Iran, saying it would undermine an international nuclear deal implemented early this year. The White House said American allies would view the legislation as a violation of the nuclear agreement. It seems the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the U.S. has allowed Republicans to take a more aggressive stance against Iran. Trump said during his election campaign that he would “dismantle”, “tear up” or try to renegotiate the terms of the nuclear deal if elected president. Iranian officials have warned the U.S. against walking away from the nuclear agreement, stressing that any U.S. president is bound to honor the deal as it has been endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution, which makes it effectively an international law.
