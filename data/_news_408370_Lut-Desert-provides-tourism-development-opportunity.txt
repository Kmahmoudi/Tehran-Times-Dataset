TEHRAN – The Lut Desert, one of the two deserts dominating the landscape of eastern Iran, has got what it takes to lure travelers considering its geological uniqueness. Inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List, the scorching Lut, is a mix of sand and salt. Its calming silence is also amazingly attractive. “The Lut Desert provides a suitable prospect for the expansion of tourism industry in the country,” Zahra Ahmadipour, the newly-appointed director of Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization said on Monday. She made the remarks during her visit to Jiroft in the southeastern province of Kerman, ILNA reported. Ahmadipour who doubles as vice president accompanied First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri and several other members of the cabinet during the visit to Kerman. The massive deserts, rich in magnificent scenery and unparalleled serenity, have much to offer their visitors who are in search of new adventures. Seven years of satellite temperature data analyzed by NASA show that the Lut Desert is the hottest spot on Earth. Based on the research, it was hottest during 5 of the 7 years, and had the highest temperature overall: 70.7°C in 2005.
