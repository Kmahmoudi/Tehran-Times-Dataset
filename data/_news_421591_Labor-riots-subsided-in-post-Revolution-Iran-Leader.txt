TEHRAN – The Leader has said that thanks to their insight, will, and religiosity, workers in the Islamic Republic have stood up against enemies’ attempts to use them against the country. “Anti-revolutionaries have failed to agitate workers against the Islamic Republic,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said during a meeting with executive staff of a conference on labor martyrs which took place on February 5, but its report surfaced on Monday. Enemies used to agitate workers to shut factories down, he said of the pre-Revolution days. The Leader also underlined the sacrifices of the workers who rushed to the war fronts during the Iraqi war against Iran in the 1980s to defend the country.
