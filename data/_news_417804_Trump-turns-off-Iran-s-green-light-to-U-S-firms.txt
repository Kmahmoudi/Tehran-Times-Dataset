Adopting a harsh new approach last week, Trump struck a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  In defiance of other world powers, he decided not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal. The act aroused a chorus of criticisms among affiliated European leaders who unanimously stated commitment to the complete implementation of JCPOA, confirming Iran’s compliance to the deal. Iranian officials were also angered by the U.S. president’s move warning him of reciprocal measures. The American President’s decision about JCPOA, however, has had minor impact on European’s economic attitude towards Iran. No matter what Trump’s attitude towards Iran is, Europeans are determined to pave their way to do business with Iran. For instance, French businesses will meet Iranian foreign and finance ministry officials this week to get better acquainted with the possible consequences of Trump’s decertification of Iran nuclear deal on doing business with Tehran, Reuters reports.
 
While Europeans do not seem to step back, it is worth noting that according to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Trump administration isn’t seeking to disrupt European business deals with Iran, Wall Street Journal reported.  In addition, as Iranian senior officials have repeatedly announced during the past few days, Iran’s gateways are open not only to Europeans but also to U.S. companies who want to benefit the country’s lucrative market.  
“We never told Americans to stay away from Iran’s market and doing business with us. It is the U.S. government who deprives them from doing trade with Iran,” Iranian First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri announced on Saturday addressing the 21st ceremony on the National Exports Day at the Tehran’s Summit Conference Hall. “We don’t have any restrictions for working or negotiating with American companies with the intention of developing the oil and gas resources of Iran. If they want, we are ready to negotiate with them tomorrow,” Reuters quoted Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh on Tuesday. He, elsewhere, scrutinized trump as the one who hinders Iranian-American economic relation. Therefore, while Europeans are in queue to tighten their business bonds with Iran, Trump’s aggressive approach towards Iran and its nuclear deal has not been in favor of American companies and has put them in exile, a long distance from Iran’s market. As a matter of fact, as of the implementation of JCPOA, Iran’s government has put economic diplomacy on top of its agenda. Iranian Foreign Ministry is on the process of changing its structure to support economic diplomacy. The ministry is adding economic department and deputy to boost Iran’s international economic bonds with the world.  The Iranian government has also taken some other major steps rolling out red carpet for foreign companies and investors who will assist Iran on its way to a booming economy. Apart from the political challenges, Iran intends to expand it economic bonds with the globe including Americans.
