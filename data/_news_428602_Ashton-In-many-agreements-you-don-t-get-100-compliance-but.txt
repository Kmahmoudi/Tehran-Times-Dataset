TEHRAN – Former European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton has voiced concerns about the U.S. unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, and its consequences for other diplomatic talks and joint collaborations in the future. Ashton made the remarks in an interview with the Director-General of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Karin von Hippel published on Friday. She also pointed to Iran’s compliance with the deal, saying, “As far as I’m aware, the Iranians are 100% compliant with what they were asked to do, and that of itself is quite interesting because in many agreements you don’t get 100% compliance.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
