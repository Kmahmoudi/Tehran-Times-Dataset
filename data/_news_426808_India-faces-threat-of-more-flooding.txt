TEHRAN - In the wake of catastrophic flooding in southern Indian state of Kerala, a Britain-based charity organization has warned that more devastating floods will become the norm in India if immediate and strong measures are not taken to tackle the climate change. As efforts are being put by the government and local aid organizations to provide relief to people affected by floods in Kerala, Christian Aid's official and expert on climate change Kat Kramer said this was a wake-up call that more needs to be done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "Science tells us that India and South Asia can expect more flooding events like the ones we're seeing in Kerala, as global warming continues. In the Tropics we can expect more than a 10 per cent increase in precipitation for a degree Celsius increase in temperature," she said in a statement. The statement has reignited a debate over global warming and Indian government's lack of strategy to deal with the impending crisis. "It also shows how climate change is having a disproportionate impact on the world's poorest people, which is why we need to see greater support to help the most vulnerable cope with emergencies of this nature," Kramer said. The floods in Kerala, which have been described as the worst floods in a century, have claimed more than 400 lives and rendered thousands of people homeless, who are putting up in makeshift camps. Many countries and international aid organizations have come forward with help but Indian government has refused foreign aid.
