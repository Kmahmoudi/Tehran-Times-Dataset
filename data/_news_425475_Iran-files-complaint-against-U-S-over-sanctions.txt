TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Monday that Iran has filed a complaint at the International Court of Justice against the U.S. over re-imposition of unilateral sanctions.
 “Today Iran filed a complaint @CIJ_ICJ to hold U.S. accountable for its unlawful re-imposition of unilateral sanctions. Iran is committed to the rule of law in the face of U.S. contempt for diplomacy & legal obligations. It’s imperative to counter its habit of violating int’l law,” Zarif tweeted. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and said sanctions will be restored against Iran. According to the U.S. Treasury, the first stage of sanctions will be snapped back in August and the second stage in November. Trump has asked countries to cut their oil imports from Iran by November. Under the nuclear agreement approved by the UN Security Council, Iran is obliged to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of sanctions. The entire world, excluding despots in Saudi Arabia and the UAE along with extremists in Israel, has expressed an unequivocal support for the preservation of the nuclear agreement without the U.S. NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
