TEHRAN – Colonel Ali Seify, Iran’s military attaché in Azerbaijan, says Tehran’s missile program is merely based on deterrence doctrine, Trend news agency reported on Saturday. “Our military capabilities - including missile power - are merely defensive and deterrent. They do not make any threats to other countries,” he said. “Iran’s missile power serves creating stability in the region,” the attaché added. Iran unveiled and successfully test-launched its latest ballistic missile dubbed Khorramshahr on Friday.
