TEHRAN – The Iranian naval forces have detected a reconnaissance aircraft operated by the U.S. Navy over the Sea of Oman, forcing it to avoid the Iranian airspace after issuing a warning, the Navy said on Sunday afternoon. The Navy’s public relations department said that an EP-3E airplane of the U.S. Navy was about to intrude into Iran’s airspace over the Sea of Oman. The vigilant naval forces gave the plane a warning and blocked its unauthorized entry into the Iranian airspace, the Navy added. The aircraft heeded the warning, stayed away from the Iranian aerial border and returned to international routes.
