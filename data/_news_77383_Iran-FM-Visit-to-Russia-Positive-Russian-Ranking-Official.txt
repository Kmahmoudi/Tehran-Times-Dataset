Lukin said the legal ground to further promote Tehran-Moscow cooperation had been prepared after Iranian and Russian officials exchanged documents on mutual agreements concluded between the two countries during president Khatami's visit to Moscow in March 2001. He said Kharrazi's visit had put an end to U.S. efforts to torpedo Tehran-Moscow cooperation, but cautioned that Washington would still continue to put Russia under pressure to stop cooperating with the Islamic Republic. The Russian deputy Duma speaker further stressed that Tehran-Moscow cordial relations would never jeopardize the interests of a third country. The Iranian foreign minister ended a two-day visit to Moscow on Friday during which he conferred with several ranking Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin on world developments and regional security and the legal regime of the Caspian Sea. Kharrazi had been scheduled to travel to Russia in February, but the trip was postponed due to coordination problems in his visit's agenda, IRNA reported.
