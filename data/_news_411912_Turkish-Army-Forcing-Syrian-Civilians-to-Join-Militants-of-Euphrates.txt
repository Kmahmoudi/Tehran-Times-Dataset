TEHRAN - Media source said that the Turkish Army troops are forcing Arab citizens in Northern Syria to join the Ankara-backed militants of the Euphrates Shield Operation, killing those who do not obey. Hawar news reported that the Turkish army killed four civilians in the villages of Kari Sabi town in Northern Syria after they refused to join the Euphrates Shield Operation forces. Hawar new went on to say that the Turkish soldiers further left the body of the killed Syrian civilians at the border region between Rojava and Bakour in Syria's Kurdistan. The news website added that the Turkish army intended to send the four killed civilians via border to Rojava but it faced tough opposition by the civilians. Media sources disclosed on Saturday that rifts were widening between militants of the Ankara-led Euphrates Shield Operation and the Turkish Army, causing tens of militants to give up fight and leave the operation. Hawar news quoted informed sources as saying that at least sixty Ankara-backed militants in al-Rai town in Northern Aleppo dropped ties with the Euphrates Shield Operation over low salary and Turkish Army's indifferences to the promises it made to assist the militants. Hawar news added that the Turkish army had promised to pay $400 to each militant as his monthly salary, but paid only 400 Turkish Lira to them. The news website went on to say that after differences emerged among the Euphrates Shield forces, 15 militants were kidnapped by the Turkish soldiers and transferred to an unknown location. Another source told Hawar news that the Ankara-backed militants were deeply worried about escalation of clashes with the Turkish soldiers, especially after the Syrian Army urged the Turkish army men to leave Syria's territories.
