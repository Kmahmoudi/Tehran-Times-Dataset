TEHRAN – The interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran has said clear vision was the real reason why the Iranian nation found precedence over the 2009 sedition. “The people who showed their clear vision on 9 Dey (December 29, 2009) should continue with their vision,” Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Movahedi said. This day is a day for renewing of pledge to the rule of jurisprudence, Movahedi Kermani said.
