TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called on people to turn out in large numbers in Quds Day rallies, predicting that Muslims across the world will mark the annual event with more unity this year.

 “We will witness more fervent participation of the Iranians and people from other Islamic countries in the ceremony of defending the oppressed Palestinians and liberation of Quds,” he said on the sidelines of a meeting with cabinet members on Wednesday. He went on to say that the Zionist regime of Israel has been trying to provoke clash among the Islamic countries in order to cover up its crimes against the Palestinian people. The Zionist regime’s crimes should not be ignored and the Palestinians should not get disappointed, he pointed out. “Our voice in Quds Day will be the voice of the Muslims’ unity and support for the displaced Palestinian people,” he noted. The president predicted that the Muslims will continue supporting the Palestinians and liberation of Al-Aqsa Mosque. Quds Day is an annual event held on the last Friday of Ramadan to express support for the Palestinians and oppose Zionism as well as Israel’s control of Jerusalem. A number of Iranian religious scholars, including Grand Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli, Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi and Grand Ayatollah Hosein Nuri-Hamedani, have called on the people to attend Quds Day rallies across the country.
