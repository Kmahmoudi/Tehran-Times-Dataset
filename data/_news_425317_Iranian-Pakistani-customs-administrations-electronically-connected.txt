TEHRAN- Electronic connection was established between the customs administrations of Iran and Pakistan, Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA) announced. Iran sent its first export cargo to Pakistan on Tuesday through Mirjaveh Customs Terminal in eastern country with e-TIR system, IRNA reported. E-TIR system allows the two countries to have access to all related information at any time, and view the information of the cargo before delivery which is useful for both sides and decreases the risk of deception, accelerates customs formalities and reduces the costs. The TIR system not only covers customs transit by road but a combination is possible with other modes of transport (rail, inland waterway, and even maritime transport), as long as at least one part of the total transport is made by road.
