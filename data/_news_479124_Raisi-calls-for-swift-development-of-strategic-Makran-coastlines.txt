TEHRAN- President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday called for a quick development of the south and southeastern shores of Iran, known as Makran in history books.  Raisi stated that plans for the development of the Makran coasts by the government and the private sector might assist the comparatively underdeveloped region.  The president made the remarks in Jask in the southern province of Hormozgan. Raisi visited the second marine area of Bandar Jask on the Sahand Destroyer, the commanding vessel, and reviewed the parade of the subsurface, surface, and flying units of the Army. Raisi made a tour of the Navy's facility at Jask to learn more about the subsurface, surface, and aerial capabilities of the military. The units participating in the parade were the Ghadir and Fateh submarines, the helicopter squadron, the Sahand and Alborz destroyers, the Fajr and Sirik frigates, the Tonb cruiser, the Hormuz-class landing craft, and the Ghadir and Sirik frigates. Before seeing the march on the deck of the Sahand destroyer, the president also stopped by a display of the Navy's accomplishments. The president was accompanied by the president's chief of staff, the minister of defense, the Army commander-in-chief, and the Navy commander. Raisi stated that the Makran coastlines have a great potential to turn into a crucial and economically critical zone for commerce, tourism, and industry. Makran is a historical region in Iran that runs from mountains west of Jask all the way to parts of Pakistan's Balochistan province in the southwest along the Sea of Oman. Iran has recently constructed significant nautical and commercial infrastructure in a number of Makran districts, particularly at Chabahr port, which serves as a vital trade route between the Indian Ocean and landlocked nations in Central Asia. Elsewhere in his remark, the president said the Navy's presence is highly comforting for guarding sea borders and supporting economic and commercial activity in international waterways. “Despite the threats that exist today in international waters and different parts of the oceans, the presence of the navy is reassuring for economic operators,” he emphasized, noting, “The expansion of economic activities and commercial development is possible with the presence of the naval forces of the Army.” Raisi stressed that the Iranian Army and Navy should be proud of their displays of might, originality, and inventiveness. Addressing the people in the city of Jask, the president indirectly referred to the recent unrest in the country, saying, “The great nation of Iran had been successful in preventing the enemies from achieving their goals and that this was not the first time that the enemies had plotted to destabilize the Islamic nation over the previous 43 years, including the eight-year imposed war on Iran and the imposition of economic sanctions, which could not avert the Iranians from achieving their goals.” Given the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei's speech on Saturday, the president stated that the Leader's remarks were sufficient to become better familiar with the stance of Basiji forces, who have done commendable work for the country. Raisi went on to add, “The Basiji troops have helped Iranians in a variety of situations, including earthquakes, floods, and the COVID-19 epidemic.” He also expressed appreciation to the Army and the other branches of the military for playing critical roles in preserving the Islamic homeland and demonstrating that they are astute guardians of the nation. The president also reviewed the difficulties of inhabitants of Jask, promising that he would request that the provincial governor to organize a special team to handle the people's problems. The importance of Makran's coastlines in the International North-South Transport Corridor has been stressed by the Leader and certain major military commanders.
