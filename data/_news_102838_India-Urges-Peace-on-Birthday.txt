In an address on Friday, Vajpayee said the traditional rivals should fight poverty instead of each other. Earlier, nine Pakistani members of parliament crossed the border at Wagah - the only official crossing-point - to take part in a candlelit peace vigil with Indian counterparts. Pakistan celebrated its own independence day on Thursday. Last year's celebrations were overshadowed by threats of a third Indian-Pakistani war over Kashmir, following an attack on the Indian parliament. However, relations have improved in recent months, with ambassadors exchanged and a cross-border bus service resumed. "On the occasion of our independence day anniversaries, I invite Pakistan to join us on the road for peace," Vajpayee said in Delhi. "We have been fighting for 50 years, how much more blood shall we spill?" Good-Natured On Thursday Pakistan marked its own independence day with renewed calls for dialogue with India to settle the dispute over Kashmir. Any improvement in relations with India hinged on that issue, Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali said. The BBC's Paul Anderson in Islamabad says the celebrations were good-natured, with plenty of flag-waving and street-partying. Troops at the border exchanged sweets. But there were posters accusing Pakistan's bigger neighbor of brutalizing and torturing the people of Kashmir. "India Get Out" read many banners, but the prime minister brought a note of moderation, even hope to the event. He said Pakistan wanted friendly relations with India but that that could not happen until what he called the oppressed people of Kashmir get their rights - first among them the right to self-determination. A general strike is being observed in Indian-administered Kashmir to mark Independence Day. However, thousands of people turned up for the main government function in the capital, Srinagar, in defiance of the militants' call for a boycott. However, there was a fresh upsurge of violence in India's troubled northeastern provinces in the run-up to independence day. On Thursday about 40 civilians and rebels were killed, as separatist groups in the region sought to enforce their call for a boycott of the celebrations. Pakistan and India won independence from Britain at midnight on 14 August 1947. Pakistan celebrates the event on the 14th and India on the 15th.
