TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Wednesday slammed U.S. President Donald Trump for his hostility toward the Iranian nation, saying U.S. hawks’ dream of “uprooting the Iranian nation” will never be realized. “A nation IS its people, @realdonaldtrump. Repeatedly calling Iran a "terrorist nation” reveals hostility toward an entire people & exposes the real reason for targeting them with your illegal sanctions. But US hawks’ dream of 'uprooting the Iranian nation’ will never be realized,” Zarif tweeted.
