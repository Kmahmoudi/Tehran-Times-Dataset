TEHRAN – Guardian Council chief Ayatollah Ahmad Janati on Saturday lauded people’s participation in pro-Islamic Republic marches, saying the nation foiled the enemy’s plots against the country. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across the country on Saturday to commemorate the anniversary of the mass rallies that put an end to the 2009 post-election unrest. The rallies have become known as “Dey 9”. Janati said Dey 9 (December 30) should be remembered as Bahman 22 (February 11), which marks the victory of the Islamic Revolution back in 1979. The senior cleric also said the Israelis and Western countries were disappointed when the post-election unrest ended.
