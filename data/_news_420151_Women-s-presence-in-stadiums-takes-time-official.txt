TEHRAN – Presence of women in stadiums takes time as it requires providing infrastructure and promoting culture, said deputy sports and youth minister for women’s affairs. It should occur in an atmosphere which secures both dignity and self-esteem of women, Mehr quoted Fariba Mohammadian as saying. The current situation of women's presence in stadiums does not consider the dignity of women, the Ministry of Sports and Youth is providing the best facilities for better utilizing cultural and sports areas.

Speaking about the presence of some women in manly looks, Mohammadian explained that we are duty bound to obey the regulations and it will be accomplished in a period of time. Currently, women and families are allowed to watch many sport fields such as volleyball, but women's presence in stadiums to watch soccer matches requires providing special situations, she concluded.
