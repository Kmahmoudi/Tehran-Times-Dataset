TEHRAN- The secretary of Iranâ€™s Association of Petrochemical Industry Corporations (APIC) announced that from the beginning of the present Iranian calendar year (March 21, 2018) up to now petrochemical companies could manage to inject $6.65 billion of their exports revenues to domestic economy, $6 of which was pumped into the Forex Management Integrated System, locally known as NIMA in a bid to address the country's foreign currency needs. As Mohammad Abhari told IRNA on Saturday, Iranian petrochemical companies are estimated to earn $12 billion of exports revenues in the current Iranian year 1397 (ending on March 20, 2019), of which $8.1 billion has been gain by the present times. NIMA, which seeks to boost transparency, create competitiveness among exchange shops and a secure environment for traders, is a new chance for importers to supply their required foreign currency without specific problems and for exporters to re-inject their earned foreign currency to domestic forex market. Secondary foreign exchange market was inaugurated in early July to allow exporters of non-oil commodities to sell their foreign currency earnings to importers of consumer products.
