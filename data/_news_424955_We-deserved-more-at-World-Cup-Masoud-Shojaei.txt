TEHRAN – Iran national football team captain Masoud Shojaei says they deserved a place in the 2018 World Cup Round of 16. Iran failed to qualify for the next stage with four points, one point behind Spain and Portugal. “As you see, we did our best and I think we deserved to advance to the second round.  The football world respect us for what we achieved in this tournament,” Shojaei said. “Team Melli made history in the competition, earning four points for the first time. We have been drawn in the Group of Death but snatched four points and it showed we participated in the competition with high-quality players,” the Iran captain added. Shojaei just played 68 minutes against Morocco and was an unused substitutes against Spain and Portugal. “Carlos Queiroz fielded the best players and I respect his decision. I did my best in training but I am not responsible for picking lineup,” Shojaei said.
