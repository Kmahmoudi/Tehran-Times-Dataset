TEHRAN - The Pakistani and Russian militaries will conduct a joint military exercise, termed Friendship 2018, involving over 200 troops from both countries in Pakistan’s northern highlands from October 21 to November 4, the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced in a statement on Tuesday. “The drills will be held at the Pakistani training center for special forces in Cherat at an altitude above 1,400 meters as well as at the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) in Pabbi [a town in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province],” read the statement. “Troops from the two countries will exchange experience in combat training missions in highlands as well as in fighting against illegal armed gangs.” This marks the third iteration of the annually-held Friendship exercise between Pakistan and Russia. The first-ever joint military drill was held in the fall of 2016 at Cherat in Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa involving 200 military personnel from Pakistan and Russia. In 2017, the exercise took place in Russia’s North Caucasus Republic of Karachayevo-Cherkessia including a similar number of Pakistani and Russian troops. “The Russian Armed Forces will be represented by over 70 servicemen of a mountain motorized rifle brigade stationed in Karachay-Cherkess Republic, Southern Military District,’” the statement noted. The exact composition of the Pakistan Army contingent has not been announced. “The joint exercises are aimed at strengthening and developing military cooperation of the two countries,” the statement added. While Pakistan has come closer to China in recent years and Russia has signed ambitious defense deal with India, Islamabad's relations with Moscow continue to be strong, which is evident from these joint military exercises.
