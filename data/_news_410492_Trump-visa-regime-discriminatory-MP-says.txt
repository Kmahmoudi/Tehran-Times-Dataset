TEHRAN – Member of the parliamentary National Security and Foreign Policy Committee has branded the recent visa suspensions ordered by U.S. President Trump as “a return to the Middle Ages and an instance of racial, religious, and ethic discrimination.”   Comments by Hossein Naqavi Hosseini come in reaction to a recent order by Trump to tighten visa-vetting protocols for people from seven predominately Muslim countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The order temporarily suspends visas for applicants from the nations for a 30-day period, up for extension.   AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
