TEHRAN - Global charities with operations in India have been forced to sack staff after the Indian government froze their bank accounts, accusing them of receiving funds from overseas. Amnesty International and Greenpeace have accused the BJP-led government in India of launching a “smear campaign” against NGOs, activists and journalists critical of the government. Amnesty’s India office has seen crackdown by the country’s home ministry, forcing it to remove at least 70 employees. In a statement, the watchdog said the government authorities are “increasingly treating human rights organizations like criminal enterprises”, adding that the group was the “latest target of the government’s assault on civil society in the country”. Aakar Patel, executive director of Amnesty India, said it is an organisation committed to the rule of law. “Our operations in India have always conformed with our national regulations. The principles of transparency and accountability are at the heart of our work,” he said in a statement. Greenpeace India has also been targeted for investigation by authorities in recent weeks and could be forced to leave altogether. Activists say it is an extension of a wider campaign against human rights groups in India. More than 19,000 NGOs have been blocked from receiving funds from overseas for violations ranging from not filing the appropriate paperwork to engaging in “activities not conducive to the national interest” under the Narendra Modi led BJP government. The government claims to have reduced the total flow of foreign funds from £1.6bn in 2014 to £691m last year.
