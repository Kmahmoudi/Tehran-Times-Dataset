TEHRAN – Gareth Porter, investigative historian and journalist, has called U.S. national security advisor John Bolton “warmonger-in-chief” and said his “tricks” to bring new accusations against Iran over its nuclear program are getting nowhere.

 “Warmonger-in-chief Bolton never rests. His latest trick: trying to gin up a new #Iran crisis by claiming Iran has lied to international atomic watchdog IAEA. But it's fallen flat. Neither the IAEA nor the Europeans took his antics seriously,” Porter tweeted on Friday, referring to a recent Bloomberg report that says Bolton’s anti-Iran push is failing to gain traction.
