TEHRAN – Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Alaeddin Boroujerdi said on Monday that Iran’s embassy in London had warned of the possibility of an attack on the embassy before the Friday attack occurred. However, the British government paid lip service to repeated warnings of the embassy over the past few months to increase security measures for the Islamic Republic's missions, Boroujerdi said, Mehr reported. The British government must take full responsibility for the attack and fulfill its responsibilities, he added.
