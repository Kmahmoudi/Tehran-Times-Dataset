TEHRAN- Daily production of gas from Iran’s South Pars gas field (shared with Qatar in the Persian Gulf) will be increased by 84 million cubic meters (mcm) by the end of the first half of current Iranian calendar year (September 22), according to the managing director of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC). Mohammad Meshkinfam further said that the current calendar year (which ends on March 20, 2019) will be a year full of work and activity for Iranian oil industry and specially for POGC (which is in charge of developing South Pars), IRNA reported on Saturday. South Pars daily output from its 18 running phases is 570 mcm at present. Meshkinfam called on all those involved in developing the giant gas field to make their most efforts for completing the unfinished development phases of South Pars. In late January, the POGC managing director said that $69 billion has been already invested for development of South Pars and taking the infrastructural investment into account the figure reaches $72 billion. The giant gas field accounts for supplying 70 percent of the gas consumed inside the country, he further announced. South Pars is divided into 24 standard phases of development in the first stage. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment. Completing development phases of South Pars is among the Oil Ministry’s priorities outlined by President Hassan Rouhani in a decree in mid-September, 2017.
