TEHRAN - Iran will finalize the deal to buy 118 aircrafts from the French plane maker Airbus in the third Iranian calendar month of Khordad (May 21-June 20), said Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, the Iranian deputy transport and urban development minister for aviation affairs. The official claims that the prolongation of the process has been due to the magnitude of the contract, the Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday. Iran signed two agreements with Airbus on January 16, 2016 as a part of the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The agreements include a contract between Iran Air and Airbus for the acquisition of the full range of new Airbus airliners (73 widebodies and 45 single aisle) which includes pilot and maintenance training and support services to help the entry into service and efficient operations of these new aircraft. Asked about Boeing aircraft, Fakhrieh Kashan said: “There has been no negotiation with this company but they have said they will come to Iran for negotiations.” Iran is seeking to modernize as soon as possible its ageing passenger plane fleet, which has been badly hit by sanctions over the past few years, according to the country’s Transport and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi. The minister said Iran currently has just 150 operational planes out of a fleet of more than 250.
