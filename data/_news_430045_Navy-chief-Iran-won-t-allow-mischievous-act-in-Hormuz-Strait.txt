TEHRAN – The Iranian Navy commander has said no country will be allowed to commit mischievous acts in the “strategic” Strait of Hormuz. In an interview with IRNA published on Thursday, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi said, “It is a strategic strait, as some 17 million barrels of oil are exported from the region each day.” The admiral added, “Despite the U.S. sanctions, all the time Iran has been safeguarding the security of the Strait of Hormuz and will never allow anybody to create centers of insecurity and commit acts of mischief in the region.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
