TEHRAN – Iranian director Mehrdad Oskui’s “Starless Dreams” has received an honorable mention at the DokuFest, an international documentary and short film festival, which came to end on Saturday in Prizren, Kosovo. “As documentary film of rare delicacy, it explores the interior world of young imprisoned women in Iran with an indelible emotional precision and sensitivity to its subject,” the jurors for the Human Rights Dox category of the festival proclaimed.   Earlier in June, “Starless Dreams” earned a special mention at the 4th Kino w Trampkach [Cinema in Sneakers] Film Festival for Children and Youth that was held in Warsaw, Poland.  The documentary shows young women in an Iranian juvenile detention center reflecting on the crimes they have committed and the harsh circumstances that have shaped their lives. In addition, DokuFest screened a number of movies by Abbas Kiarostami, in a tribute to the recently-deceased Iranian auteur who achieved global recognition for Iranian cinema after the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
