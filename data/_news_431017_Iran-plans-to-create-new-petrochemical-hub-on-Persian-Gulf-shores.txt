TEHRAN – Iran plans to establish a new petrochemical complex in Hormozgan Province adjacent to Persian Gulf waters, IRNA reported quoting a petrochemical official. According to Behzad Mohammadi, the managing director of the National Petrochemical Company (NPC), the new petrochemical complex will be constructed in the Parsian Energy Intensive Industrial Special Economic Zone (PEISEZ). As the new petrochemical hub, PEISEZ is planned to be established by the oil ministry in collaboration with the ministry of industry, mine and trade. “Considering the existing technical infrastructure, such as proximity to the airport, the Persian Gulf, Assaluyeh region and feedstock resources, Parsian could be a new hub for the country’s petrochemical industry.” Mohammadi said. Accessing diverse liquid and gas feedstock is one of the main attractions of Iran’s petrochemical industry for investors, and it is safe to say that the industry is Iran’s most lucrative industry. PEISEZ with an area of 9,800 hectares is located 15 km west of Parsian City in Hormozgan Province. The site is also located 20 km from the Persian Gulf International Airport and 43 km from Pars Port. This region is one of the major development poles in the country, which allows for the establishment of various energy-intensive industries due to its economic, environmental and geographic position.
