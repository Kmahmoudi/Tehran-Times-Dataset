TEHRAN — “As we go on we realize the Leader was right about America’s disloyalty not only to Iran but to other countries,” Iran’s ICT minister said in an interview with Mehr published on Monday. The U.S. has always gone back on promises, Mahmoud Vaezi pointed out, saying, “The JCPOA is an international deal and it is our job to seek support from Russia, China and the EU with adroitness as America must be accountable to them too.” SP/PA
