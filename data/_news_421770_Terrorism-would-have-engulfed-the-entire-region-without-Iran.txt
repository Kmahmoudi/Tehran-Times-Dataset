TEHRAN – A top commander of Hashd Al-Sha'abi says without Iran, the plague of terrorism would have spread all the countries in the region. Speaking with IRNA on Sunday, Erfan Abdolhossein lauded Iran’s role in the fight against terrorism in Iraq and Syria, saying the presence of Iranian military advisors in Iraq and Syria led to the defeat of terrorist groups, especially Daesh (ISIL). He further said Iran keeps a “fatherly” eye on the region and its military advisors have, with all honesty, provided the Iraqi forces with intelligence about the terrorists.
