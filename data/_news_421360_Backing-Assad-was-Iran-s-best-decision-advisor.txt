TEHRAN – Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, has said that helping Bashar Assad’s government in Syria was the best decision that Iran could make to repel threats. In an interview with Mehr news agency published on Saturday, Amir Abdollahian said if Iran had not helped Syria and its allies, terrorists would have poured into Iran. He also said, “If the U.S. does not interfere and allows the political talks in Astana and Sochi to reach a conclusion, a political solution can be found and the refugees will return to their country.” MH/PA
