TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that today’s youth generation is more prepared than the earlier generation to repel enemy.
 During a meeting with a group of teenagers and youths in Tehran, the Leader described the sacred defense as “golden page” and “bright juncture” in history of Iran. Iran refers to resistance against Saddam Hussein’s war against Iran in the 1980s as sacred defense. The resistance against the invading Saddam Army started in 1980 and lasted until 1988. “The international power imposed the eight years’ war on the Iranian nation to destroy the Islamic Revolution. However, the youths’ altruism, faith, courage and insight resulted in ending war in favor of the nation and strengthening of the Islamic Revolution,” Ayatollah Khamenei noted. He added, “Promotion of the culture of the Islamic Revolution in the region and among the Muslims in early years [after the revolution] made the domineering powers worried and they decided to destroy the revolution at any cost. So, they encouraged Saddam, who was cruel and selfish, to start the war and attack Iran.” He noted that the U.S. and European countries, especially the UK, France, Germany, and the former Soviet Union provided money and arms to the former Iraqi dictator. The Leader said France sold most advanced fighter jets and helicopters to Saddam and Germany provided poisonous chemicals to him to be used against Iranian soldiers and civilians during the war. Elsewhere, Ayatollah Khamenei said that the sacred defense should be commemorated for the “country’s progress” and “national growth”. Addressing the youths, Ayatollah Khamenei said, “Future belongs to you”. NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
