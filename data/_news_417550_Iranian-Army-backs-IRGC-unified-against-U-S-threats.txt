TEHRAN – The Iranian Army on Thursday released a statement giving its strong support for the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) against the U.S. administration’s hawkish stances toward the IRGC. Hitting back at the Trump administration for its plan to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization, the Army said all Iranian Armed Forces are “unified” in defending the country and fighting against terrorism. Without the IRGC’s contribution in counter-terrorism efforts, the acts of terrorism would have engulfed much of the region, the statement added.
