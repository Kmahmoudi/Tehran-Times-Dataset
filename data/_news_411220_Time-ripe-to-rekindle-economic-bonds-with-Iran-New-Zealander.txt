TEHRAN- New Zealand Labor Party politician and member of the parliament for Dunedin North, David Scott Clark, called for revival of economic ties between his country and Iran, underlining the Asian countryâ€™s post-sanction era. As IRNA reported on Saturday, Clark, who is the opposition spokesperson for economic development, trade and growth, as well as the associate spokesperson for finance and health, lamented about the drop in Iran-New Zealand commerce ties during the past years and regarded the time ripe for renewal of such relations with the 80-million-people Islamic country. The New Zealander official, accompanying a trade delegation, paid a visit to Iran in 2016.
