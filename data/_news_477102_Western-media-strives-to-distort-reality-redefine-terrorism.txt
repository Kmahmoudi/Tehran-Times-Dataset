TEHRAN- Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi has severely chastised the Western media for seeking to present their audience with a skewed image of the facts of the world, stating that every effort must be done to prevent this from happening.
 Raisi made the comments at a meeting on Monday with the family of Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, a legendary Iranian figure in fight against terrorism. Soleimani was assassinated near Baghdad International Airport in January 2020 on instructions from then-U.S. President Donald Trump. He slammed the Islamic Republic's adversaries for attempting to manipulate reality through Western media. Raisi stated that the "global hegemonic system is trying to redefine the concept of terrorism and pass itself off as the hero of the war against terrorism today, which relies on its media empire." General Soleimani, according to Raisi, has become one of the "symbols of the Islamic establishment," which is why the adversaries harbor resentment for Iran's top counterterrorism commander. Raisi stressed that Iran will pursue the assassination of General Soleimani while calling for the prosecution of former U.S. president Trump during his September 21 address to the UN General Assembly in New York. In other parts of his Monday remarks, Raisi noted that he stressed the fact that European nations and the U.S. are currently attempting to cover up the anti-Iran terrorist organization Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO), which has the blood of more than 17,000 innocent Iranian people on its hands.  Raisi insisted on this point in his UN speech and meetings he had with foreign dignitaries as well as media persons during his trip to New York. The Iranian president said that the MKO has been delisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Europe and that they even support them. The MKO was previously designated as a "terrorist group" by the European Union, Canada, the United States, and Japan. However, the organization was removed from the list of terrorist organizations by the European Union in 2009 and by the U.S in 2012. Some members of the notorious MKO, who were in Camp Ashraf in Iraq, are now hosted by Albania, where they are allowed to launch a disinformation campaign against Iran. Kazem Gharibabadi, the Judiciary chief’s deputy for international affairs and secretary of the country’s High Council for Human Rights, forewarned Europe back in February that supporting the MKO will have consequences, just as it did with Daesh. The European Parliament was criticized by Gharibabadi for endorsing the MKO and called them "political opponents".
