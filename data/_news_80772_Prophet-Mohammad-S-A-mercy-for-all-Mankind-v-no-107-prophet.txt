His nobleness was born on 17th Rabi-ul-Awal, about 53 years before Hejrah (migration) 25th April, 571 A.D., in the city of Mecca in the Arabian peninsula (which is now Saudi Arabia). A few days before his birth, his father Abdullah died, and his grandfather Abdul Mutallib took charge of him. According to the prevailing custom, the child was entrusted to Bedouin foster-mother Halima with whom he stayed for few years in desert, then Halima returned him to his own mother Amina. After some time his mother and grandfather died and Mohammad (S.A) came under the guardianship of his uncle Abu-Talib, father of Imam Ali (A.S). At the age of ten, he accompanied his uncle to Syrian on a commercial trip, during which the enlightened Christian marks recognized in his features the prophetic signs and foretold a great fortune for him. By the time he was 25 Mohammad (S.A) had become well known in the city for his integrity and honesty. A rich lady Khadija (A.S) invited him for her commercial enterprises and charmed by his honest and righteous character, offered him her hand for their blessed union. She was the mother of all of prophet's children except Ibrahim who was born the * * originally a Byzantian lady from Egypt. From his childhood, the prophet (S.A) had differed from ordinary people, and spent most of his time in seclusion, sometimes on Mount (Cave Hira, mediating on the mysterious of creation. It was during one of his spiritual retreats on Mount (cave) Hira that he felt a great spiritual charge talking place within him: He was frothy years old when the first revelation of God descended upon him. In 609 A.D. angel Gabrial appeared before him and recited the well known verses of Alaq chapter: "Proclaim! In the name of god who created - created human out of a chromozome... "chapter: xcviv.1-2" Then began the divine mission of Holy Prophet (S.A). Mohammad (S.A) started his mission secretly, first preaching to his nearest ones. Ali (A.S) and Khadijah (A.S) were the first who responded to his call. The number of his followers increased gradually, but with his outright condemnation of idolatry and exploitation the oppositions also grew intenser and resulted in physical torture of the prophet (S.A) and his followers who were then forced to migrate to Abysinia (now called Ethiopia. N.E.Africa). The Quresh tribe imposed  social boycott on Mohammad (S.A) offered his all kinds of bribes, but he refused to back down. After a few years the boycott was lifted, but owing to hardship undergone, his wife Khadija and much uncle Abu Talib passed away in 619 A.D. the 10th years of his prophethood. Almighty God arranged due consolation by enabling his to pass through a wonderful spiritual experience known as Ascension (Meraj). He was taken to the highest Heaven and in a miraculous expansion by consciousness he saw all the prophets (S.A) angles and spiritual realities. He perceived the infinite perfection and power of Almighty God, and the state of imperfection in which the human society was lingering. He received the new impetus to continue his great mission. This great journey to the Spiritual World gave him renewed vigor but at the same time the hostilities of the Quresh reach its climax, and the prophet (S.A) was forced to migrate from Mecca to Medina in 622 A.D. It was the turning point in Islamic history from which starts the Islamic calendar of Hejirah. In Medina, Prophet Mohammad (S.A) reorganized the community and preached the Message of Salvation but the offensive rampages of war pitted a handful of Muslims against the tribe, several times greater in number, but Prophet Mohammad (S.A) and his followers finally overwhelmed the enemy forces. In the years of 10 A.H 1632 A.D Prophet Mohammad (S.A) went to Mecca and addressed thousands of his followers. In this historical address in Ghadir Khom Holy Prophet (S.A) nominated and introduced I Imam Ali (A.S) as his successor and declared: "Ali is the Master of those whose master I am." On his return to Medina the fell ill and a few works later when he breathed his last, he has the satisfaction of accomplishing the divine Mission he has been entrusted write by God. His Holy Mission lasted 23 years and when, at the age of 63, he died, the entire Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam. Faith in Prophet Mohammad (S) as the last and final prophet is a cardinal tenet by Islam. In fact, fundamental tenet by Islam is belief in all prophets of God. All Muslims firmly believe that God sent messengers to all countries for guiding all nations on the earth. The names of some of them have been mentioned in the holy Qoran, along with their entrusted missions. All prophets were divinely inspired and all had the some identical message for mankind with such variations and differences as the social conditions of the **** required. According to Islam; Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Soloman, David and Jesus were among 124,000 prophets. Some prophets left behind holy books, are revealed by god and all prophets conveyed the message and unfold the commandments of God. Prophet Mohammad (S) was the greatest of all prophet, and with him prophethood came to an end there will be no prophet after him. Prophet Mohammad (S) had the ****mery and compassion of prophet Jesus Christ (A.S) power and authority of prophet Moses (A.S) patience of prophet Noah (A.S) and the Majesty of prophet Abraham (A.S). The prophecies of the provisos prophets concerning prophet Mohammad (S) and the life he led under divine inspiration, the miracles bestowed upon him and his exemplary conduct, establish his status as the prophet of god beyond any doubt. That is why holy Qoran says: "Surely Allah and his angels send ***** the prophet who : call for (olivine) blessings as him and salute him with a (worthy) saluting" chapter 33: *** Furthermore in one of the fundamental beliefs of all Muslims in that Mohammad (S) in the last prophet and Islam the last and eternal religion. Anyone who denies it cannot be considered a Muslim. Holy Qoran declares the prophet Mohammad (S) to be Khatam-an-Nabi-een" i.e Seal of the prophets: "Mohammad (S) is not the father of any men of you but he is messenger of Allah, and the real of prophets..." no: 40 chapt 33 Out of scope to discuss each and everything in detail but it in necessary to pay attention to the followings: A mission of mercy did prophet Mohammad (S) **** to heal and not to kill? No doesn't that defending battles fought by Muslims were not to kill but to heal and resembled surgical operations as a necessary remedy to remove the concerns of a savage and barbareous life of world Arab Tribes. The total casualties on both sides in the war during the prophet's time and authentically recorded as not exceeding one thousand and odd numbers only. The prejudiced historians expounded on those battlers to excessive lengths for undermining the compassion & force of Islam forgetting that Muslims never initialed any offense and killed only when necessary to protect lives of their own tiny force against pagan armies. The whole divine approach of Islam necessitated the came and sympathy of a doctor to cure the ills by self-destructing patients in the disease ridden society by the time. The message casualties, including those of the Muslims, were an insignificant price for a great revolutionary upheaval which offered the noblest ideology now cherished by over more than tow billion Muslims. The mission of holy prophet Mohammad (S) was one of love mercy and tolerance not of war, force or arms, when the prophet triumphed over Mecca, the central point of opposition, he forgave his enemies and offered these security of their lives. That moment changed everything. Such gentlemen moved the hearts of the opposing leaders. Eventually, the compassionate face of Islam appealed to their souls***** of the former foes become friends. At long last having realized the folly of their heretic actions, the fanatic partisans by idolatry broke the idols they used to worship in their houses and embraced Islam. Holy Prophet Mohmmad (S) these taught and proved that Islam is not a religious by aggressiveness to capture power or a peace of loud but centralizes its forces to reform and groom high human qualities, to absorb people, rather than to repel them. That was the Divine approach which motivated the former poly theints to willingly submit to God and proclaim themselves on Muslims. Holy prophet Mohammad (S) was given popular recognition even while he was alive and living among people and not simply after his death in such away that mythology and fiction could be interwoven with facts. Islam prevailed from his single personality to billions. Even the mighty rulers of the Roman and Persian empires were unvital to embrace Islam and people were entering the hold of Islam in thousands. Islam is not the religion of sword but religion of peace and prophet's mission is mercy love and, happiness and he taught to heal, not to kill. His book is holy Qoran in which 113 times in 112 chapters and of 113 chapters stated " In the name of Allah the beneficent the merciful" Holy Prophet Mohammad: Holy Prophet Mohammad (S) not only was a great commander and soldier in a battle ground, but he also had a personality marked by piety, kindness magnanmity, spirituality, humanity and grace to an *** that could be expected only from a chosen messenger of God.

He took advantage by every opportunity to raise the intellectual and spiritual level of the *****. His holliness was land of simplicity and led an informal, austere life, his lodging, clothing and food were extremely simple. Throughout his life he lived in moderation. His way of walking was graceful with no show of arrogance. He was always first to great when he encountered people. It is speech was marked by soft sentences loaded with a world of meaning: Simple, informal and clear. His logic was in true with the natural impulse by men, and he appealed directing to minds and hearts. He hated dealing with people do so. His eyes piercing  and charming but talk by modesty and grace. Holy Prophet Mohammad (S) treated the followers of the other religious with respect, except when they intended as armed enemies. He expect must by his ties with the unfortunate, the weak and the poor and disapproved aristocratic practices. He had a great regard for orphans. A great prophet that he was his holliness detested exaggeration and flattery and discouraged the people to indulge in excusive praise of his personality. He used to forewarn his companies and followers: "I am servant of God: do not elevate me to a super human level as the followers of Christ did to him." He always had *****behavior under all situations and never lost his never even in the most crucial moments. He never became excited, either in the moment of Joy, or in times of misfortune he remind the same prophet that he always was either in hardship or in glory. He underwent numerous trials and tribulations, suffered the neverbreaking difficulties of exile and faced many armed aggression in the last days of his life, he held undisputed supermacy and wielded unlimited power but his noble ways never changed their ourse as he was guided by he divine in his approach to people. Prophet Mohammad (S.A.) **** the same compassionate Prophet whether in exile or in power as mighty man. Neither the power by the mighty, nor the wealth of the rich, nor the few of tyrants, neither the ignorance by the ***** nor the influence of the **** customs and age old conventions over whelmed him in any way whatsoever. He paid back evil with good. A Jewish woman used to throw rubbish an holy prophet (S.A.) head whenever ****he * through her alley, he never protested.

                  By the time he was 25 Mohammad (S.A) had become well known in the city for his integrity and honesty. A rich lady Khadija (A.S) invited him for her commercial enterprises and charmed by his honest and righteous character, offered him her hand for their blessed union. She was the mother of all of prophet's children except Ibrahim who was born the * * originally a Byzantian lady from Egypt. From his childhood, the prophet (S.A) had differed from ordinary people, and spent most of his time in seclusion, sometimes on Mount (Cave Hira, mediating on the mysterious of creation. It was during one of his spiritual retreats on Mount (cave) Hira that he felt a great spiritual charge talking place within him: He was frothy years old when the first revelation of God descended upon him. In 609 A.D. angel Gabrial appeared before him and recited the well known verses of Alaq chapter: "Proclaim! In the name of god who created - created human out of a chromozome... "chapter: xcviv.1-2" Then began the divine mission of Holy Prophet (S.A). Mohammad (S.A) started his mission secretly, first preaching to his nearest ones. Ali (A.S) and Khadijah (A.S) were the first who responded to his call. The number of his followers increased gradually, but with his outright condemnation of idolatry and exploitation the oppositions also grew intenser and resulted in physical torture of the prophet (S.A) and his followers who were then forced to migrate to Abysinia (now called Ethiopia. N.E.Africa). The Quresh tribe imposed  social boycott on Mohammad (S.A) offered his all kinds of bribes, but he refused to back down. After a few years the boycott was lifted, but owing to hardship undergone, his wife Khadija and much uncle Abu Talib passed away in 619 A.D. the 10th years of his prophethood. Almighty God arranged due consolation by enabling his to pass through a wonderful spiritual experience known as Ascension (Meraj). He was taken to the highest Heaven and in a miraculous expansion by consciousness he saw all the prophets (S.A) angles and spiritual realities. He perceived the infinite perfection and power of Almighty God, and the state of imperfection in which the human society was lingering. He received the new impetus to continue his great mission. This great journey to the Spiritual World gave him renewed vigor but at the same time the hostilities of the Quresh reach its climax, and the prophet (S.A) was forced to migrate from Mecca to Medina in 622 A.D. It was the turning point in Islamic history from which starts the Islamic calendar of Hejirah. In Medina, Prophet Mohammad (S.A) reorganized the community and preached the Message of Salvation but the offensive rampages of war pitted a handful of Muslims against the tribe, several times greater in number, but Prophet Mohammad (S.A) and his followers finally overwhelmed the enemy forces. In the years of 10 A.H 1632 A.D Prophet Mohammad (S.A) went to Mecca and addressed thousands of his followers. In this historical address in Ghadir Khom Holy Prophet (S.A) nominated and introduced I Imam Ali (A.S) as his successor and declared: "Ali is the Master of those whose master I am." On his return to Medina the fell ill and a few works later when he breathed his last, he has the satisfaction of accomplishing the divine Mission he has been entrusted write by God. His Holy Mission lasted 23 years and when, at the age of 63, he died, the entire Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam. Faith in Prophet Mohammad (S) as the last and final prophet is a cardinal tenet by Islam. In fact, fundamental tenet by Islam is belief in all prophets of God. All Muslims firmly believe that God sent messengers to all countries for guiding all nations on the earth. The names of some of them have been mentioned in the holy Qoran, along with their entrusted missions. All prophets were divinely inspired and all had the some identical message for mankind with such variations and differences as the social conditions of the **** required. According to Islam; Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Soloman, David and Jesus were among 124,000 prophets. Some prophets left behind holy books, are revealed by god and all prophets conveyed the message and unfold the commandments of God. Prophet Mohammad (S) was the greatest of all prophet, and with him prophethood came to an end there will be no prophet after him. Prophet Mohammad (S) had the ****mery and compassion of prophet Jesus Christ (A.S) power and authority of prophet Moses (A.S) patience of prophet Noah (A.S) and the Majesty of prophet Abraham (A.S). The prophecies of the provisos prophets concerning prophet Mohammad (S) and the life he led under divine inspiration, the miracles bestowed upon him and his exemplary conduct, establish his status as the prophet of god beyond any doubt. That is why holy Qoran says: "Surely Allah and his angels send ***** the prophet who : call for (olivine) blessings as him and salute him with a (worthy) saluting" chapter 33: *** Furthermore in one of the fundamental beliefs of all Muslims in that Mohammad (S) in the last prophet and Islam the last and eternal religion. Anyone who denies it cannot be considered a Muslim. Holy Qoran declares the prophet Mohammad (S) to be Khatam-an-Nabi-een" i.e Seal of the prophets: "Mohammad (S) is not the father of any men of you but he is messenger of Allah, and the real of prophets..." no: 40 chapt 33 Out of scope to discuss each and everything in detail but it in necessary to pay attention to the followings: A mission of mercy did prophet Mohammad (S) **** to heal and not to kill? No doesn't that defending battles fought by Muslims were not to kill but to heal and resembled surgical operations as a necessary remedy to remove the concerns of a savage and barbareous life of world Arab Tribes. The total casualties on both sides in the war during the prophet's time and authentically recorded as not exceeding one thousand and odd numbers only. The prejudiced historians expounded on those battlers to excessive lengths for undermining the compassion & force of Islam forgetting that Muslims never initialed any offense and killed only when necessary to protect lives of their own tiny force against pagan armies. The whole divine approach of Islam necessitated the came and sympathy of a doctor to cure the ills by self-destructing patients in the disease ridden society by the time. The message casualties, including those of the Muslims, were an insignificant price for a great revolutionary upheaval which offered the noblest ideology now cherished by over more than tow billion Muslims. The mission of holy prophet Mohammad (S) was one of love mercy and tolerance not of war, force or arms, when the prophet triumphed over Mecca, the central point of opposition, he forgave his enemies and offered these security of their lives. That moment changed everything. Such gentlemen moved the hearts of the opposing leaders. Eventually, the compassionate face of Islam appealed to their souls***** of the former foes become friends. At long last having realized the folly of their heretic actions, the fanatic partisans by idolatry broke the idols they used to worship in their houses and embraced Islam. Holy Prophet Mohmmad (S) these taught and proved that Islam is not a religious by aggressiveness to capture power or a peace of loud but centralizes its forces to reform and groom high human qualities, to absorb people, rather than to repel them. That was the Divine approach which motivated the former poly theints to willingly submit to God and proclaim themselves on Muslims. Holy prophet Mohammad (S) was given popular recognition even while he was alive and living among people and not simply after his death in such away that mythology and fiction could be interwoven with facts. Islam prevailed from his single personality to billions. Even the mighty rulers of the Roman and Persian empires were unvital to embrace Islam and people were entering the hold of Islam in thousands. Islam is not the religion of sword but religion of peace and prophet's mission is mercy love and, happiness and he taught to heal, not to kill. His book is holy Qoran in which 113 times in 112 chapters and of 113 chapters stated " In the name of Allah the beneficent the merciful" Holy Prophet Mohammad: Holy Prophet Mohammad (S) not only was a great commander and soldier in a battle ground, but he also had a personality marked by piety, kindness magnanmity, spirituality, humanity and grace to an *** that could be expected only from a chosen messenger of God.

                  N.E.Africa). The Quresh tribe imposed  social boycott on Mohammad (S.A) offered his all kinds of bribes, but he refused to back down. After a few years the boycott was lifted, but owing to hardship undergone, his wife Khadija and much uncle Abu Talib passed away in 619 A.D. the 10th years of his prophethood. Almighty God arranged due consolation by enabling his to pass through a wonderful spiritual experience known as Ascension (Meraj). He was taken to the highest Heaven and in a miraculous expansion by consciousness he saw all the prophets (S.A) angles and spiritual realities. He perceived the infinite perfection and power of Almighty God, and the state of imperfection in which the human society was lingering. He received the new impetus to continue his great mission. This great journey to the Spiritual World gave him renewed vigor but at the same time the hostilities of the Quresh reach its climax, and the prophet (S.A) was forced to migrate from Mecca to Medina in 622 A.D. It was the turning point in Islamic history from which starts the Islamic calendar of Hejirah. In Medina, Prophet Mohammad (S.A) reorganized the community and preached the Message of Salvation but the offensive rampages of war pitted a handful of Muslims against the tribe, several times greater in number, but Prophet Mohammad (S.A) and his followers finally overwhelmed the enemy forces. In the years of 10 A.H 1632 A.D Prophet Mohammad (S.A) went to Mecca and addressed thousands of his followers. In this historical address in Ghadir Khom Holy Prophet (S.A) nominated and introduced I Imam Ali (A.S) as his successor and declared: "Ali is the Master of those whose master I am." On his return to Medina the fell ill and a few works later when he breathed his last, he has the satisfaction of accomplishing the divine Mission he has been entrusted write by God. His Holy Mission lasted 23 years and when, at the age of 63, he died, the entire Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam. Faith in Prophet Mohammad (S) as the last and final prophet is a cardinal tenet by Islam. In fact, fundamental tenet by Islam is belief in all prophets of God. All Muslims firmly believe that God sent messengers to all countries for guiding all nations on the earth. The names of some of them have been mentioned in the holy Qoran, along with their entrusted missions. All prophets were divinely inspired and all had the some identical message for mankind with such variations and differences as the social conditions of the **** required. According to Islam; Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Soloman, David and Jesus were among 124,000 prophets. Some prophets left behind holy books, are revealed by god and all prophets conveyed the message and unfold the commandments of God. Prophet Mohammad (S) was the greatest of all prophet, and with him prophethood came to an end there will be no prophet after him. Prophet Mohammad (S) had the ****mery and compassion of prophet Jesus Christ (A.S) power and authority of prophet Moses (A.S) patience of prophet Noah (A.S) and the Majesty of prophet Abraham (A.S). The prophecies of the provisos prophets concerning prophet Mohammad (S) and the life he led under divine inspiration, the miracles bestowed upon him and his exemplary conduct, establish his status as the prophet of god beyond any doubt. That is why holy Qoran says: "Surely Allah and his angels send ***** the prophet who : call for (olivine) blessings as him and salute him with a (worthy) saluting" chapter 33: *** Furthermore in one of the fundamental beliefs of all Muslims in that Mohammad (S) in the last prophet and Islam the last and eternal religion. Anyone who denies it cannot be considered a Muslim.

The total casualties on both sides in the war during the prophet's time and authentically recorded as not exceeding one thousand and odd numbers only. The prejudiced historians expounded on those battlers to excessive lengths for undermining the compassion & force of Islam forgetting that Muslims never initialed any offense and killed only when necessary to protect lives of their own tiny force against pagan armies. The whole divine approach of Islam necessitated the came and sympathy of a doctor to cure the ills by self-destructing patients in the disease ridden society by the time. The message casualties, including those of the Muslims, were an insignificant price for a great revolutionary upheaval which offered the noblest ideology now cherished by over more than tow billion Muslims. The mission of holy prophet Mohammad (S) was one of love mercy and tolerance not of war, force or arms, when the prophet triumphed over Mecca, the central point of opposition, he forgave his enemies and offered these security of their lives.

At long last having realized the folly of their heretic actions, the fanatic partisans by idolatry broke the idols they used to worship in their houses and embraced Islam. Holy Prophet Mohmmad (S) these taught and proved that Islam is not a religious by aggressiveness to capture power or a peace of loud but centralizes its forces to reform and groom high human qualities, to absorb people, rather than to repel them. That was the Divine approach which motivated the former poly theints to willingly submit to God and proclaim themselves on Muslims.

                  It was the turning point in Islamic history from which starts the Islamic calendar of Hejirah. In Medina, Prophet Mohammad (S.A) reorganized the community and preached the Message of Salvation but the offensive rampages of war pitted a handful of Muslims against the tribe, several times greater in number, but Prophet Mohammad (S.A) and his followers finally overwhelmed the enemy forces. In the years of 10 A.H 1632 A.D Prophet Mohammad (S.A) went to Mecca and addressed thousands of his followers. In this historical address in Ghadir Khom Holy Prophet (S.A) nominated and introduced I Imam Ali (A.S) as his successor and declared: "Ali is the Master of those whose master I am." On his return to Medina the fell ill and a few works later when he breathed his last, he has the satisfaction of accomplishing the divine Mission he has been entrusted write by God. His Holy Mission lasted 23 years and when, at the age of 63, he died, the entire Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam. Faith in Prophet Mohammad (S) as the last and final prophet is a cardinal tenet by Islam. In fact, fundamental tenet by Islam is belief in all prophets of God. All Muslims firmly believe that God sent messengers to all countries for guiding all nations on the earth. The names of some of them have been mentioned in the holy Qoran, along with their entrusted missions. All prophets were divinely inspired and all had the some identical message for mankind with such variations and differences as the social conditions of the **** required. According to Islam; Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Soloman, David and Jesus were among 124,000 prophets. Some prophets left behind holy books, are revealed by god and all prophets conveyed the message and unfold the commandments of God. Prophet Mohammad (S) was the greatest of all prophet, and with him prophethood came to an end there will be no prophet after him. Prophet Mohammad (S) had the ****mery and compassion of prophet Jesus Christ (A.S) power and authority of prophet Moses (A.S) patience of prophet Noah (A.S) and the Majesty of prophet Abraham (A.S). The prophecies of the provisos prophets concerning prophet Mohammad (S) and the life he led under divine inspiration, the miracles bestowed upon him and his exemplary conduct, establish his status as the prophet of god beyond any doubt. That is why holy Qoran says: "Surely Allah and his angels send ***** the prophet who : call for (olivine) blessings as him and salute him with a (worthy) saluting" chapter 33: *** Furthermore in one of the fundamental beliefs of all Muslims in that Mohammad (S) in the last prophet and Islam the last and eternal religion. Anyone who denies it cannot be considered a Muslim. Holy Qoran declares the prophet Mohammad (S) to be Khatam-an-Nabi-een" i.e Seal of the prophets: "Mohammad (S) is not the father of any men of you but he is messenger of Allah, and the real of prophets..." no: 40 chapt 33 Out of scope to discuss each and everything in detail but it in necessary to pay attention to the followings: A mission of mercy did prophet Mohammad (S) **** to heal and not to kill? No doesn't that defending battles fought by Muslims were not to kill but to heal and resembled surgical operations as a necessary remedy to remove the concerns of a savage and barbareous life of world Arab Tribes. The total casualties on both sides in the war during the prophet's time and authentically recorded as not exceeding one thousand and odd numbers only. The prejudiced historians expounded on those battlers to excessive lengths for undermining the compassion & force of Islam forgetting that Muslims never initialed any offense and killed only when necessary to protect lives of their own tiny force against pagan armies. The whole divine approach of Islam necessitated the came and sympathy of a doctor to cure the ills by self-destructing patients in the disease ridden society by the time. The message casualties, including those of the Muslims, were an insignificant price for a great revolutionary upheaval which offered the noblest ideology now cherished by over more than tow billion Muslims. The mission of holy prophet Mohammad (S) was one of love mercy and tolerance not of war, force or arms, when the prophet triumphed over Mecca, the central point of opposition, he forgave his enemies and offered these security of their lives. That moment changed everything. Such gentlemen moved the hearts of the opposing leaders. Eventually, the compassionate face of Islam appealed to their souls***** of the former foes become friends. At long last having realized the folly of their heretic actions, the fanatic partisans by idolatry broke the idols they used to worship in their houses and embraced Islam. Holy Prophet Mohmmad (S) these taught and proved that Islam is not a religious by aggressiveness to capture power or a peace of loud but centralizes its forces to reform and groom high human qualities, to absorb people, rather than to repel them. That was the Divine approach which motivated the former poly theints to willingly submit to God and proclaim themselves on Muslims. Holy prophet Mohammad (S) was given popular recognition even while he was alive and living among people and not simply after his death in such away that mythology and fiction could be interwoven with facts. Islam prevailed from his single personality to billions. Even the mighty rulers of the Roman and Persian empires were unvital to embrace Islam and people were entering the hold of Islam in thousands. Islam is not the religion of sword but religion of peace and prophet's mission is mercy love and, happiness and he taught to heal, not to kill. His book is holy Qoran in which 113 times in 112 chapters and of 113 chapters stated " In the name of Allah the beneficent the merciful" Holy Prophet Mohammad: Holy Prophet Mohammad (S) not only was a great commander and soldier in a battle ground, but he also had a personality marked by piety, kindness magnanmity, spirituality, humanity and grace to an *** that could be expected only from a chosen messenger of God. His humbleness was not an outcome by any weakness while his power never *****in pride or injustice. He was always seen to visit the sick and console the unfortunate as long as he lived. He took advantage by every opportunity to raise the intellectual and spiritual level of the *****. His holliness was land of simplicity and led an informal, austere life, his lodging, clothing and food were extremely simple. Throughout his life he lived in moderation. His way of walking was graceful with no show of arrogance. He was always first to great when he encountered people. It is speech was marked by soft sentences loaded with a world of meaning: Simple, informal and clear. His logic was in true with the natural impulse by men, and he appealed directing to minds and hearts. He hated dealing with people do so. His eyes piercing  and charming but talk by modesty and grace. Holy Prophet Mohammad (S) treated the followers of the other religious with respect, except when they intended as armed enemies. He expect must by his ties with the unfortunate, the weak and the poor and disapproved aristocratic practices. He had a great regard for orphans. A great prophet that he was his holliness detested exaggeration and flattery and discouraged the people to indulge in excusive praise of his personality. He used to forewarn his companies and followers: "I am servant of God: do not elevate me to a super human level as the followers of Christ did to him." He always had *****behavior under all situations and never lost his never even in the most crucial moments. He never became excited, either in the moment of Joy, or in times of misfortune he remind the same prophet that he always was either in hardship or in glory. He underwent numerous trials and tribulations, suffered the neverbreaking difficulties of exile and faced many armed aggression in the last days of his life, he held undisputed supermacy and wielded unlimited power but his noble ways never changed their ourse as he was guided by he divine in his approach to people. Prophet Mohammad (S.A.) **** the same compassionate Prophet whether in exile or in power as mighty man. Neither the power by the mighty, nor the wealth of the rich, nor the few of tyrants, neither the ignorance by the ***** nor the influence of the **** customs and age old conventions over whelmed him in any way whatsoever.

                  In fact, fundamental tenet by Islam is belief in all prophets of God. All Muslims firmly believe that God sent messengers to all countries for guiding all nations on the earth. The names of some of them have been mentioned in the holy Qoran, along with their entrusted missions. All prophets were divinely inspired and all had the some identical message for mankind with such variations and differences as the social conditions of the **** required. According to Islam; Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Soloman, David and Jesus were among 124,000 prophets. Some prophets left behind holy books, are revealed by god and all prophets conveyed the message and unfold the commandments of God. Prophet Mohammad (S) was the greatest of all prophet, and with him prophethood came to an end there will be no prophet after him. Prophet Mohammad (S) had the ****mery and compassion of prophet Jesus Christ (A.S) power and authority of prophet Moses (A.S) patience of prophet Noah (A.S) and the Majesty of prophet Abraham (A.S). The prophecies of the provisos prophets concerning prophet Mohammad (S) and the life he led under divine inspiration, the miracles bestowed upon him and his exemplary conduct, establish his status as the prophet of god beyond any doubt. That is why holy Qoran says: "Surely Allah and his angels send ***** the prophet who : call for (olivine) blessings as him and salute him with a (worthy) saluting" chapter 33: *** Furthermore in one of the fundamental beliefs of all Muslims in that Mohammad (S) in the last prophet and Islam the last and eternal religion. Anyone who denies it cannot be considered a Muslim. Holy Qoran declares the prophet Mohammad (S) to be Khatam-an-Nabi-een" i.e Seal of the prophets: "Mohammad (S) is not the father of any men of you but he is messenger of Allah, and the real of prophets..." no: 40 chapt 33 Out of scope to discuss each and everything in detail but it in necessary to pay attention to the followings: A mission of mercy did prophet Mohammad (S) **** to heal and not to kill? No doesn't that defending battles fought by Muslims were not to kill but to heal and resembled surgical operations as a necessary remedy to remove the concerns of a savage and barbareous life of world Arab Tribes. The total casualties on both sides in the war during the prophet's time and authentically recorded as not exceeding one thousand and odd numbers only. The prejudiced historians expounded on those battlers to excessive lengths for undermining the compassion & force of Islam forgetting that Muslims never initialed any offense and killed only when necessary to protect lives of their own tiny force against pagan armies. The whole divine approach of Islam necessitated the came and sympathy of a doctor to cure the ills by self-destructing patients in the disease ridden society by the time. The message casualties, including those of the Muslims, were an insignificant price for a great revolutionary upheaval which offered the noblest ideology now cherished by over more than tow billion Muslims. The mission of holy prophet Mohammad (S) was one of love mercy and tolerance not of war, force or arms, when the prophet triumphed over Mecca, the central point of opposition, he forgave his enemies and offered these security of their lives. That moment changed everything. Such gentlemen moved the hearts of the opposing leaders. Eventually, the compassionate face of Islam appealed to their souls***** of the former foes become friends. At long last having realized the folly of their heretic actions, the fanatic partisans by idolatry broke the idols they used to worship in their houses and embraced Islam. Holy Prophet Mohmmad (S) these taught and proved that Islam is not a religious by aggressiveness to capture power or a peace of loud but centralizes its forces to reform and groom high human qualities, to absorb people, rather than to repel them. That was the Divine approach which motivated the former poly theints to willingly submit to God and proclaim themselves on Muslims. Holy prophet Mohammad (S) was given popular recognition even while he was alive and living among people and not simply after his death in such away that mythology and fiction could be interwoven with facts.

                  The prejudiced historians expounded on those battlers to excessive lengths for undermining the compassion & force of Islam forgetting that Muslims never initialed any offense and killed only when necessary to protect lives of their own tiny force against pagan armies. The whole divine approach of Islam necessitated the came and sympathy of a doctor to cure the ills by self-destructing patients in the disease ridden society by the time. The message casualties, including those of the Muslims, were an insignificant price for a great revolutionary upheaval which offered the noblest ideology now cherished by over more than tow billion Muslims.

That moment changed everything. Such gentlemen moved the hearts of the opposing leaders. Eventually, the compassionate face of Islam appealed to their souls***** of the former foes become friends. At long last having realized the folly of their heretic actions, the fanatic partisans by idolatry broke the idols they used to worship in their houses and embraced Islam. Holy Prophet Mohmmad (S) these taught and proved that Islam is not a religious by aggressiveness to capture power or a peace of loud but centralizes its forces to reform and groom high human qualities, to absorb people, rather than to repel them.
