TEHRAN – The number of foreign tourists to Qazvin province has significantly increased during the first six months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-September 22), compared to the same period last year, provincial tourism chief has said. “Statistics show that over 12,600 foreign nationals visited historical destinations across Qazvin province during the first six months of the year, which indicated a significant year-on-year increase,” Mohammad-Ali Hazrati said, ISNA reported. He didn’t mention how many foreign nationals visited Qazvin in the six-month period last year. Famed for carpets and seedless grapes, Qazvin embraces wonderfully restored caravanserais, monuments, mosques, bazaars, atmospheric areas, some quirky museums and a handful of decent eating options. Its capital of the same name, was once the capital of all Iran, but for most foreign travelers it is primarily the staging point for excursions to the famous Castles of the Assassins and trekking in the sensational Alamut Valley.
