According to Marjan-Mehr, so far over 200 trillion rials (about $4.7 million) of research studies have been awarded to the country’s universities in the current Iranian calendar year (started on March 20). He referred to another online event that is scheduled to be held on Tuesday and noted: “The research achievements of electricity companies will be presented in this event so that they can be indigenized by domestic industries.” According to the official 10 major companies from various provinces are going to present 35 innovative products in the mentioned event. “Nearly 100 university researchers have worked on these 35 technological products and most of them are based on the needs of the country’s power companies,” he added.
