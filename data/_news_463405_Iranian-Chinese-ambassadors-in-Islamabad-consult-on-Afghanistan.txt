Pakistan last month welcomed the Tehran peace summit with Afghan groups, including the Taliban, and the role of the Islamic Republic in brokering peace between the Afghan government and the Taliban Welcoming Iran’s engagement with Afghan groups to reach a political agreement through negotiations, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed hope that the Afghan groups would seize this opportunity to achieve a comprehensive political settlement. Iran hosted talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban on July 8 and 9. At the second day of the meeting, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif urged the two sides to put an end to the decades-long war in Afghanistan. Zarif advised the sides that “showing courage in peace is more important than showing courage in war.” “Showing courage in peace is more important than showing courage in war; because to achieve peace, one must sacrifice and forgive and ignore maximum demands and [instead] heed the demands of the other side, especially in these negotiations where ... both sides are brothers and in pursuit of peace and well-being of the Afghan nation,” Zarif told the final session of the talks. On the first day of the meeting on July 8, Zarif said Iran is happy to host talks between the representatives from the Afghan government and the Taliban, calling them Iran’s “brethren”. “Honored to be host of cordial & substantive dialog between senior Afghan reps. As foreign forces leave Afghanistan, no impediment remains for Afghans of all political stripes to chart a peaceful & prosperous future for the next generation. Iran stands with our Afghan brethren,” Zarif tweeted.  SA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
