 In a statement, ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi also dismissed al-Hariri’s anti-Iran remarks as “unfounded and baseless”, saying Hariri’s allegations are similar to those regularly claimed by the Zionists, Saudis and the United States. “The sudden resignation of Mr. Hariri and his statement in another country is not only ‘surprising’ and ‘regrettable’ but is also an indication of his playing a game designed by those who want ill for the region,” Qassemi lamented. “The sudden resignation of Mr. Hariri and his statement in another country (Saudi Arabia) is not only ‘surprising’ and ‘regrettable’ but is also an indication of his playing a game designed by those who want ill for the region.”  The winner in this game are not Arab or Muslim countries but the Zionist regime (Israel) which has defined its existence in tensions ‘within’ and ‘among’ the Muslim countries in the region,” the spokesperson added. “In a situation when we are approaching the end of Daesh and the adventurism of terrorist groups in some regional countries, attempt should be made to calm the atmosphere so as to compensate the damages that were created by American-reared terrorists and their regional allies, and to reconstruct the wreckage-stricken countries from years of war and destruction.” “Iran has always sought the preservation of peace and stability in regional countries, having defined its interests in the peace, stability, and economic prosperity of all neighboring and regional countries. That is why the country has put the fight against insecurity, instability as well as extremist and terrorist groups high on its regional policy priorities in order to contribute to peace for all countries.”  SP/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
