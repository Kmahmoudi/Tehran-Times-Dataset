TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that Iran is ready to expand ties and cooperation with Iraq in various areas.
 During a meeting with Iraqi Parliament Speaker Mohamed al-Halbousi, Rouhani said Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah, the government and parliament are also determined to establish close and brotherly cooperation with neighboring Iraq. Stability and security in Iraq affect Iran’s security and stability as well, he said. “Iran is ready to expand cooperation (with Iraq) in the areas of economy and infrastructure,” he added. Rouhani is set to pay an official visit to Iraq on March 11 in order to boost ties between the two neighbors amid U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic. A high-ranking delegation is set to accompany the president. Halbousi highlighted the necessity of expanding relations. He also praised Iran’s help in fighting terrorism. Iraq shares a 1,450-kilometer border with Iran. The two countries enjoy close relations in different fields. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also met with the Iraqi official on Wednesday discussing relations and cooperation. The Iraqi parliament speaker also met with Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. Shamkhani warned that the U.S. military presence is a threat against the region. “Experience showed the U.S. is not only not ready to protect nations and governments against terrorists in times of crisis, but even employs all its logistical and intelligence resources to manage terrorism and use it as a tool in the service of its own goals,” Press TV quoted him as saying. Halbousi, for his part, highlighted Iran’s significant role in establishing peace and security in the region, saying his country could not have defeated the terrorists without Iran’s help.
