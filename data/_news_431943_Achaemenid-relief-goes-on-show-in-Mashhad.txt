TEHRAN – A piece of Achaemenid-era (550-330 BC) bas-relief has been put on show at Mashhad’s Khorasan Great Museum, northeast Iran. Several local officials, cultural-heritage experts and academia attended the opening ceremony for the loan exhibit on Tuesday, CHTN reported. The limestone relief, which depicts a Persian guard, was previously on show at the National Museum of Iran for a 22-day exhibit. It was returned to the country after 80 years in September 2018 after a U.S. judge ruled it should be returned to Iran. The relic was confiscated from the Park Avenue Armory in New York in 2017 up while it was up for sale. The relief is originally part of a long line of rock-carved soldiers in the UNESCO-registered Persepolis, southern Iran.
