SEJONG (Yonhap) - South Korea and Iran have agreed to expand their direct flights between Seoul and Tehran to 11 times a week to help bolster bilateral economic cooperation following the lifting of international sanctions against the Middle East country, the government said Wednesday. South Korea and Iran reached an aviation agreement in 1998 to allow South Korean airliners to run four flights of passenger and cargo planes. 
Earlier this year, the Seoul government resumed the Seoul-Tehran air route and gave a flight license to Korean Air Lines Co., the country's largest air carrier.
In an aviation meeting held on Monday and Tuesday, the two countries reached an agreement to increase the number of weekly flights to 11 from the current four to meet rising tourism and business demand for direct flight services, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation. 
The ministry said it will give additional flight permits to other air carriers, including Asiana Airlines Inc., to ferry passengers and air freight 11 times a week between Incheon, the country's main gateway on the outskirts of Seoul, and Tehran. 
"The latest agreement paved the way for more than one South Korean air carrier to offer direct flight services to Iran. We expect it will boost economic and cultural exchange between the two countries," said the ministry. 
The South Korean government decided to open the direct flight route between Seoul and Tehran, which had been closed for decades, as world powers like the United States and Europe have removed political and economic sanctions against Iran earlier this year, which has completed the necessary steps to restrict its nuclear program.
Market watchers said an estimated 40,000 passengers will travel by plane every year between the two countries.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
