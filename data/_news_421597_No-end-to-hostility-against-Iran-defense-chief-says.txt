TEHRAN – Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Monday that the enemies will never end their hostility towards Iran, noting that they are doing all they can to undermine Tehran’s deterrence power. On a visit to Malek-Ashtar University of Technology in Tehran, Brigadier General Hatami said the defense industry needs to collaborate and interact more closely with scientific centers, Mehr reported. He also said Malek Ashtar University can act as a bridge between universities and the defense industry, hoping that “we will witness significant advances in the field of defense industry.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
