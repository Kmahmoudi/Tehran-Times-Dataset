TEHRAN – The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said on Wednesday that the enemy is representing a “false, negative, and disappointing” image of Iran.

 “Today, misrepresentation is the prominent activity of the enemy, aimed at deceiving the public minds in the world and Iran,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told hundreds of academics, directors of knowledge-based companies, researchers, highly talented students, etc. He likened the enemy’s harsh “media and propaganda war” against Iran to the Iraqi imposed war in the 1980s, saying Iran will emerge victorious in this battle too. The Leader described precious human resources and active minds as a “great asset” to the Islamic Republic, saying the enemies and the hegemonic system are trying to plunder such an asset and monopolize the resources that produce wealth and power. The ideas of the young, considerate, energetic and resolved elites must be taken into account in various fields, including Iran’s oil industry, and in turning the oil-dependent economy to an independent, knowledge-based and resistance economy, Ayatollah Khamenei stated. Highlighting the need for scientific progress in the country, he said tapping the talents of brilliant minds will boost the country’s power and minimize its vulnerabilities. “If we make scientific progress, the threats from our civilizational, political, and economic enemies will not be permanent and will diminish,” the Leader remarked. Underlining Iran’s 2-percent share in the global scientific production, Ayatollah Khamenei said Iranian universities have greatly contributed to the country’s advances in aerospace, biological sciences, dam construction, nuclear industry, stem cell research, biotechnology, and recombinant drugs. Stressing the need for scientific research in various fields, the Leader called for closer interaction between universities and industry sector and for scientific cooperation with the countries that are making rapid scientific advances. “Such countries are mainly located in Asia, therefore, we must be oriented to the East, not the West,” Ayatollah Khamenei underlined, warning that orientation towards the West will make the country stranded and humiliated.
