TEHRAN - Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs Hossein-Ali Amiri said on Sunday that a Saturday parliamentary session to cast vote of confidence for four proposed ministers showed the country’s “political maturity”.
 The parliamentary session was an example of “unity between the government and parliament” and was a “show of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s political maturity”, he told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting with Abdul Baseer Anwar, the Afghan minister of Justice, in Tehran. All four ministers proposed by President Hassan Rouhani received votes of confidence from lawmakers in the Saturday session of the Majlis.
