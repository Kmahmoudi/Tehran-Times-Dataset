TEHRAN — A center for brain science for students, aiming to promote scientific study of the brain, will be opened in Book Garden, northern Tehran, in the month of Bahman (January 21-February 19), IRNA reported on Tuesday.
 Secretary for Cognitive Sciences Technologies Council Kamal Kharrazi explained that the project to set up the center requires 12 billion rials (nearly $285,000). The budget is allocated by the Vice presidency for Science and Technology, Tehran Municipality as well as the Cognitive Sciences Technologies Council, he said.  Tehran Municipality has also allocated the space for the center in the Book Garden, Kharrazi added.  Students can actually learn the science of brain by seeing the brain of the human beings and even touching brain tissues at the center, he noted. He went on to say that establishing such centers would play a key role in teaching students science as books cannot be much effective in this regard.  Saeed Ohadi, head of cultural and art organization of Tehran Municipality, for his part, said that the center is comprising 5 main halls introducing the structure of the brain, molecular cell biology of brain, brain diseases, future brains and cognitive sciences.  Ohadi further highlighted that the center would be “first of its kind in the Middle East” putting on display different parts of the brains for visitors of various age groups.  MQ/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
