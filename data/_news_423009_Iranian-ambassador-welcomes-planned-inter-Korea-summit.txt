 “With best wishes for the success of the upcoming high-level talks, I do hope the following Seoul-Pyongyang summit will lead to a turning point toward permanent denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula, Hassan Taherian said in a statement a copy of which sent to the Tehran Times. Following is the text of the ambassador’s statement: It is a great relief and pleasure to witness that after growing tensions and threatening rhetorics in last year, now situation on Korean peninsula is easing down and a reconciliatory atmosphere has been unfolding among the two Koreas since the start of the year with the agreement to hold bilateral talks. No tool can be more useful and effective in resolving regional and international disputes than dialogue and diplomacy and diplomacy is the best choice toward reaching a favorable solution. We appreciate the efforts made by the leaders of both Koreas in line with the improvement of relations, denuclearization and reduction in tensions on Korean peninsula. We are of the belief that nuclear weapons do not ensure world peace and security, therefore we welcome any efforts to promote world sustainable peace and security through elimination of weapons of mass destruction and world denuclearization. With best wishes for the success of the upcoming high-level talks, I do hope the following Seoul-Pyongyang summit will lead to a turning point toward permanent denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula.
