TEHRAN – A number of people and disabled war veterans held a protest rally on Tuesday morning in front of the German embassy in Tehran to show their disgust of Berlin’s interference in Iran’s internal affairs coupled with its role in provoking unrest in the Islamic Republic. The protestors carried placards reminding Germany that it supplied chemical weapons to the regime of Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran in the 1980s. Through their gathering, they refreshed the minds how German-supplied chemical weapons were used against Iranian troops and civilians, particularly the Kurdish women and children in western Iran. Sardasht, an Iranian Kurdish city in West Azarbaijan, was the first city in the world that was attacked with chemical weapons. The citizens were gassed on June 28, 1987. In two separate bombing runs on four residential areas, around 130 people were killed and 8,000 injured. Sardasht came under chemical attack months before the March 1988 attack on the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja. The Kurds in Iran and Iraq were killed or injured by the chemical weapons that Germany supplied to Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, who was famously notorious for his brutality. The residents of the Iranian town of Sardasht have not given up their fight for international recognition of the horrific massacre, which Germany is a complicit. However, the irony is that Germany, among other Western countries, is shedding crocodile tears for Masha Amini, a Kurdish woman from Saqez who was arrested by morality police in Tehran on September 13 and died three days later in hospital. The Forensic Medicine proved that she died because of complications that she had been from a chronic disease. “A number of my comrades and friends were either wounded or martyred because of chemical weapons. According to the documents it was revealed that Germany provided Saddam with the raw materials for building chemical weapons,” a disabled war veteran said, according to Tasnim. In light of these bitter facts, in recent days, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock have in recent days made statement in support of unrest in Iran and making meddlesome remarks. According to a report released by the Iranian Intelligence Ministry on September 8, the German embassy in Tehran was involved in the protests in Iran and that nine nationals from Germany, France, Sweden… were detained in the early days of the riots. Also, in recent days Berlin’s ambassador was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry to hear Tehran’s official protest over the German government’s meddling in the country’s internal affairs and asked explanations from the envoy.
