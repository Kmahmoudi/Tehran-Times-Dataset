TEHRAN- Armenian Prime Minister Karen Karapetyan announced that Armenia is completing the establishment of a free economic zone on the border with Iran, ARKA news agency quoted him addressing the opening of the second Eurasian Partnership international forum in Yerevan.
 "In the near future, we are completing the establishment of a free economic zone on the border with Iran and will sign an agreement with the Iranian side on the special work regime at the border," he said. “Today Armenia can serve as a good platform for the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union and Iran to boost their trade and economic relations,” he added. Earlier in mid-August, in a meeting between Iranian President’s Advisor Akbar Torkan and Armenian Minister of Economic Development and Investments Suren Karayan, the two sides mulled over expansion of cooperation on both sides' free trade zones (FTZs). In the meeting, Torkan named Armenia Iran’s bridge for transporting and exporting goods to Europe, underlining the capability of Iranian contractors in developing free trade zones in Armenia, in case the required infrastructure is provided by the country's government. The Armenian minister, for his part, said that his government has always paid a specific attention to its economic and trade relations with Iran, adding that by manufacturing a wide range of products in their own free trade zones and exporting them to Europe, Iran and Armenia can renovate the region’s economic relations.
