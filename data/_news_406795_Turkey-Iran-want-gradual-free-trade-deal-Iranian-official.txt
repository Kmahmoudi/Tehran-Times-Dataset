A leading Iranian economy official in Ankara has said Turkey and Iran have been in talks to increase the number of items within the scope of their preferential trade deal and the two sides will sign a free trade deal if these items hit 265.
 “Our desire and aim is to make a free trade deal,” said Iran’s Commercial Attaché in Turkey, Hamid Zadboom, in a joint meeting in Ankara, as quoted by Anadolu Agency. Zadboom noted that Turkey made $6.1 billion of imports from Iran last year and exported goods worth $3.7 billion last year. While Turkey’s exports to Iran soared in the first eight months of the year, its imports from Iran decreased, he added. “Both the Iranian side and the Turkish side want to boost the trade volume … If we want to boost our trade volume to $30 billion, we need to triple our commercial transactions. We need to work a lot to achieve this goal,” Zadboom said. The commercial attaché noted that one of the key steps taken by both sides in recent years was the signing of a preferential trade deal. “We are now working to increase the number of commercial items within the scope of the preferential trade deal along with the Turkish Economy Ministry. When this figure exceeds 265, the road will be paved for us to launch a free trade deal. Our aim and target is to make a free trade deal. European countries conduct free trade with each other even during war times. Why shouldn’t Iran and Turkey do this too, as culturally proximate countries?” said Zadboom.
