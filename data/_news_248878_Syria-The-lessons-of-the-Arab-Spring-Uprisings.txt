The Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation remain committed to supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while the United States and its allies continue to plot against the Syrian government in attempt to overthrow Assad. The United States and its allies either fail to see or do not care enough to understand that the removal of Assad will only further tear Syria apart and strengthen Daesh, as well as other terrorist groups. For those truly committed to stopping the expansion of Daesh and ending their reign of terror, it is critical that a regional coalition is formed. And the first step to forming an effective coalition that can defeat Daesh is to accept that President Assad must remain in power.
