TEHRAN – Japanese scholar Sachiko Hosoya has recently published her new book “Reproductive Medicine and the Family in the Middle East” with photos from Iranian photographer Mohammad-Hassan Nikupur.

 “I needed to select photos to depict the culture of Iranian families to the world, therefore I chose photos from a collection by Mohammad-Hassan Nikupur,” Hosoya who is fluent in Persian told IRNA on Wednesday. “This book is a research about the culture of marriage in Iran, Turkey and Egypt,” she added. Hosoya spent about two years traveling countries in the Middle East to complete the book in collaboration with a team of her fellow researchers. The research project began in April 2015 and was completed in March 2017. In her visit to the southern Iranian city of Shiraz in June 2016, she met Nikupur and asked him to take the photos for the book, which has been published by Japan’s Institute of Developing Economies. Hosoya has authored several articles on the anthropology of the Middle East, including “Changes in Attitudes towards Marriage and Reproduction among People with a Genetic Illness: A Study of Patients with Thalassemia in Iran”. She has also collaborated with a research team on “Islam and Diversification of Values - with a gender approach”, a study project that promotes a better understanding of the religion, culture, society, politics and economy in the Middle East and North African region.
