Civilians and militants begin leaving four Syrian towns in the provinces of Idlib and Rif Dimashq under a deal reached between Damascus and militant groups last month.
The process to evacuate Foua and Kefraya in Idlib as well as Zabadani and Madaya in Rif Dimashq was due to start on Wednesday, but it was postponed amid reports of bickering among militant groups.
