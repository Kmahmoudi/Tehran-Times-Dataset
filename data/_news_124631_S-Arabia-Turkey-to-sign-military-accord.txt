During Abdullah's visit to Ankara at the invitation of Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, six bilateral accords will be signed, including one on military cooperation and another on protecting investments, the pan-Arab Al-Hayat said. A 45-strong team of Saudi businessmen will be among the delegation accompanying Abdullah to Turkey, it said. Talks will also cover the Lebanon conflict and other regional issues. The paper said the Saudi monarch will "probably" go on to make an official visit to Spain at the invitation of King Juan Carlos, but gave no details. Riyadh and Madrid announced in April that Saudi and Spanish firms would set up a five-billion-dollar joint investment fund following the signing of an agreement to promote and protect investments.
