TEHRAN - Iraj Masjedi, the Iranian ambassador to Baghdad, has said that a number of Iraqi intellectuals, heads of nomads and members of the Popular Mobilization Forces have come to Iran to help the flood-stricken people.
 “During the past two days, hundreds of Iraqi intellectuals, heads of nomads and members of the Popular Mobilization Forces have come to our country’s embassy (in Baghdad) and consulates in other cities in Iraq to obtain visa and came to Lorestan and Khuzestan to help the flood-stricken people,” he told ISNA in an interview published on Saturday. He noted that the Iraqis’ action shows the friendly relations between the people of the two countries. Over the past days, Iraqi groups have collected aid for the flood-stricken and a part of them has been sent to Iran, he added. He also praised the Iraqi government and people for their help. Since March 19, large parts of Iran have been inundated with flash floods. So far, about 78 people have lost their lives and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. 24 provinces out of 31 have been affected by the flood.
