TEHRAN – In follow-up to the newest IAEA report about Iran’s adherence to the 2015 nuclear agreement, Iran’s chief diplomat Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday that the nuclear deal signatories must abide by their commitment instead of making “extraneous demands”.
 French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday that Tehran should be ready to negotiate on its future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in Syria and Yemen. The remarks by Le Drian is a repetition of demands made by President Donald Trump who withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “If preserving JCPOA is the goal, then there is no escape from mustering the courage to comply with commitment to normalize Iran's economic relations instead of making extraneous demands,” Zarif tweeted. Under the nuclear agreement, Iran is obliged to put caps on its nuclear work in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions. Iran has threatened that if its economic interests are not fulfilled it will see no reason to stay in the deal. Zarif renewed Iran’s warning by saying sticking to the nuclear accord is not the only way forward for Iran. “Being the party to still honor the deal in deeds & not just words is not Iran's only option,” Zarif added. A confidential report by the UN atomic watchdog said on Thursday that Iran has remained within the main restrictions on its nuclear activities.
