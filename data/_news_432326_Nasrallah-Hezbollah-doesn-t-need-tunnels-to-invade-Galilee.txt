TEHRAN - In a long-awaited interview on al-Mayadeen TV late on Saturday, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah refuted as “lies” all rumors about his health condition. “All the things being said about my health condition are lies and I don’t suffer from any disease or problem,” the Hezbollah leader asserted. Nasrallah also confirmed that there have been tunnels at the border between Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories. He said the delay in discovering tunnels proves the failure of Israeli intelligence.  "Netanyahu served Hezbollah since he caused fear among Israelis."Last month Israel targeted the cross-border tunnels dug by Hezbollah. Israel called the attack on the tunnels “Northern Shield” Operation. Nasrallah said the Hezbollah leadership decided not to comment on the operation at the time. The Hezbollah chief also told Israelis that they should not believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the issue of tunnels is closed, asking: “Do you believe Netanyahu that the issue of tunnels is over?” He said Netanyahu claimed that the tunnels operation was aimed at preparing to confront Hezbollah’s plan to invade Galilee. However, in his interview with al-Mayadeen, the Nasrallah said, “Hezbollah doesn’t need tunnels to invade Galilee.”   In fact, through his remarks on tunnels Netanyahu “served Hezbollah since he caused fear among Israelis,” the Hezbollah leader noted. However, Nasrallah said, “In any future (war) we are capable of getting into Galilee.”   He added, “Following the Syria war it has been easier for Hezbollah to get into Galilee; we have found solutions to deal with the Israelis walls.”   The Hezbollah leader went on to say that “it’s our right to take all required measures in order to defend our country.”  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
