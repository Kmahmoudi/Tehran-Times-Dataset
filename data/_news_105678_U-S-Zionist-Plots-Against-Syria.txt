The Zionist regime early Sunday launched its deepest military strike inside Syria in 30 years, targeting what it claimed was a Palestinian militant training base northwest of Damascus used by the Palestinian resistance groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Islamic Jihad denied it has bases in Syria, while Syria said only civilian areas were hit in the raid. The attack came a day after a martyrdom-seeking operation in Haifa. Some analysts believe that Washington gave its ally a green light to carry out the attack, although White House spokesman Scott McClellan denied it, saying the United States had no foreknowledge of the plan. Also, U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Washington would not support a Syrian-proposed UN Security Council resolution denouncing the raid unless it also sharply condemned attacks on Israelis. Meanwhile, Israel welcomed the fact that Washington took new steps toward imposing sanctions on Syria on Thursday, and an Israeli general threatened more military action against Syria. The Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives voted 33-2 on Wednesday in favor of diplomatic and economic sanctions, accusing Syria of supporting terrorism and developing weapons of mass destruction. The White House announced that it would not oppose the bill when it comes before the full House. These actions and statements illustrate the fact that Israel and the U.S. are making concerted efforts to pressure Syria militarily, economically, and politically. U.S. officials should not think that they can deceive the world by saying the Zionist regime has a right to defend itself. Israel has trampled on international law by violating the territorial integrity of a foreign state and by doing so it is pushing the region into another war. U.S. officials have knowingly or unknowingly been trapped in a Zionist plot which may have serious consequences for the region and the world. The Zionist regime has occupied Arab lands with U.S. military and political support since 1948. U.S. and Israeli officials should know that their recent actions have revived bitter memories of the 1967 and 1973 wars in which Israel occupied Arab lands such as Syria’s Golan Heights. So how can Israeli and U.S. officials talk about Middle East peace while one country launches air raids against another country and the other implicitly endorses it? Furthermore, Washington and Tel Aviv have accused Syria of giving support to Palestinian resistance groups and trying to sabotage the entire peace process and the road map in particular. However, the Zionist regime and the U.S. can no longer influence world public opinion through such accusations. Even some Israelis believe the Palestinians have the right to resist the occupation of their homeland. Furthermore, the Palestinian resistance is self-sustaining and needs no outside assistance, as history has shown. Instead of accusing others, it would be better to look at the root cause of the problem and implement the UN resolutions which call on Israel to withdraw from the territories it occupied in 1967 and 1973. Otherwise, the U.S.-Zionist plots against Syria could push the region into another war and things could get out of control.
