TEHRAN – On Thursday, Pakistan’s minister for railways carried a joint letter from his country’s President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

 Sheikh Rasheed handed over the written text to Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to the Leader.  During the meeting, Rasheed hoped for development of ties between Tehran and Islamabad and underlined that Imran Khan is willing to enhance Pakistan’s relations with all countries, including Iran. Velayati, for his part, said, “Relations between Iran and Pakistan are brotherly, good and constructive,” adding that promotion of economic cooperation and establishment of a railroad linking Iran, Pakistan and China could further strengthen ties. However, he said, incidents like a recent attack on Iranian forces by terrorists who entered Iran’s Sistan-Balouchestan province from Pakistan do harm to the relations. Velayati called on Pakistan to make more efforts to ensure the security in common borders and put an end to terrorist attacks against Iran by groups based in Pakistan. Pakistan should not allow other countries like Saudi Arabia and the Zionists to undermine Tehran-Islamabad ties and foment crises along the common border, Velayati pointed out. He said the terrorist groups that recently killed a number of Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) forces receive equipment and financial support from Saudi Arabia and Israel. On Feb. 13, a suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying IRGC personnel on Khash-Zahedan road in the border province of Sistan-Baluchistan. 27 IRGC soldiers were killed and 13 others injured. The so-called Jaish ul-Adl group, which is based in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack. Iranian military forces along the southeastern border areas are frequently attacked by terrorist groups coming from Pakistan. Tehran has frequently asked Pakistan to step up security at the common borders to prevent terrorist attacks on Iranians.
