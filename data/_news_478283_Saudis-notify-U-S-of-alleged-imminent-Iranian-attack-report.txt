TERHAN – Saudi Arabia has informed the United States of alleged imminent attack from Iran, several Western media outlets reported. “Saudi Arabia has shared intelligence with the U.S. warning of an imminent attack from Iran on targets in the kingdom, putting the American military and others in the Middle East on an elevated alert level, said Saudi and U.S. officials,” the Wall Street Journal claimed. It added, “In response to the warning, Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and several other neighboring states have raised the level of alert for their military forces, the officials said. They didn’t provide more details on the Saudi intelligence.” Reuters also reported that the U.S. has received intelligence from Saudi Arabia warning of an attack from Iran. It said the U.S. is concerned about these alleged threats from Iran against Saudi Arabia. “We are concerned about the threat picture, and we remain in constant contact through military and intelligence channels with the Saudis,” said a spokesperson from the U.S. National Security Council, according to Reuters. “We will not hesitate to act in the defense of our interests and partners in the region.” Tensions have been on the rise between Tehran and Riyadh over the last few weeks. And Iran has warned Saudi Arabia against interfering in Iran’s internal affairs amid a wave of unrest that erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini, a young girl who fainted in police custody on September 13 and died three days later in hospital. But Iran didn’t say it will attack Saudi Arabia. The chief of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), General Hossein Salami has warned the United States and its regional allies against exacerbating the unrest in Iran. Speaking on the sideline of a recent IRGC military exercise on the border with the South Caucasus region, General Salami said Saudi Arabia is playing media games with the Iranian youth. “We are warning them in this regard,” he said, according to state news agency IRNA. “They are openly seeking to provoke our youth. We advise them to exert control over these media outlets. Otherwise, they will pay the price,” he said. General Salami then directly addressed the Saudis and said, “Note that you have entered this field and know that you are vulnerable. You better be careful.” In another speech delivered at the funeral ceremony for the victims of the Daesh-claimed attack in Shiraz, General Salami said that the Biden administration, together with its allies in the region, stand behind the unrest. Addressing Iranian youth, the general said Biden isn’t directly ordering Iranian youth to take to the streets. Instead, he is using complex ways to instigate unrest in Iran, including through the media, the general added. Salami added the unrest in Iran was planned in American and Israeli think tanks.
