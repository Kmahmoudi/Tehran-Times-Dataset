TEHRAN – During Noruz holidays (March 20-April 1), some 1.845 million tourists paid visit to 19 historic sites in Iran registered on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage.

Gonbad-e Qabus, a 1006-AD decagon baked-brick-built tower in northern Golestan Province, was at the bottom of the list. The Iran’s UNESCO-registered sites earned over 177 thousand dollars by visitors during Noruz, the Mehr news agency reported on Thursday.
