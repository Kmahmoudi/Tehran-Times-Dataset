In this regard, we will strengthen our cooperation and synergy with friendly and allied countries, including Russia,” Sayyari stated.  The commander also stated that the Iranian Army is fully prepared to work with Russia on enhancing military competitions, conducting maritime patrols and exercises, ensuring economic security, implementing counterterrorism measures, conducting maritime search and rescue operations and trainings, and assisting damaged vessels.
