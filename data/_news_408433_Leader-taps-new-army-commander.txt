TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei appointed on Saturday Brigadier General Kiomars Heidari as the new commander of the Iranian army’s ground forces.  Heidari, 52, entered service in 1984 in the thick of the Iraqi invasion of Iran. Prior to his promotion he had served as the second-in-command of the army’s ground forces since 2007.  Heidari replaced Ahmadreza Pourdastan who was at helm since 2008.
The Leader has urged the newly appointed Heidari to upgrade intelligence and operational preparations of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army to meet modern warfare demands.   
The Leader emphasized that the appointment has been made on the recommendation of the Commander of Army Major General Ataollah Salehi.
Also, in a separate decree, Ayatollah Khamenei appointed Pourdastan to serve as the second-in-command of the Iranian Army.
The appointments come after Ayatollah Khamenei in June named Major General Mohammad Hossein Baqeri as the Armed Forces Chief of Staff.
Baqeri replaced Major General Hassan Firouzabadi who was holding the position as of 1989 and will be serving hereafter as advisor to the Leader.  MH/AK
