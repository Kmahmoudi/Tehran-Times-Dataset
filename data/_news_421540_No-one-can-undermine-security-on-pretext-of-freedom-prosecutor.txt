TEHRAN – Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi, the Tehran prosecutor general, said on Saturday that no one is allowed to disturb security in the country on the pretext of freedom.

Investigation on the issue is still ongoing, he said. He also lauded the police’s tolerance in dealing with the unrest, saying the Islamic Republic will confront rioters, and at the same time, will observe their rights.
