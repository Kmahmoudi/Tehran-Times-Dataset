TEHRAN – Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, speaker of the Iranian Parliament, has reportedly said that the United States seeks to destabilize Iran. Qalibaf made the remarks in a session of the Islamic Revolution Faction at the Iranian Parliament.  Abolfazl Amouei, a lawmaker who attended the session spoke to IRNA and offered some details of the discussions that took place in the session, which was held on Monday. “Today's meeting was held to review the recent events in the country and to analyze and clarify the issues and reach the right solutions. At the beginning of this meeting, the chairman of the National Security Committee presented a report on the actions of the parliament in the current events and emphasized the duty of the parliament in diagnosing the roots and causes of the crisis,” Amouei said.  He added, “Qalibaf, the head of the parliament's Revolution Faction, also presented a comprehensive analysis of the enemies' actions in the past years to attack the Islamic system, and emphasized that despite the enemy's mischief, the Islamic Revolution has moved forward in the past 43 years and has become stronger day by day. He said these recent abuses are a reaction to the country's forward movement.” Amouei noted, “By presenting an analysis of the progress of the Resistance Front in the region, the speaker of the parliament considered the American response plan to deal with Iran as internal destabilization, and he predicted that this plan would also fail.” Iranian President Ayatollah Seyed Ebrahim Raisi made similar remarks on Sunday. Speaking at a cabinet session, he said the U.S. is happy with the insecurity in Iran. “The comments of the American president in support of chaos, terror and insecurity in Iran once again proved the falseness of the claim of protecting human rights, security and peace and gave meaning to the title of the great Satan,” Raisi said.  He added, “The comments of the American president, who allows himself to incite chaos, terror and destruction in another country, are reminiscent of the eternal words of the founder of the Islamic Republic, who called America the great Satan.” Ayatollah Raisi stated that the Americans feel angry about every good, innovative and creative movement of the Iranian nation, and they feel joy and happiness about the shortcomings or problems as well as about the insecurities. He pointed out that in recent events, the enemy seeks to induce despair, and this enemy's conspiracy must be countered with effective measures to advance affairs and solve people's problems. A senior lawmaker has said that based on the reports provided by the Iranian intelligence agencies, foreign agents played a key role in the recent riots in Iran. “The reports conducted by the intelligence and security agencies on the recent riots indicate that foreign agents played a key role in planning to cause the riots,” Abbas Moqtadaei, the deputy head of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Parliament, said in an interview with IRNA published on Sunday.  Moqtadaei added, “According to these reports, the recent unrest was not caused by a spontaneous and endogenous approach of the people, but the opponents of the Islamic Republic used the death of the late Mahsa Amini as an excuse. Foreign espionage was used to cause chaos in the country by inciting people's feelings.” Referring to the briefing presented by Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in the parliamentary committee, the representative of the people of Isfahan underlined that as per the foreign minister’s report, even Iranian embassies and missions abroad were attacked by some NGOs and mercenaries a few hours after the riots began inside the country.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
