TEHRAN - Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said Donald Trumpâ€™s stance on the nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers will not have much impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported citing Iranian TVs. Trump refused on Friday to formally certify that Tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is. He warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement.
