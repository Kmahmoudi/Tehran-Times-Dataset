TEHRAN - The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday warned that any normalization of relations between some Arab governments and the regime in Israel will not contribute to stability and security in the region. “We believe that developing ties and the normalization of relations between Arab and Muslim countries and the Israeli regime will not contribute to strengthening stability, security and peace in the region, nor will it contribute to upholding the rights of the Palestinian people,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told a weekly press conference following incoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments on normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia. “The Palestinian nation has not welcomed the normalization of relations. The nations in the region have also shown that they do not welcome the normalization of relations between some Islamic and Arab governments and the Israeli regime, and they do not accept it,” he added, according to Press TV. The diplomat further stressed that Iran’s position toward the Israeli entity is clear, noting that the Palestinian people expect the countries of the region to defend their rights. Earlier, Netanyahu claimed that normalization with Saudi Arabia would lead to a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
