Iran is shipping more than 1,000 tons of fruits and vegetables to Qatar every day.
 The Gulf Times reported that Iran has taken the move after some Persian Gulf Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia cut relations with Doha. On June 5, Saudi Arabia along with the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and introduced sanctions on the country for its relations with the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.  Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain also closed their air, sea, and land routes to the country. Qatar imports about 40 percent of its food from Saudi Arabia, the only country that has land border with Qatar. “We will continue sending such cargos while there is still request from the Qatari side,” Iran Air spokesman Shahrokh Nooshabadi said recently. The Islamic republic has also opened its airspace to about 100 more Qatari flights a day. Reuters reported on Friday that the four Arab states boycotting Qatar have sent Doha a list of 13 demands including closing Al Jazeera television and reducing ties to Iran, an official of one of the four countries said. Doha's independent-minded approach, including a dovish line on Iran and support for Islamist groups, in particular the Muslim Brotherhood, has incensed some of its neighbors who see political Islamism as a threat to their dynastic rule. The list also demands the closing of a Turkish military base in Qatar, the official told Reuters.
