TEHRAN – Iran unveiled on Monday five new military products, including a guided rocket and assault weapons. The military products included Fajr 5 guided artillery rocket, Misagh 3 shoulder-fired missile, a 40-milimeter grenade launcher, a caliber gun and a pistol. During a ceremony in Tehran, Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan announced that Iran will mass produce the state-of-the-art defense equipment. Speaking at the ceremony, Dehqan said the production of the new weapons will boost Iran’s air defense power and the military forces’ capabilities in armed combats. Dehqan hailed the Islamic Republic’s self-sufficiency in arms production and the diversity of the weapons produced. He noted that the weapons produced by the Defense Ministry have increased by 69 percent during the last three years. “During this time, over 115 types of defense systems and new military products have been manufactured and put to use,” he added. The Islamic Republic has made great advances in recent years in manufacturing a broad range of military equipment and systems. In its latest show of force in the north-central province of Semnan which started on Saturday, the IRGC demonstrated the country’s military might, intelligence command and defense capabilities. The military exercise was conducted a day after the U.S. government imposed new sanctions on Tehran due to an alleged ballistic missile test. During the drills, different missiles and radar systems were showcased. A day before the beginning of the military exercise, U.S. President Donald Trump said Tehran was “playing with fire”. Iranian Foreign Ministry dismissed reports that the military drills were intended to send a message to the new U.S. administration. “There is no need to test Mr. Trump as we have heard his views on different issues in recent days... We know him quite well,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said. MH/PA
