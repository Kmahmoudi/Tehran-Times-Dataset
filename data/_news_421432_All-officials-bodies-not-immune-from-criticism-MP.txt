TEHRAN – All of the country’s authorities as well as the entire system can be criticized, MP Hossein Naqavi Hosseini has said, emphasizing that officials should be held accountable for their actions. “When the Supreme Leader says even he himself can be criticized, this means that all of the establishment’s bodies and officials can be criticized and must respond to criticism logically,” Naqavi Hosseini was quoted as saying by ISNA on Tuesday. However, he said, criticism should be fair and also distinguishable from slander because “criticism is beneficial but slander is detrimental”.
