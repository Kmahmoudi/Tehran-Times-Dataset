TEHRAN – Iran’s ATA Airlines will open a weekly route from Mashhad to Islamabad on Saturday with return legs to be operated on the same days. The service is expected to open up a new chapter in widening tourist-flows, particularly in religious travels between Iran and Pakistan, IRNA reported on Tuesday. Last September, Kish Airlines carried out its maiden direct flight between Tehran and Islamabad. Some other Iranian airlines, namely Iran Air, Taban Air and Mahan Air, have already established non-stop flights to various cities in Pakistan.
