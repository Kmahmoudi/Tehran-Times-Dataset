TEHRAN- Exports of five types of goods will be ceased due to a recent decision of the Ministry of Industry announced to the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA) on Saturday, IRIB reported on Monday. Accordingly, exports of packing paper, newsprint, tissue paper, powdered milk, bulk and packed tea, and over 500g packets of butter will be prohibited since August 23 in an effort to set the domestic market, the report said. The imposed ban would be removed by the decision of the Ministry of Industry. Due to renewal of U.S.-led sanctions, the administration is doing some amendments about the country’s exports and imports regulations. In line with the implementation of the Supreme Leader’s policies in supporting Iran-made products and in order to maximize the use of domestic products and services, main companies and their subcontractors (directly or indirectly) are prohibited from purchasing some foreign products and equipment. For instance, as reported earlier, Iranian Oil Ministry has also passed an order to ban the import of 84 items among oil industry equipment which could be produced inside the country.
