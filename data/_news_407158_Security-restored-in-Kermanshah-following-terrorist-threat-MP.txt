TEHRAN – MP Seyyed Qasem Jasemi has said that maximum security has been restored in Kermanshah province after the IRGC’s latest clashes with members of a terrorist cell. “A few days ago, IRGC forces clashed with 12 members of a terrorist cell named PJAK in Kermanshah,” explained Jasemi, who sits on the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee. “They had sneaked into Kermanshah province in order to seek an opportunity to carry out terrorist operations, but were identified by IRGC and local forces.”  Jasemi added, “None of the members of the terrorist cell could manage to escape the local and IRGC forces, and all 12 members were killed.” Only three members of IRGC forces were mildly injured, said Jasemi who represents the city of Kermanshah in the Majlis. Kermanshah is the capital of Kermanshah province.
Jasemi noted that provoking terrorist groups, including Daesh and PJAK, is a strategy adopted by enemies. The MP also praised the IRGC, Basij, and local forces for nipping the threat in the bud. IRGC announced on Tuesday that it had dismantled a terrorist cell, killing twelve of its members in the western province of Kermanshah. IRGC Ground Force Commander Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour said significant sums of weapons and ammunition were seized from the terrorists. In a similar incident more than two weeks ago, four members of a Kurdish terrorist cell were arrested in western Iran.
