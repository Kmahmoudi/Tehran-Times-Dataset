TEHRAN – Tehran on Tuesday expressed dismay over Bahraini forces’ raid on the residence of Sheikh Isa Qassim, the spiritual leader of the country’s Shia majority in the small caliphate, saying it further “complicates” the situation in the country.  Cracking down on the protestors and pursuing an ethnic and religious approach to the Bahraini people do not help the country to settle the crisis and derail peaceful demonstrations, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman said.  The raid comes two days after Sheikh Qassim was given a one-year suspended jail sentence for alleged corruption.
