TEHRAN – A senior Iranian nuclear energy official said on Wednesday that Tehran is ready to enrich uranium beyond previous levels in case the remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear agreement fail to salvage it. Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said that the country “will reach even more advanced levels” of uranium enrichment if the other parties leave the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Press TV reported, citing IRIB. He also said that the Islamic Republic’s nuclear activities are moving forward at a favorable pace.
