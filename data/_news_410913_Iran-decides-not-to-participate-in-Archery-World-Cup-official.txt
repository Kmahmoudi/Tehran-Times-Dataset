The U.S. has lifted a ban on Iranian archers who were planning to compete in a world archery event in Las Vegas, but the Persians will not participate in the competition since their visas were issued late.   Mohammadali Shojaei, head of Iran's Archery Federation, said that the visas have been issued just three days prior to the three-day Indoor Archery World Cup, which has been scheduled to start on Friday. "Since the visas were issued late by the U.S. Embassy in Armenia, our four archers are not able to partake in the competition. We have no enough time to travel to the U.S.," Shojaei added. The order U.S. President Donald Trump signed Jan. 27 -- just a week into his term as president -- bars nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 90 days, and freezes the government's entire refugee program for 120 days. Syrians are banned indefinitely, while Syrian Christians are prioritized for entry. Before it was halted following a Seattle, Washington, federal court's restraining order last Friday, the executive action caused tens of thousands of visa revocations and dozens of arrests at airports, triggering mass demonstrations across the country. In reaction to the ban, Iran on Friday announced that the U.S. wrestlers were banned from entering the country to compete in a freestyle World Cup. The ban was lifted Sunday following the restraining order. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
