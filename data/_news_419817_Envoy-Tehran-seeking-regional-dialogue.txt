TEHRAN – Iran's Ambassador to Moscow, Mehdi Sanaei, has reiterated that Tehran’s policy is to help resolve regional crises through peaceful means, saying the Islamic Republic is seeking to create stability in the Middle East. Speaking at a meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov in Moscow on Thursday, Sanaei said, “No one will benefit from the continuation of these crises and conflicts,” Tasnim reported. He added that if the problems are not resolved through dialogue among regional countries, hegemonic powers will cast a greedy eye on the region. MH/PA
