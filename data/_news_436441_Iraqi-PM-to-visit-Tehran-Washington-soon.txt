TEHRAN – Iraq’s Prime Minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, announced on Tuesday that he will be visiting Tehran and Washington in the near future. Citing regional developments and rising rifts between Iran and the U.S., the Iraqi leader welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest statements that he does not seek war with Iran. The prime minister also said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s recent trip to Iraq also had a clear message.
