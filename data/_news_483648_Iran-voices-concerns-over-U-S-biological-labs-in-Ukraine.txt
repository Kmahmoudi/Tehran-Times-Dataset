TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani has reacted to reports that the U.S. has established military biological labs in Ukraine, saying the labs are “deeply worrying.” “Reports about the US military biological labs in Ukraine and some other countries are deeply worrying,” Kanaani said on Twitter.  He added, “These activities are in breach of the US's commitments, especially the Biological Weapons Convention, and pose a threat to humanity, hence they need an impartial international investigation.” A Russian state Duma committee has recently released a report saying that Washington is building biological weapons all over the world, according to IRNA.  American-made biological weapons are able to destroy not only human beings, but also animals and even agricultural products to cause irreparable economic damage to the enemy.  The Russian investigation committee called the possibility of covert use of biological weapons as completely peaceful industrial products alarming. The Russian Duma assessed the American biological weapons program as the greatest threat to the biological security of the world. “In recent years, the U.S. biological weapons program has not only not been limited, but has become more aggressive,” it said.  The presence of American biological laboratories in Africa, Asia, the Caucasus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine has provided the basis for collecting information on the biological infrastructure of the host countries, according to the Russian state Duma.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
