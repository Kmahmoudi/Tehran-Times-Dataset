TEHRAN – Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force, said on Sunday that the enemies have seriously tried to sabotage Iran’s missiles. “In the field of missiles, the enemies recently announced that they are after sabotaging parts shipped to Iran… However, we have seen this for 7-8 years but have not articulated it,” Hajizadeh said, Mehr reported. The enemies have done everything they could in order to prevent our missiles from hitting targets, he said, “But we took the enemies’ enmity seriously and did our strengthening policies.” The general also said the Feb. 13 suicide attack against IRGC border guards in which 27 lost their lives was carried out by Pakistani nationals who serve as Saudi mercenaries.
