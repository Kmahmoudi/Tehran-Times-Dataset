TEHRAN - Representative of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Tehran says “the Zionist regime is formed on the basis of a violation of human rights backed by the world's greatest powers.” As a guest of the Tehran Times at the Press Exhibition in Tehran, Nasser Abu Sharif said, “In fact, there is no human rights in the world; it is all a sham in the hands of powerful states.” Following is an excerpt of the interview: Q: In your opinion, have the Palestinians made a remarkable move to grab the world’s attention to the crimes committed by Israel? A: First of all, you can see every day signs of protest in every corner of the Palestinian territory. For instance, silence strikes, candlelight vigils, strikes in support of prisoners, and so on. The normalization of relations between the Arab countries has paved the way for those who formerly condemned the Zionist regime today embrace it.”Every Friday, a rally against Israeli settlements is held in which fighters even from the other side of the borders join in. And all the national and international media are there to cover it. But a regime like the Zionist regime is formed on the basis of a violation of human rights backed by the world's greatest powers such as England, France and the United States. The Zionist regime is a ruthless regime, set on the violation of human rights and intentional law. It continues to commit crimes against the Palestinian people and constructs settlements in the occupied territory of Palestine.
Underneath objections to Israeli settlements lies plenty of support otherwise Netanyahu couldn’t dare to publicly declare the construction of settlements.
If an Israeli soldier is killed, the whole world will protest; the United States and its president condemn the killing of the soldier. That is not only because of the power of Israel, but to suppress the Palestinians with no regard for humanity. In fact, there is no human rights in the world; it is all a sham in the hands of powerful states. There are no rights for the vulnerable and oppressed people. And the other thing is that, unfortunately, the Arab and Islamic world cannot form a united front and therefore they are frail. Q:  Mr. Abu Sharif, did you expect the prime minister of a highly important country like India to be a guest of Netanyahu? What do you make of that?
A: The (Indian) prime minister's trip to Israel is unfortunate. The normalization of relations between the Arab countries and Israel has paved the way for those who formerly condemned the Zionist regime embrace it today. Underneath objections to Israeli settlements lies plenty of support, otherwise Netanyahu couldn’t dare to publicly declare the construction of settlements.
When a country like Saudi Arabia maintains both ‘secret’ and ‘open’ relations with Israel, India’s relationship won’t be a match to that of Saudi’s with Israel in terms of closeness. They justify their relations with Israel on the pretext of examining the issue of Palestine and the Arab world.
In our view, the recognition of the Zionist regime as a state should remain ‘unacceptable in the Arab and Islamic world’. The recognition of this regime is unacceptance in terms of humanity, religion, nationality, and ethnicity as its recognition as a state will prepare the ground for the rest of the world to establish an ‘existential’ relationship with it.
