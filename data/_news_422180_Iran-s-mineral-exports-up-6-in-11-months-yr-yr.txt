TEHRAN- Iran exported $8.4 billion of minerals during the 11-month period ended on February 19, with six percent rise from the figure of the same period of time in the previous year, according to Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization (IMIDRO). As IMIDRO announced, the weight of minerals exported in the said time fell three percent to 58.099 million tons, IRIB news reported on Sunday. Iran is one of the top 10 mineral-rich countries where 68 types of minerals have been identified so far, including the world’s largest deposits of copper, zinc and iron ore, which are tempting international investors after the lifting of West-led sanctions against the country in January 2016.  MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
