TEHRAN- Iran has true potential to manufacture plasma-derived medicinal products as it has high-quality plasma, said an official with Iranian Food and Drug Administration.  Plasma is the largest single component of blood, and makes up about 55% of total blood volume. It is a vital source material for a number of plasma-derived medications that treat and prevent life-threatening diseases, illnesses and conditions. Plasma can't be created in a laboratory; rather, it is usually derived from people donating their plasma.  “By using its own plasma, Iran can locally produce 100 percent of its requirement to Factor IX (nine) and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) and 30 percent of its needs to Factor VIII (eight),” said Dr. Ali Vasheqani, head of the biology department at the Food and Drug Administration.  Factor eight and nine are essential blood-clotting proteins; they are used to treat hemophilia and some bleeding disorders.  “Currently, the plasma collected by Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO) and some private organizations are sent to European countries, so the required medicine is produced and is sent back to the country,” said Vasheqani, IRNA reported on Friday. “According to European medical manufacturers, Iran’s plasma is among the top in the world in terms of quality, virus safety and stability,” Vasheqani noted. “World Health Organization has named Iran a successful example of using its own plasma for manufacturing the medicine required for treating rare, life-threatening diseases,” he added. According to Vasheqani, increasing the provision of plasma and setting up plasma processing units are now among the top objectives of the Food and Drug Administration.   “Usually, the countries who want to send their plasma for processing to another country, first dispatch some inspectors to screen and endorse the plasma-recipient centers of the target country. Fortunately, the IBTO and other Iranian private centers have been approved in all inspections and it means that we are following all the necessary standards and we are perfectly ready to produce such medicines,” he concluded.  SJ/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
