TEHRAN - The International Court of Justice (ICJ) plans to announce its ruling on Iran’s complaint against the U.S. sanctions on Wednesday.
 The ICJ held a hearing in August on Iran’s lawsuit against the U.S. over its move in re-imposing unilateral sanctions. On July 16, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran had filed a complaint at the ICJ against the U.S. for reintroducing sanctions. “Today Iran filed a complaint @CIJ_ICJ to hold U.S. accountable for its unlawful re-imposition of unilateral sanctions. Iran is committed to the rule of law in the face of U.S. contempt for diplomacy & legal obligations. It’s imperative to counter its habit of violating int’l law,” Zarif tweeted. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and reimposed sanctions. The first batch of sanctions snapped back on August 6 and the second batch will be returned on November 4. Iran and the U.S. signed the Treaty of Amity in 1955 which is still valid according to international law. The treaty consists of an introduction and twenty-three articles and emphasizes encouraging mutual trade and investments.
