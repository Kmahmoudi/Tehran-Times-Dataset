In a meeting between the foreign ministers of Iran and Qatar, they also reviewed strategies for enhancing economic and commercial ties between their two energy-rich countries. Additionally, they talked about the revival of the Iran nuclear agreement with foreign powers and lifting of U.S. sanctions against the nation.
