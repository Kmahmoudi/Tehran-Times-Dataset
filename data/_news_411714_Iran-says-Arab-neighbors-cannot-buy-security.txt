TEHRAN – The Iranian defense minister has said that certain Arab neighbors should know that they cannot “buy security”, calling on them to think other ways to ensure their security. “If the Persian Gulf littoral countries want to buy security and give big money to buy equipment they should know such things would not secure them. It is even anti-security because the owners of the equipment would only need to withhold the equipment,” Hossein Dehqan said on Monday, Mehr reported. SP/PA
