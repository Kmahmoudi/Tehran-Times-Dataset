TEHRAN – Responding to an anti-Iran video by national security advisor John Bolton, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy has warned that Bolton is knowingly lying to build momentum for a U.S. military attack on Iran. “Here Bolton says Iran is seeking nuclear weapons. This simply isn't true. The intelligence says the opposite and he knows it,” Murphy wrote on his Twitter account on Tuesday. “He is laying the groundwork for war and we all must be vigilant.” In a video posted to the White House’s official Twitter page on Monday, Bolton echoed false assertions and repeatedly debunked claims by the Trump administration that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons.
