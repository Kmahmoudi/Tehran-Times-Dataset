TEHRAN – Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the Iran nuclear deal, saying “it’s working” and has made the region and the world “safer”. In a sit-down with CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour, Kerry expressed bewilderment over U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to decertify the deal, known as the JCPOA. He also pointed out that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has eight times certified Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA, saying having tougher sanctions on Iran than North Korea just “doesn’t make sense”.
