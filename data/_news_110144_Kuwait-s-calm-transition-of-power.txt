Despite the fact that the Kuwaiti emir had appointed his brother, Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, to oversee the day-to-day activities of the Kuwaiti government, due to his own illness and the weak physical condition of the 76-year-old Kuwaiti crown prince, Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti emir played a prominent role in the political life of the country. Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah was a distinguished figure in both the Middle East and the entire Arab world who sincerely endeavored to solve the problems of the Islamic world, particularly the Palestine issue and regional problems. The late emir of Kuwait also played a significant role in the liberation of the country from occupation by Saddam Hussein’s troops in 1991. In that year, Kuwait was in a very difficult situation, since the former Iraqi regime had no intention of withdrawing from Kuwaiti territory. However, the solidarity of the Kuwaiti nation and government as well as the contributions of the international community helped to defeat the Iraqi Baathist army and force the Iraqi troops to withdraw after a seven-month occupation. The late Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah made serious diplomatic efforts for the liberation of Kuwait which the Kuwaiti nation will never forget. Nevertheless, the recent demise of the emir of Kuwait, who governed the country for 28 years, will definitely not create a political vacuum in the country because Kuwait has had a parliament for over 40 years. Although the Sabah family holds the power in Kuwait, the legislative, judiciary, and executive branches of government do not interfere in one another’s affairs. In fact, the emir acts as a supervisor and coordinator of the three branches of government and the prime minister heads the executive branch. Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah has been the Kuwaiti prime minister for ten years and has efficiently carried out his duties. Therefore, since the succession of power in the Sabah family is clearly outlined in the Kuwaiti Constitution, it is predicted that the country will face no problems in foreign or domestic affairs due to the death of the emir. Kuwait is one of the only Arab countries with a somewhat empowered parliament. The Kuwait legislature is even authorized to question the Sabah dynasty on the performance of its duties, which is a check which prevents corruption. Thanks to the existence of powerful civil and legal institutions in Kuwait, the death of the emir will cause no complications in the political life of the country and no fundamental change will probably occur in its foreign policy. However, at this juncture, the Kuwaiti nation should pay special attention to both domestic and regional vulnerabilities, while at the same time making efforts to further democratize the conservative country, so that Kuwait can maintain its regional and international status.
