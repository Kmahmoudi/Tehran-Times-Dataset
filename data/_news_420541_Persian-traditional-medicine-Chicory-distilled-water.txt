From past time, Chicory distilled water, called Araq-e Kasni in Persian, has been on hand in most Iranian houses.

 With its cooling characteristics, Chicory distilled water reduces body temperature and is great for liver diseases. It decreases the amount of yellow bile in the liver.  Yellow bile facilitates the transfer of blood and nutrients from capillaries to the remote body organs and is also in charge of metabolism of fats and lipids and ease digestion. However, in case it gets abundant in the body it can trigger some health conditions such as liver disorders. 
 
Chicory distilled water is diuretic and has laxative effects. Chicory has been listed as one of the 38 plants that are used to prepare bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine. However, according to Cancer Research UK, "there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer".
