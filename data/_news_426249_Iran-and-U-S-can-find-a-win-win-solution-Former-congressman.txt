TEHRAN - Former U.S. Congressman, James Charles Slattery, says President Trump may be looking for a way to re-engage Iran and solve some of his concerns about the JCPOA and then reengage the diplomatic process. “Both sides would be wise to try and find a win-win solution to the current impasse! Further escalation of words will do nothing to improve the situation on the ground on either side,” Slattery tells the Tehran Times in an exclusive interview. Following is the full text of the interview: Q: Donald Trump said he would be willing to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani with “no preconditions”. What are the reasons behind this decision? A: I take the president at his word. I think he would like to meet with President Rouhani. The President is looking for a solution to the pending issues with Iran. The President surely knows that Iran and the U.S. have some common concerns in the Middle East like violent Sunni extremism in the form of ISIS and el Qaeda. I am happy to hear that Pres. Trump is willing to meet with Pres. Rouhani. If Trump is willing to meet with the leader of North Korea he should be willing to meet with Pres. Rouhani. Q: After Trump's statement on no preconditions' meeting with Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CNBC hours later to set some conditions. What are the reasons for this contradiction in Washington? A: I do not know how to explain the inconsistences between the statements of Pres. Trump and Sec. of State Pompeo.   They may simply disagree but the president is in charge.   The same is true of John Bolton. Q: Former U.S. deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman tweeted “Iran just might have a precondition- (Trump) rejoin the community of nations in support of the JCPOA”. What’s your opinion on this matter? A: The President may be looking for a way to re-engage Iran and solve some of his concerns about the JCPOA and then reengage the diplomatic process.  Both sides would be wise to try and find a win-win solution to the current impasse! Further escalation of words will do nothing to improve the situation on the ground on either side.  “We should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate.”     All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
