TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian met with a number of foreign counterparts in Uzbekistan, where he headed the delegation to participate in the 4th meeting of the Conference of Afghanistan’s Neighbors. Amir Abdollahian met with Uzbek Foreign Minister Bakhtiar Saidov, Tajik counterpart Sirojiddin Muhriddin, caretaker Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Motaqqi, and Pakistani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hinna Rabbani. In his meeting with Saidov, Amir Abdollahian said high-ranking Iranian and Uzbek officials are determined to expand cooperation and that it is necessary that they use their existing possibilities to realize the wishes of the presidents of Iran and Uzbekistan. Saidov, for his part, thanked Amir Abdollahian and his entourage for accepting the invitation to attend the 4th Conference of Afghanistan’s Neighbors in the historical city of Samarkand. Amir Abdollahian and Muhriddin discussed bilateral issues and regional developments on the sidelines of the conference of Afghanistan's neighbors in Samarkand. Amir Abdollahian described the holding of the 15th session of the Iran-Tajikistan joint commission last year as a factor in further expanding ties between the two countries. Muhriddin expressed pleasure with the recent agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore their diplomatic relations. Muhriddin then spoke about cooperation between his country and Iran in different spheres and said the Tajik government is interested in expanding and boosting ties with Tehran. In his meeting with Motaqqi, Iran’s chief diplomat called the interaction between the two countries in different areas as significant. He stressed the need for establishing lasting security in Afghanistan and underlined the necessity of promoting cooperation with Afghanistan in terms of border security, avoiding tension in the area and preventing drug trafficking. Amir Abdollahian said Iran’s right to water from the Helmand River is a chronic problem and the interim ruling government in Afghanistan must, for that matter, take practical measures to resolve the existing problems. He then noted that the steps taken by Afghanistan are necessary but not sufficient, adding that the main criterion for Iran is tangible fulfillment of its right to the Helmand water, according to the Iranian foreign ministry. As for the formation of an inclusive and participatory government in Afghanistan, Amir Abdollahian said, “What we have proposed to the interested parties in Afghanistan during the last four decades is that all ethnic groups and factions should feel that Afghanistan belongs to them."  For his part, Afghanistan’s Mottaqi welcomed the issues raised by the Iranian foreign minister in the meeting. He said the interim government of Afghanistan is serious about fighting terrorism and making sure that no threat is posed to neighboring countries from inside Afghanistan. Amir Abdollahian and Rabbani also held talks over important bilateral, regional and international issues. The Iranian foreign minister stressed the need to pursue and implement agreements signed by Tehran and Islamabad.
