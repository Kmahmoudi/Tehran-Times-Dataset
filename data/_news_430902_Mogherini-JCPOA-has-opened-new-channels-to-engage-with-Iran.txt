TEHRAN – The Iran nuclear deal has created new channels for engagement with Iran, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Tuesday, addressing a meeting with members of the EU Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Consortium. “Thanks to the nuclear deal, we now have new channels to engage in a constructive manner as some recent developments in Yemen have shown with Iran to discuss regional issues and to discuss also the security matters,” Mogherini said, according to IRNA. “As the European Union, we want to definitely address Iran’s ballistic missiles and we want to address the arms proliferation in the region but to do so we need the nuclear deal to be preserved,” she remarked.
