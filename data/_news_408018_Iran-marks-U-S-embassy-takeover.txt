TEHRAN – Hundreds of thousands of Iranian students took to the streets across the country on Thursday to voice their disapproval of U.S. policies on the anniversary of the takeover of the American embassy in Tehran 37 years ago.  The day, which fell on November 3 this year, is marked in the Iranian calendar as the Student Day and National Day of Fight against Global Arrogance. 
On Wednesday, Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei hailed the day as “the day of the faithful, revolutionary, courageous, brave, and innovative young people, who barred the enemy from making any move through their measure in capturing the [US] spy den.”
The day had been named by Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Revolution, as the “second revolution.” 
Also, on the occasion, Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC)’s second-in-command, said, “The U.S. is now grappling with major crises and is no longer considered as the world’s number one power and the political will of the U.S. cannot rule in West Asia.” 
The Americans “can no longer launch a direct invasion against any country, which means that the U.S. war machine is operating without fuel,” the senior military official said while addressing demonstrators, who had gathered outside the former American embassy in Tehran.
