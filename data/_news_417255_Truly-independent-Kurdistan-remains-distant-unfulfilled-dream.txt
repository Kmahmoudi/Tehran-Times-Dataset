TEHRAN- U.S. columnist Stephen Lendman says that “A truly independent Kurdistan remains a distant unfulfilled dream.”  “I doubt regional Kurdish independence is likely any time soon. The idea has little support, other than from Israel and silently by Washington and Britain, while claiming otherwise”, Lendman tells the Tehran Times. Following is the text of the interview: Q: The Kurdish Referendum held on September 25. How will this referendum influence Kurdish movements within the region? A: It’s too early to know what will follow the results. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem offered to negotiate local autonomy to Kurds in the north of the country once terrorism is defeated. 
They may accept the idea, rather than engage in conflict with Damascus. It could also split them off from US-supported terrorists in the so called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Q: What is the reaction of the regional powers to the separation of Kurdish Regional from Iraq? A: I doubt regional Kurdish independence is likely any time soon. The idea has little support, other than from Israel and silently by Washington and Britain, while claiming otherwise. Q: What is the reaction of the international powers to the separation of Kurdish Regional from Iraq? A: Other than Israel, all other regional nations oppose Kurdish independence. They’re against partitioning Iraq. Syria is a separate story, partitioning one of the objectives of Washington and its rogue allies. Iran, of course, opposes it in both countries. Baghdad, US and EU parliamentarians rejected the referendum, saying the results won’t be recognized, expressing support for Iraqi unity and territorial integrity.
The statement cynically ignored US support for partitioning regional and other countries, Britain endorsing the same policy, Russia and China against it. Netanyahu cynically endorsed “the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to achieve their own state” - polar opposite his opposition to Palestinian self-determination.  He hopes Kurdish independence aims can help Israel divide and dominate the region, easier with smaller weaker states. Iran opposes Kurdish separatism, calling for Iraq’s territorial integrity to be preserved, days earlier suspending flights to and from the region to its territory.
The Security Council unanimously issued a statement voicing alarm over “the potentially destabilizing impact” of the plebiscite, urging “dialogue and compromise” with Baghdad. Q: After referendum, we saw intense sanctions on Arbil. According to this sanctions, do you think that Barezani will back from his decision on separation from Baghdad? A: Barzani shows no signs of backing down so far. It doesn’t mean he won’t later on.
A truly independent Kurdistan remains a distant unfulfilled dream. Iraqi Kurds have semi-autonomous status, what’s next after its referendum still uncertain.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
