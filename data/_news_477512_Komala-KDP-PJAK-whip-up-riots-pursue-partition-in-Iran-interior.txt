TEHRAN- Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi on Tuesday pointed out that the uprising in Iran was being orchestrated by foreign-supported terrorist organizations hiding in northern Iraq. The so-called Komala Party, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), and the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan, also known as PJAK, which have a history of cooperating with the Zionist regime and were once employed by the Western countries and Iraqi despot Saddam Hussein as mercenaries, are among the separatist terror groups, who are responsible for the riots. according to Vahidi.  The interior minister highlighted, “Iran’s army and law enforcement forces have firmly dealt with the rioters and their leaders and will continue to do so to neutralize their fruitless efforts.” Based on the minister’s remarks, the U.S., the Zionist regime, and separatist terror organizations are undoubtedly pleased with the riots in Iran and these crimes against the country. Komala, KDP and PJAK have been seeking separation from Iran since the early days of the Islamic Revolution. They used the death of Mahsa Amini, a native of Kurdistan, as an excuse to push ahead with their goals.
