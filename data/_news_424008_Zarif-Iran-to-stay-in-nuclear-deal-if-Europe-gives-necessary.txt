TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Saturday that Iran will stay in the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, if Europeans give the “necessary guarantees” to protect Iran’s economic interests.
 “Iran will stay in the JCPOA if its interests are met and gets necessary guarantees,” Zarif said during a meeting with members of a parliamentary faction focusing on diplomacy and national interest. On May 8, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the UN-endorsed nuclear agreement and vowed to reimpose sanctions on Iran. Zarif said that there is an “international consensus” in favor of the JCPOA which Trump cannot undermine it. After the U.S. withdrawal, Iran wants assurances from the remaining parties, especially Europeans, that its interests are guaranteed or it will resume nuclear activities with a higher speed. On Wednesday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a set of demands from Europe to save the nuclear deal. He warned that Iran would restart its nuclear activities if Europe failed to act swiftly. Ayatollah Khamenei said the JCPOA could only continue if the Europeans fulfill these conditions including: Promising not to ask Iran about its ballistic missile program or its regional activities; guaranteeing that Iran’s oil will continue to be sold; and having European banks guarantee financial transactions with Iran. ‘U.S. becoming more isolated after Pompeo speech’  Pointing to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s speech against Iran on May 21, Zarif said that Pompeo’s remarks just made the U.S. “more isolated”. In his speech at the Heritage Foundation, Pompeo demanded that Iran halt all uranium enrichment, stop its ballistic-missile program and give nuclear inspectors access to the entire country. He said that the U.S. will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic. Analysts have said demands by Pompeo are at odds with reality. NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
