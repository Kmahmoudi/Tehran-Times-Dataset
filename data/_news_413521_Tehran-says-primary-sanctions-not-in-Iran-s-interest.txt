TEHRAN – Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Tuesday that sanctions are not to any nation’s advantage as President Rouhani promised in the last presidential debate on May 12 to remove the primary sanctions against Iran if he is reelected president.
 Under the July 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and great powers only nuclear related sanctions must be removed. “Obviously, people resist against sanctions, but no sanction from any kind can serve the nation,” Nobakht told a regular news briefing. He added, “Any government’s plans should be drawn in a way to remove sanctions, not to move towards it.” In the 2013 presidential campaigns Rouhani vowed to break the “wall of sanctions” by keeping Iran’s nuclear program. The government spokesman said the president’s policy is to remove the “remaining sanctions” but this is a difficult work. In the beginning of Rouhani’s presidency in 2013 some said it would be very difficult to remove the sanction imposed on Iran for its nuclear program but capable persons such as Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif succeeded to remove sanctions against Iran through negotiations with great powers and Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh also restored Iran’s oil share in OPEC. “This issue (removal of the primary sanctions) is also among Rouhani’s plans which of course entails the support of the Leadership (Supreme Leader) and (huge) participation of people (in the Friday election) which would help the formation of a strong government to restore the rights of the nation.”  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi also told reporters on Tuesday that the campaign promise by Rouhani to remove the remaining sanctions is a “new idea” which has its own complexity. However, Qassemi said, “Nothing is impossible in diplomacy.”  “High voter turnout in elections is the backbone of any government” The government spokesman also pushed for massive participation in the May 19 presidential election, noting a large turnout would be a proof of support for the next government whose plans are in conformity with the people’s wishes.  “The plans of a democratically elected government, who earns people’s vote by majority, represent the nation’s request. So automatically the opposition will show lesser resistance to implementing the government’s future plans that have been asked by the people.” He added, “Economic growth is what’s in store for the country in the next government.” Nobakht also looked upbeat about economic prospects in the current Iranian fiscal year, which began on March 20. “We predict continued economic growth of 8 percent. As for unemployment, we expect the rate to drop to 10.4, and hopefully from there continues to decrease to a single digit.” MJG/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
