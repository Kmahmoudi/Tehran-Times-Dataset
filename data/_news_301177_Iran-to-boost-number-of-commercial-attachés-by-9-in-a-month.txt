TEHRAN- The number of Iran’s commercial attachés will be increased to 30 from its current 21 within a month, ISNA reported on Friday quoting Valiollah Afkhamirad, the head of Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization (TPO). Less than a month ago, Deputy Head of TPO Abutaleb Badri announced that his organization intends to augment the number of Iranian commercial attachés abroad, according to IRNA. “Representatives of the TPO will be forwarded for missions in the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Afghanistan and India as commercial attachés,” he said underlining that one of the government’s important programs for current year is to increase dispatching commercial attachés abroad. He also pointed out that removing problems of Iranian businessmen, creating commercial links with decision-makers and officials are the aim of the commercial attachés. An increase in the number of Iran’s commercial attachés is not unwarranted as there has been a resurgence of foreign investors and companies to seek trade avenues in the enticing market in the wake of the nuclear deal clinched between Iran and major powers.
