TEHRAN – Iran hosted on Saturday the first international conference on security, progress and sustainable development in border, land and metropolitan areas.
 Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told the conference that Iran is fully secure in spite of anti-Iran activities by some groups which are supported by certain countries in the region. “Our neighboring countries to the West and East have problems in providing security, however, we are witnessing favorable situation in [Iran’s] borders thanks to the guards who fulfill their duties,” he said. The minister noted that passive defense is the best method to protect the borders. Elsewhere, he said that Iran’s border areas are not developed well and there is “lack of balance” in all border areas. “Lack of balance comes from unbalanced distribution of resources and lack of budget planning system.”  On the sidelines of the conference, Rahmani Fazli told reporters that all the countries that share border with Iran are duty bound to provide security based on international law. He noted that Iran is ready to cooperate with countries in providing security and fighting terrorism. ‘Interaction with neighbors best tool to counter sanctions’ Addressing the forum, Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said developing ties and interaction with the neighboring countries is the best tool to counter U.S. sanctions. “If we make the borders safe and boost the economy, we can have the best tools to counter the sanctions,” the MP remarked. President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear agreement in May and reintroduced sanctions on Iran. The first batch of sanctions were enacted in August. The second wave of sanctions, which targets Iran’s oil exports and central bank, snapped back on November 4.
