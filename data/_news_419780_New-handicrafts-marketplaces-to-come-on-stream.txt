TEHRAN – A total of five newly-constructed handicrafts marketplaces are due to be inaugurated in various cities of Markazi province, central Iran. “160 direct jobs as well as 400 indirect ones will be generated by launching the marketplaces in Khomein, Shazand, Ashtian, Qurchi Bashi and Khondab,” CHTN quoted Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini, the provincial tourism chief, as saying on Tuesday. Handicrafts exports from Iran hit a record high over the first four months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-July 22, 2017) with 45.4 percent growth in comparison to the same period last year, the organization announced in September. Over the past couple of years, dozens of high-quality Iranian handicrafts have been honored with the UNESCO Seal of Excellence.
