TEHRAN – Iran’s vice presidential office for science and technology plans to develop domestic knowledge enterprises, aiming to replace imported products with similar Iranian-made ones. “We plan to encourage big knowledge enterprises to do more activities through professional meetings and making connection with guild associations,” Mahmoud Mehrdad Shokrieh, an official with the vice-presidency, announced in a press release on Thursday. “We suggest [the administration] to increase import tariffs, to encourage people to buy products which are manufactured by the Iranian knowledge enterprises,” IRNA quoted Mehrdad Shokrieh as saying. Technology and innovation incubators are also encouraged to continue their activities in the form of knowledge enterprise, he added.
