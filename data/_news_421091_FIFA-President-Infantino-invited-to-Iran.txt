TEHRAN - The Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran (FFIRI) has invited FIFA President Gianni Infantino to come to Iran on March 1. The Iranian football officials will negotiate with the FIFA President about the AFC Champions League home and away basis in the current season. The Saudi Arabian football teams will not travel to Iran to face their Iranian counterparts despite Asian Football Confederation has ordered they should not play in neutral venues. The Iranian officials are optimistic about solving the problem. Infantino will reportedly attend Tehran derby between Persepolis and Esteghlal in his two-day visit. The Iranian media reports suggest that Infantino, who will travel to Tehran via private jet, is going to meet with Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani. The Swiss-Italian will also meet Iranian Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Masoud Soltanifar. In the fifth FIFA Executive Football Summit in 2017/2018 series which was held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in January, FFIRI President Mehdi Taj invited Gianni Infantino to travel to Iran. Infantino visited Iran two years ago when he was seeking the Persian Gulf country’s support for his bid to become FIFA President.
