Rafsanjani made the remarks during a meeting with United Nations Special Representative to Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi. The Iranian nation are sympathetic to the Afghan people due to their religious and humane feelings and will support any move that helps establish stability in Afghanistan, Rafsanjani said as he pointed to the existence of millions of Afghan refugees in Iran. He stressed the role played by the United States and some regional countries in setting up the al-Qaeda and Taliban in Afghanistan and said, the United States embarked on no effective measure to settle problems of Afghanistan after the occupation of the country, IRNA reported. Despite the presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and their previous claims of fighting against drug smuggling, there is no organized effort to this effect, he added. Pointing to international pressures particularly those imposed by the United States on Iran solely because it punishes drug smugglers, the EC head said the issue shows that drug smugglers have supporters outside the country. He stressed the importance of the establishment of stability in Afghanistan for Iran as he pointed to great destruction caused by the Afghan civil wars. During the meeting, Brahimi outlined the ongoing situation in Afghanistan and said certain foreign support for the Taliban is responsible for the escalation of crises in the country. Despite ongoing efforts, no one could halt increasing trend of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan without the establishment of a powerful and stable government in that country, Brahimi said. He pointed to the efforts made by the Islamic Republic of Iran to fight drug smuggling and said, the world and even the United States know that Iran is pioneer in this regard.
