TEHRAN — Tehran will play host to the First International Conference on Numerical Weather and Climate Prediction from November 19 to 20. The event is co-organized by Iran’s Meteorological Organization (IMO), Ministry of Transport and Urban Development, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as well as Atmospheric Science & Meteorological Research Center, and Iran’s scientific society of meteorology, IMO’s website reported.  Numerical weather prediction is of particular importance for IMO, especially in weather forecasting systems aiming to increase the quality of forecast products. Due to the increasing importance and expansion of numerical weather prediction models in recent years and the extensive application of such products in natural disaster risk management, its influential role in the performance of IMO and the necessity of capacity-building and interaction with international researchers, the IMO will hold the First International Conference on Numerical Weather and Climate Prediction. Atmospheric-Oceanic modeling at different scales, data assimilation, probabilistic forecasting and ensemble forecasting systems, verification of the output of the forecasting models, and application of the numerical weather and climate forecasting products in atmospheric-oceanic hazards are the topics of the specialized conference. The objectives of the conference are to understand and make decisions about general methods of development and application of numerical weather prediction models over Iran and to come into contact with the latest hardware and software technologies used in numerical prediction methods at national and international levels.  According to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data are the form of weather model data we are most familiar with on a day-to-day basis.  NWP focuses on taking current observations of weather and processing these data with computer models to forecast the future state of weather. Knowing the current state of the weather is just as important as the numerical computer models processing the data.  Current weather observations serve as input to the numerical computer models through a process known as data assimilation to produce outputs of temperature, precipitation, and hundreds of other meteorological elements from the oceans to the top of the atmosphere.
