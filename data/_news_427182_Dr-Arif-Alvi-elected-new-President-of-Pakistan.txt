TEHRAN - Less than a fortnight after Imran Khan took over as the new Prime Minister of Pakistan, senior Pakistan Tehreek Insaaf (PTI) leader Dr. Arif Alvi was elected as the country’s new President on Tuesday. Dr. Alvi, the candidate of PTI, was contesting against joint opposition candidate Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) candidate Aitzaz Ahsan. A statement issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) said Dr. received 353 electoral votes, while his rivals Fazlur Rehman received 185 and Aitzaz Ahsan received 124. Speaking to media persons in Islamabad, the 13th President of Pakistan said he was thankful to Almighty Allah for emerging triumphant in the election process. He also thanked PTI chairman and PM Imran Khan for reposing confidence in him. “I have nothing in this, my affiliates made me contest the election,” the newly-elected president said, expressing gratitude to all those who voted for him. Dr. Alvi vowed to work in capacity as President. “I am not just a president of Tehreek-e-Insaf, rather of all political parties and the nation,” he stressed. He is expected to take oath of office on September 9. PTI won the general election in Pakistan last month but failed to gain the clear majority. After cobbling together an alliance with smaller parties, a new government was formed a few weeks ago with cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan as premier.
