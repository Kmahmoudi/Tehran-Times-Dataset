TEHRAN – Mohsen Rezaee, secretary of Iran’s Expediency Council, said on Saturday that the United States is seeking to prop up Kurdish forces against Turkey, adding that Ankara in return is trying to disrupt U.S. plans. “Regional confrontations will yield no positive results for any countries involved,” Rezaei was quoted by Mehr as saying.  “It would be better if everyone made efforts so that legitimate governments could establish sustainable peace in their countries.” He further said that the U.S. and Turkey’s confrontation will bring about no positive outcome for the two sides.
