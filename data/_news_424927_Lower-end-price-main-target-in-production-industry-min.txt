“Our main target in the field of production is reducing the end price of products in the current year, which is the year of Support for Iranian Products”, Iranian Industry, Mining and Trade Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari announced in a press conference on Saturday. Improving the quality of products is also of great importance in this due, the minister added. Value-added tax and production taxes should be removed, he said, adding that funding the projects is also one of the main factors affecting the end price as some production units cannot use their working capital. “We can allocate subsidy from the general budget to the loans interest rates and end price will be reduced in this way”, he noted. Despite the pressure from outside the country, Iranian people’s strong will for working and production has led to 22.2-percent rise in demand for establishment of industrial units during the two-month period from March 21 to May 21 compared to the figure of the same period of time in the past year, Shariatmadari highlighted and also predicted a 44.9-percent growth in investment making. The minister said that 7.9-percent increase in the number of electricity subscribers in the industrial sector indicates increase in production of industrial units. He further mentioned ten special industrial-production projects that their implementation is being seriously followed up as developing trade transport fleet, building vessels for developing sea transport, developing garment industry, supporting Iranian products, supporting production chain, strengthening production and stable employment, developing cooperation with Asian and neighboring countries, making small mines active, and completing base metals production chain. Implementation of these ten special projects is in line with promoting production factors, improving business environment, boosting investment making in production units, supporting non-oil exports, managing trade balance, etc. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
