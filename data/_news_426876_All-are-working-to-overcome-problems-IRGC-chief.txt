TEHRAN - Chief of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps Mohammad said on Sunday that threatening Iran to military war will just harm the enemies.
 “Enemies make efforts to cause disappointment among the people and marginalize the revolution, because based on previous experiences, they are aware that they cannot achieve their objectives through war and military attack,” he said during a speech at Razi University in Kermanshah. He added, “The Iranian nation has stood up for the Revolution’s causes in spite of the enemy’s plots.” He described the current situation in the country as “complicated” and “sensitive” and said all officials and state bodies are making efforts to find a way to get past this situation. In early August U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order reimposing sanctions against Iran. The second batch sanctions will be snapped back on November 4. The re-imposition of sanctions came after withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on May 8. Back in May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Washington will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic. Iranian officials have said the U.S. actions equal an “economic war” on the country. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
