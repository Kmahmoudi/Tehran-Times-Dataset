TEHRAN – EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has said that the EU will stand by the Iran nuclear agreement, describing the deal as a “milestone” belonging to the entire international community.
 In her annual briefing to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, Mogherini said the agreement could set a precedent for resolving global issues through diplomacy. “The nuclear deal with Iran shows the way forward to us, the Europeans. It set a milestone for non-proliferation,” she said. The nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was inked between Iran and six world powers in July 2015 and took effect in January 2016. Under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to limit some aspects of its nuclear activities in exchange for the removal of all nuclear-related sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic. Underlining the need for all sides to comply with the JCPOA, Mogherini said, “World powers negotiated the deal, but the agreement was immediately ratified by the Security Council and the deal now belongs to the entire international community – not only to us who were in that room in Vienna.” Backed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and European leaders, Mogherini has numerously voiced strong support for the accord, especially as a response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s rhetoric. As a presidential candidate, Trump repeatedly pledged to undo “the worst deal ever” with Iran that was negotiated and signed under the Obama administration. He recently hurled accusations against the Islamic Republic, saying Iran is not living up to the “spirit” of the nuclear agreement.  This is while the IAEA, in numerous reports, has confirmed Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA. Iranian officials has also tried to reassure the world that Tehran will stay committed to the deal, while strongly criticizing Washington’s shortcomings in easing anti-Iran economic sanctions. “Mr. Trump is creating a climate of tension. If he creates problems, Iran has the means to make him regret it,” Iranian Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said in an interview with AFP. Trump's threats have scared off global banks and investors, Jahangiri said, urging the other parties to the JCPOA in Europe, Russia and China to take measures to reinforce the deal.
