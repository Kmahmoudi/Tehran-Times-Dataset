The participation of a large number of foreign dignitaries in President Hassan Rouhani’s swearing-in ceremony signifies the paramount importance of Iran and indicates positive feedback on Iran’s foreign policy tenets.  By participation in the ceremony, the international community is vocally declaring its support more than anything else for the July 2015 nuclear agreement which President Rouhani and his diplomatic team struck with the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The participation of Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in the ceremony is highly significant as it clearly sends this message to the extremist U.S. President Donald Trump that the 28-nation European bloc is adamant in backing the hard-won nuclear agreement which has also been endorsed by the UN Security Council. The world is noticing that the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency is confirming one after another that Iran is abiding by its commitments under the nuclear agreement, meaning that any excuse by Trump to abrogate the deal is just nonsensical, irrational, and adventurous.  Trump, which according to Foreign Policy, has instructed a group of White House staffers to invent a pretext for withholding certification of Iran’s compliance at the next 90-day review of the deal must now find himself more isolated than before.  This show of support for Iran is indicative of the fact that the world has woken up to the threats by Trump whom Germany’s Martin Schulz has described as a “risk to the whole world”. Trump may have been emboldened by his exit from the Paris climate agreement which is not mandatory. Yet, he must get the message that he will face the rage of the Iranian people and a strong resistance by the international community if he abrogates the multilateral nuclear deal. He also should bear in mind that any effort to put out of the multilateral deal have more immense consequences for the United Nations and its bodies.
