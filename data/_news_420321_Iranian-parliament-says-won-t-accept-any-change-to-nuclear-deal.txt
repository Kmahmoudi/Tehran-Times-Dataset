TEHRAN – The Iranian parliament will not accept changes to the 2015 nuclear deal and considers any change equal to complete collapse of the agreement, its speaker Ali Larijani announced on Sunday. 
 Talking in open session of the parliament, Larijani called on the U.S. to stop thinking about making changes to the multilateral nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump extended waivers of key economic sanctions on Iran for another 120 days, but said he would scrap the agreement unless European countries “join with the United States in fixing (what he called) significant flaws in the deal” during this time. Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, said in September that should the deal collapse, Tehran would be “walking away with better technology” as it had continued its research and development and improved its technological base in the meantime.  NA/PA
