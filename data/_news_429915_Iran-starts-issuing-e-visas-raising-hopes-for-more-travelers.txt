TEHRAN – Iran has started issuing electronic visas for those traveling to the country, in a bid to facilitate tourist inflow and to cope with sanctions recently reimposed by the U.S. Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization Director Ali-Asghar Mounesan said the scheme took effect from November 22 to fulfill an arrangement between the Foreign Ministry and the Law Enforcement Force. The electronic visas would be issued without any entry or exit stamp affixed on them, said Mojtaba Karimi who presides over Foreign Ministry’s Visa and Passport Department, Press TV reported. There is no difference between electronic and normal visas in terms of duration as the new approach provides foreign tourists with a chance to visit the country without any concern. Some six million foreign travelers visited Iran in the first half of the current Iranian calendar year (started March 21), which shows 51 percent year-on-year growth, according to data compiled by the CHHTO. A couple of months ago, Washington announced those travelers who would visit certain countries including Iran would face restrictions to enter the U.S. Filled from corner to corner with ancient bazaars, museums, mosques, monuments, gardens, historical sites, rich natural and rural landscapes, Iran hosts some of the world’s oldest cultural monuments, including 22 UNESCO World Heritage sites.
