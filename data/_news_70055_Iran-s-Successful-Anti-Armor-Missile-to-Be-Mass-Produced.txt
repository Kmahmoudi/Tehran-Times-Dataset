The statement added that the experts of the Iranian Aerospace Industry, affiliated to the Defense Ministry have made the missile, and that the missile was tested in two phases and was very exact in hitting the targets. According to the statement the missile is scheduled to be mass-produced in Iran to meet the needs of the Iranian army. Each of the locally-produced missiles can annually save Iran $500 million in foreign currency, the statement said, adding that production of such missiles proves Iran's ceaseless efforts made by the Aerospace Industry experts to embark on the ambitious arms program, IRNA reported. Prior to this on May, Iran tested a domestically made solidified missile. The surface-to-surface rocket can be guided to destroy targets with high accuracy. As part of efforts to achieve military self-sufficiency, Iranian experts at the Army Headquarters planned and produced the Fateh (victorious). Iran military had earlier announced a comprehensive campaign to produce and promote the manufacture of conventional arms for defensive uses in a bid to counter crippling sanctions imposed in the aftermath of the 1980-1988 Iraqi-imposed war. thr 032 iran-missile /pol/ iran test-fires anti-armor missile (adds more in para 5,6,7) tehran, july 31, irna -- the iranian weapons program, in a bold move that will surely alarm the united states and israel, successfully test-fired an anti-armor missile capable of destroying the most sophisticated armored equipment, the defense ministry announced tuesday. "the saeqeh-1 (lightning) missile enjoys a high infiltration capability and can destroy the most sophisticated armored equipment in the world," it said in a statement faxed to irna. it said the missile is a product of the experts of the iranian aerospace industry which is affiliated to the defense ministry. "the missile, tested in two phases, is very precise in hitting targets, thanks to its range and operational capability in different geographical positions," it said. the statement added that the missiles are to be mass-produced in the country to meet the needs of the iranian army. "each of locally-produced missile can save iran 500 million dollars annually in foreign currency," it said. "production of such missiles is proof of iran's ceaseless efforts made by the aerospace industry experts to embark on an ambitious arms program," the statement noted. in may this year iran also successfully test-fired a domestically made solid-fueled missile. the surface-to-surface rocket can be guided to destroy targets with high accuracy. the fateh (victorious) 110 was planned and produced totally by iranian experts at its army headquarters as part of efforts to achieve military self-sufficiency. the military has earlier announced a comprehensive campaign to produce and promote the manufacture of conventional arms for defensive uses in a bid to counter crippling sanctions imposed in the aftermath of the 1980-1988 iraqi-imposed war. the united states and the zionist regime have voiced concern over iran's success in domestically producing arms in an effort to divert world attention from the real threats posed by the israeli regime which has one of the world's largest nuclear arsenal. the campaign began last year when iran test-fired a version of its shahab-3 missile with a range of 1,300 km (800 miles). the u.s. has also tried to drum up efforts against the threat of the islamic republic selling more arms to regional countries. iran has claimed big strides in the development of its domestic defense industry. it has produced a new transport plane, a combat helicopter, a submarine and a guided-missile warship.
