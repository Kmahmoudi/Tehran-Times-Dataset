TEHRAN – Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi cautioned on Monday that Tehran might reconsider cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog if the United States fails to respect its commitments under the nuclear agreement. Talking to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director Yukiya Amano on the phone, Salehi said in case Washington falls short of its obligations, Iran will adopt measures that can affect its cooperation with the UN body, IRNA reported.  Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany and the European Union signed the nuclear deal, also called the JCPOA, back in 2015.
