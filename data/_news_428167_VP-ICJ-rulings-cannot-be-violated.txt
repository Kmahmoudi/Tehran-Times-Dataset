TEHRAN – The vice president for legal affairs on Wednesday dismissed doubts on whether the International Court of Justice’s ruling on Iran’s lawsuit against the U.S. would be enforced. Speaking to reporters after a cabinet session, La'ya Joneidi hailed the top UN court’s ruling that the U.S. should ensure that sanctions against Iran do not impact humanitarian aid or civil aviation safety, Tasnim reported. “If we say that the rulings handed down by this court have no guarantee to be implemented, then we should conclude that the international law is worthless,” she remarked.
