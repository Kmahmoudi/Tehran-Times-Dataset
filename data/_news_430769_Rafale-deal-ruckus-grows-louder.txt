TEHRAN - The political wrangling between India’s two biggest parties – Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress – is intensifying over Rafale deal controversy. The Congress has alleged that the BJP-led government misled the Supreme Court over the Rafale deal and committed contempt of court and perjury. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the basis of the court ruling was a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which has not been seen by anyone, nor has it been shared with Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC). “The BJP has hoodwinked the nation and cheated the people. Now it has the guts to do the same to mislead the apex court. There is serious misrepresentation of vital, significant facts to the apex court. This amounts to contempt (of court), (breach of) privilege as well as perjury,” he claimed. In relief to the Modi government, the Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the pleas challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 Rafale jets, saying there was no occasion to "really doubt the decision making process" warranting setting aside of the contract. Rafale deal controversy is a political controversy in India related to the purchase of 36 multirole fighter aircraft for a price estimated to be worth Rs 58,000 crore by India’ defense ministry. Congress has alleged that the procurement procedures were bypassed in acquisition of Rafale. The issue has since been a topic of discussion in India’s political and intelligentsia circles.
