TEHRAN – Behrooz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), announced on Tuesday that Iran will export less heavy water due to an oversupply in the international market. Therefore, Kamalvandi said, from now on Iran will export some 20 tons of heavy water per year.  “Within the span of 7 months, we sold 70 tons of heavy water. We are set to sell 20 tons annually,” he stated. Kamalvandi also said Iran is now in a better condition to achieve industrialization of its nuclear fuel cycle as the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers has gone into effect. Elsewhere in his remarks, Kamalvandi said the implementation of the nuclear deal has led to the expansion of Iran’s ties with other countries that, in turn, created various economic opportunities for the country.
