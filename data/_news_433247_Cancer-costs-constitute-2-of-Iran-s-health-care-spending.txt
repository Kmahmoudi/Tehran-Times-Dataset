TEHRAN — Cancer medical costs are even higher than cardiovascular diseases as they constitute 2% of the country’s health care spending, deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi has said. 
 He made the remarks during the opening ceremony of the 14th International Congress on Breast Cancer on Thursday, IRNA news agency reported.  It is projected that within the next 10 years cancer will rise 115 percent in the country, so by taking timely measures the increase should be controlled, Harirchi highlighted.  The growth of the aging population in the country is the main reason behind the increase, he said, adding that, currently cancer is the second leading cause of death in the country.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer, World Health Organization (WHO) highlights.  Approximately 70% of deaths from cancer occur in low- and middle-income countries. The economic impact of cancer is significant and is increasing. The total annual economic cost of cancer in 2010 was estimated at approximately $1.16 trillion.
