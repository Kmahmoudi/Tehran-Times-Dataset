TEHRAN— Iran has criticized the clear contrast visible in the U.S. officials’ remarks, stating that the foe’s hypocrisy has no end. Writing on his Twitter account on Wednesday, Nasser Kanaani, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, addressed the clear contrast between the statements of Western officials about Iran. “It is a shameful contrast that the official spokesmen and high-ranking officials of the government who declared and applied the policy of ‘maximum pressure’ and ‘devastating and crushing sanctions’ to bring the Iranian people to their knees are now talking about ‘empathy’ and ‘support’ of the Iranian people!” He continued, “It's even more contradictory that their media encourage street conflicts, destruction and rioting and incites ethnic motives, but chant the slogan of ‘life’ for the people of Iran!” In conclusion, the diplomat opined that the hypocrisy of the main enemy of the Iranian nation “has no end!” Similarly on Monday, Kanaani advised the Western officials to end the cruel bans on the Iranian nation. Writing on his Instagram page, the diplomat stated, “American and European political leaders, their news agencies, and Persian-language media outlets supported by the West have exploited the tragic incident of the death of a young woman and backed rioters and disruptors of the country’s national security under the motto of supporting the rights of the Iranian nation.” Kanaani added, “They left no stone unturned in this regard. However, they either took no notice of or belittled the presence of millions of people on the streets and squares of the country in support of the establishment and their country and in strong opposition to chaos.” The spokesman went on to say that the U.S. and some of its European allies have always adopted hypocritical and double standard approaches toward Iran, citing decades-long “inhumane sanctions” against the Iranian as an example. “It is better for those who claim to be advocating the rights of the Iranian nation to give up their bogus slogans and put an end to several decades of cruel and inhumane sanctions against the Iranian nation,” Kanaani stated. Protests have erupted in several Iranian cities over the death of Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman from Saqez. She died in a hospital on September 16 three days after collapsing at a police station in the capital Tehran. She and others had been detained by morality police to receive training on dress code rules. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
