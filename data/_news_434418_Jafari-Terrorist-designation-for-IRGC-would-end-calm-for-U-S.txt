TEHRAN – The U.S. military will no longer have calm in West Asia if the United States designates the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, IRGC Chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday. “If the Americans do this stupid thing, threatening our national security, according to the policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran we will put reciprocal measures on the agenda,” Mehr quoted Jafari as saying. The Trump administration is expected to designate the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization as early as next week, CNN on Sunday quoted a U.S. official as saying.
