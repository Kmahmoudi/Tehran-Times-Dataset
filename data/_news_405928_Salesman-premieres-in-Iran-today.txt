TEHRAN – Asghar Farhadi’s acclaimed drama “The Salesman” is having its countrywide premiere today.
 Members of the movie’s cast and crew are scheduled to attend the initial screening at Tehran’s Kurosh Cineplex. The movie is about Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidusti) who move into a new flat in the center of Tehran. An incident linked to the previous tenant dramatically changes the young couple’s life. “The Salesman” scooped the awards for best screenplay, written by Farhadi, and the Palme d’Or for best actor, won by Shahab Hosseini, at the 69th Cannes Film Festival. Tickets for the first week of screenings at some of Tehran’s theaters have already been sold out. Photo: Taraneh Alidusti acts in a scene from “The Salesman”.
