TEHRAN – Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said on Tuesday the recent terrorist attack in the southeastern port city of Chabahar was aimed to undermine Iran’s economy, Tasnim reported. Chabahar is intended to turn into regional trade hub, rivaling port Gwadar, China’s main trade route to Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. On December 6, a vehicle laden with explosives went off close to a police headquarters in the city. Two soldiers were killed and at least 43 individuals were injured during the attack. Alavi also said Iranian security forces have foiled many terrorist attacks in recent years, adding, “No country in the world has such a successful intelligence service as the Islamic Iran.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
