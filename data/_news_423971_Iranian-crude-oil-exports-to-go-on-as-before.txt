TEHRAN- Iran is continuing its exports of oil as it did before Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal, and exports 2.5 million barrels of the product per day, National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) Managing Director Ali Kardor announced. “The U.S. does not play a role in exports of Iranian crude and in case Europeans fulfill their commitments about supporting oil export requirements including tankers, transportation, money transfer and insurance as well as Iran’s nuclear deal, Iran will face no difficulties with crude oil exports and can preserve its exports level,” Kardor was quoted by IRIB as saying on Saturday.
