TEHRAN – On Wednesday the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said Daesh would be wiped out in two months.

 The IRGC has been providing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s army with military advisory missions over the past years when the Arab country was invaded by Daesh and other terrorist groups. Jafari’s remarks were the exact words spoken a few days earlier by Qassemi Soleimani, commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force which has led advisory missions against Daesh, including in Iraq. Iran officially voiced its intention to fight Daesh with new force in July when members of the terrorist group attacked the Majlis building and Imam Khomeini’s mausoleum, killing 17. A few days later, the IRGC launched missiles onto Daesh positions in Syria, inflicting heavy damages on the terrorists in retaliation for the terrorist attack. In the latest military development, IRGC drones destroyed several Daesh bases on the Syrian border with Iraq. According to an IRINN TV report on Sunday, during the IRGC operations carried out in Syria’s eastern Dayr al-Zawr province, many terrorists were killed in the attacks, which also destroyed large amounts of terrorists' equipment and weapons.
