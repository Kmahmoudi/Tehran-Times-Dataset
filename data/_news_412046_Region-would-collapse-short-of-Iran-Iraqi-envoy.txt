TEHRAN - Iraqi ambassador to Tehran Rajeh Saber Abboud al-Mousavi stressed in comments on Thursday that the whole region would fall without backing from Iran. “Were in not for Iran, the region would fall,” the envoy was quoted as saying, according to IRNA. “The Islamic Republic of Iran is the flag bearer of the Islamic unity and fights against regional enemies and their plots,” he added. Iran was the first country who rushed to help Iraq after the country was caught off guard in 2014 as ISIS terrorists ravaged through the country, seizing vast areas of the country. Last week, Iraqi prime minister’s military advisor Khaled Hamoud hailed Iran’s positive role in fighting terrorism in Iraq, saying, “Iran’s arms and ammunition have been very effective for us in fighting Daesh (ISIS),” the Iraqi official was quoted as saying on the sidelines of a recent international exhibition of military and defense industry in Baghdad. Hamoud underlined the need for Iran and Iraq to continue cooperation in the fight against terrorists. The two sides have been fighting terrorism to establish security in the region, he noted.
