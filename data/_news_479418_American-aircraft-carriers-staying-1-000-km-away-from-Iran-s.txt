TEHRAN – Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri said on Sunday that Iran has gained such great military and deterrent power that the American forces have to stay far from the Iranian coasts. No American aircraft carrier has been deployed to the Persian Gulf during the past two years, staying over 1,000 kilometers away from the coasts of Iran, Major General Bagheri told an administrative meeting in the southern port city of Bushehr, Tasnim reported. The commander said the U.S. has admitted that Iran’s success in extending the range of its missiles and boosting the accuracy and power of its fire has increased the costs and risks of American forces staying in the region. The military chief added the Iranian Armed Forces constantly monitor the enemies’ moves across the region. The general also stated that the enemy’s decision to give up plans for a military attack on Iran has nothing to do with its fake concern for human rights, but relates to its fear of war and Iran’s massive deterrent power. Brigadier General Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force, said last month that “Iran is now a world pioneer in the field of drones and that its accomplishments have posed a challenge to the movements that the big and mighty militaries of the world had begun decades earlier.” In remarks in November 2021, IRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami ruled out the possibility of a war against Iran, saying the enemy has become disappointed with military action on the Islamic Republic. Military war on Iran has been dropped off the enemy’s list of options, the commander said, adding that the adversaries have instead targeted the Iranian people, their religion and their livelihood.
