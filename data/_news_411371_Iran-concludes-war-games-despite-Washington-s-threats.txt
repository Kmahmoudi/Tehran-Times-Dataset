TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) on Wednesday finished a three-day military exercise that was launched in Dasht-e Kavir, central Iran, Tasnim news agency reported. The drills were launched despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatening remarks late last month, when he said Iran “was playing with fire” and all U.S. options were on the table. Commander of IRGC Ground Force Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour told reporters on Wednesday that the drills were intended to send a message to “global arrogant powers”. Codenamed “Payambar-e Azam 11 (The Great Prophet)”, the military exercise was launched on Monday under the motto of “Presentation of Power and Sustainable Security” to boast the country’s military might with rockets, artillery, tanks and helicopters. With the war game, Pakpour said, Iran wants to convey a message and warn the global hegemonic powers about the repercussions of any possible “foolish” action against the Islamic Republic. The final stage of the maneuvers took place in Tayband County of Khorasan Razavi Province, where the IRGC’s forces attacked mock enemy positions and vehicles. State-of-the-art and precision-guided projectiles were launched at designated targets during the last day of the war games. The IRGC’s T-72 tank units, Boraq personnel carriers and BMP-2 armored vehicles were also showcased. Pakpour also said the drills demonstrated only a fraction of the country’s defense capabilities, adding that armed forces are fully prepared to defend the country’s land if the hegemonic powers dare to attack.
