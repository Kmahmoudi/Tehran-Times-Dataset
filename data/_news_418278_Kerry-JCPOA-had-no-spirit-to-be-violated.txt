TEHRAN – Former U.S. secretary of state John Kerry has condemned President Donald Trump’s decision to decertify the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, stressing that the agreement is working as expected.

 “Important to note the simple things - the Iran nuclear deal is working, doing precisely what it was set up to do,” Kerry told a gathering at Britain’s Royal Institute of International Affairs, commonly known as Chatham House on Monday. He added, “I heard the U.S. president say there’s a violation of the spirit of the Iran deal - There was no spirit of the deal.” On October 13, Trump in a major confrontational stance against the Islamic Republic of Iran refused to certify the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “The Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement…,” Trump claimed then. Addressing these remarks, Kerry said, “The violation idea has been pulled out of the sky. There is no science, no evidence that would merit decertification.” “China and Russia played significant roles in JCPOA, a truly global effort; we need more of that not less.” the former U.S. secretary of state said. The 159-page nuclear agreement between Iran and the 5+1 group (Russia, China, the U.S., Britain, France, and Germany) was reached in July 2015 and came into force in January 2016. Since the historic deal was reached, the International Atomic Energy Agency has in eight reports confirmed the Islamic Republic’s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA.
