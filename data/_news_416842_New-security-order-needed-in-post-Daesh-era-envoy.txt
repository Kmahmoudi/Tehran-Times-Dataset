TEHRAN – The Iranian Ambassador to Beirut, Mohammad Fathali, said on Saturday that the region needs a new security order in the post-Daesh era. In an interview with IRNA, Fathali pointed to the big challenges in the post-Daesh era, saying, “Inevitably (regional) countries will have to change their approach and accept the realities on the ground.” Even the state sponsors of terrorist groups now realize that their policies have been wrong and their chickens will someday come home to roost, the ambassador added.
