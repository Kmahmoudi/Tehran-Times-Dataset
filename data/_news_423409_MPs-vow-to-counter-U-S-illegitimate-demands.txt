TEHRAN – A number of Iranian lawmakers in a letter to Leader of the Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have said that they will not let the U.S. impose its “illegitimate demands” on Iran. The MPs emphasized that the nuclear deal was aimed at lifting sanctions and benefiting Iran’s economy, neither of which has been fulfilled despite Iran’s full compliance to the deal, Mehr reported. According to the lawmakers, the United States has done all it could to deprive Iran from the benefits of the deal.  They also called on the Iranian government to vigorously retaliate against the enemies’ actions.
