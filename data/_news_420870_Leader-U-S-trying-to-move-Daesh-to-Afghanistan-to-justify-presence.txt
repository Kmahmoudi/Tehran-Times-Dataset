TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that the U.S. is trying to justify its presence in the region by relocating Daesh from Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan. “They were defeated, previously, in Iraq and Syria. Now, they seek to ignite terror all over again in Afghanistan,” the Leader said, according to khamenei.ir. The remarks by the Leader comes as Daesh has committed a number of unspeakable terrorist attacks in Afghanistan. The most recent one happened on Monday when Daesh militants attacked Afghan soldiers guarding a military academy in Kabul, killing at least 11 troops and wounding 16.
 
Speaking to his theology students, the Leader said, “The U.S. seeks to inflict interior conflicts on countries of the region, to prevent them from opposing the impudent agent of arrogance: Zionism.” Ayatollah Khamenei went on to say, “This represents one purpose for the U.S.; its other purpose is to justify its presence. When there is unrest in Afghanistan, the U.S. justifies its presence by saying they want to establish ‘peace and security’. “However, they themselves caused the unrest. The incidents in Afghanistan were all caused by the U.S., either by use of a mediator or directly, over 20 years ago. That is, the U.S. is the main cause for massacres and murders in the region, using the pretext of religion… God’s curse be upon the arrogant powers, their agents, as well as the vicious Zionist regime and the U.S. for destroying Muslims in such a horrendous manner.” The Leader also warned that the hands which created Daesh, either in Iraq or in Syria, and committed all those crimes through Daesh, using Daesh as a means to carry out attacks against entire populations, are the same hands now transferring Daesh to Afghanistan.
