TEHRAN – Professor Nader Entessar from South Alabama University says “all indications point out to Trump not certifying Iran compliance with the JCPOA.”  “Of course, this will signal the last nail in the JCPOA's coffin,” Entessar tells the Tehran Times. 
He also says that “Those in Iran who are counting on Europe as a counterweight to the United States are either daydreaming or simply grasping for straws.” 
Following is the text of the interview: Q: Some sources in the West have announced that Donald Trump will declare non-commitment of Iran to JCPOA probably. What’s your opinion? all indications point out to Trump not certifying Iran compliance with the JCPOA.  Of course, this will signal the last nail in the JCPOA's coffin. A: Trying to predict what Donald Trump will or will not do is an exercise in futility.   But all indications point out to Trump not certifying Iran compliance with the JCPOA.  Of course, this will signal the last nail in the JCPOA's coffin. Q: If Trump violates JCPOA, what will be the next step against Iran? A: I think the next step will be to convince and/or threaten other countries to follow Washington's lead in reimposing further sanctions against Iran and thus ratcheting up the economic warfare against Tehran.   Politically, the "regime change" mantra and moves to destabilize Iran will once again define Washington's primary approach towards Tehran.   Q: The U.S. Congress has to vote for turning sanctions against Iran back if Trump decides to violate JCPOA. Will U.S. Congress take such decision in companionship with him? A: Most likely yes.  U.S. Congress has always been the linchpin of anti-Iran activities, and it will continue to act in that fashion for the foreseeable future.  Of course, U.S. Congress has always been the linchpin of anti-Iran activities, and it will continue to act in that fashion for the foreseeable future.   Congress may couch its sanctions to give the impression that sanctions are for a variety of reasons other than the JCPOA, but they will be sanctions nonetheless.  Iran is one issue that unifies Trump and his opponents in the U.S. government. Q: Some persons like Richard Goldberg believe that EU will accompany Trump if U.S. president decides to violate JCPOA. What’s your idea?
A: Europe may huff and puff, but at the end, it will have no choice but to follow Washington's lead on Iran.  The United States is simply too important for Europe, and it cannot afford to alienate Washington, especially when it comes to Iran.  Those in Iran who are counting on Europe as a counterweight to the United States are either daydreaming or simply grasping for straws.
