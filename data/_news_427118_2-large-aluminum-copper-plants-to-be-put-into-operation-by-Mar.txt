TEHRAN- Head of Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization (IMIDRO) announced that two large plants for production of aluminum and copper will be put into operation in the country by the end of current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019). Mehdi Karbasian also said that the 300,000-ton capacity aluminum plant in the south of the country will be the largest and most modern aluminum production plant in Iran, IMIDRO Public Relations Department reported. This plant will need aluminum oxide and aluminum powder to be imported from other countries because there is not enough raw material in Iran, he mentioned.
