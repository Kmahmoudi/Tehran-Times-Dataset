TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday that backing down in the face of the U.S. bullying will make it more “pushy” and “brazen”, noting realities and experiences show that the U.S. remains the main enemy of Iran.
 “Backing down against the Americans will make them pushy and brazen; therefore, the only way is confrontation and resistance,” Leader told a large number of students ahead of November 4, the day marking the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979. The Leader strongly urged the students not to ignore the main enemy, namely the U.S., saying, “This is the main condition for the continuation of the auspicious path of the country’s future.” The U.S. is in the true sense of word the evil and main enemy and this reality is not based on prejudice and a cynical look, but rather emanates from experience, proper comprehension of issues and seeing the realities on the ground,” “The U.S. is in the true sense of word the evil and main enemy and this reality is not based on prejudice and a cynical look, but rather emanates from experience, proper comprehension of issues and seeing the realities on the ground,” leader.ir quoted Ayatollah Khamenei as saying.   Leader of the Islamic Revolution also slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s “foolish” remarks against Iranian people, saying such a stance is a clear sign of Washington’s hostility towards the entire nation. “As you witnessed recently, the head of U.S. administration said the Iranian nation is a ‘terrorist nation.’ You see how foolish this attitude is? He calls a nation terrorist. He does not say the leader is terrorist; he does not say the government is terrorist; he says the Iranian nation is terrorist,” Ayatollah Khamenei said.
“Is it not hostility?” the Leader asked. “This foolish comment indicates that not only are the Americans the enemies of the Iranian leadership and government, they also show hostility and enmity towards the very existence of a nation that stands against them tirelessly,” he added, according to Press TV.
 
Leader also criticized those who believe that “we should slightly back down against the U.S. for its hostilities to ease,” noting, “Historical experiences, including the case of Dr. Mosaddegh (an Iranian prime minister whose democratically-elected government was overthrown through a U.S.-led coup in 1953)  prove that Americans show no mercy even toward those who have pinned their hopes on them.” Ayatollah Khamenei said the Americans’ repeated mistakes and miscalculations stem from their deep animosity towards the Iranian nation
Touching on Washington’s threats to quit the 2015 nuclear deal, the Leader said, “Now they are taking extremely mischievous actions to sabotage the results of the nuclear negotiations, namely the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).” He went on to say that the enmities of global bullies have so far had no effect and they have not been able to do a damn thing. The Leader also advised students that they should counter plots of the enemy in order to realize the ideals of the Islamic Republic. “My beloved children, you are the generation that will be able to take this country to the highest point and fulfill the nation’s Islamic ideals and great wishes by overcoming the ploys of the enemy and surmounting the obstacles and hardships; however, the realization of this objectives has a number of conditions.”
