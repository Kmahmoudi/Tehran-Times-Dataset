TEHRAN- Polls have officially closed in Turkey’s elections as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan faces the biggest political challenge of his two-decade rule. His main rival is opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu. More than 64 million people are eligible to vote to elect a president and parliament for a five-year term. The polls opened at 8 am (05:00 GMT) and closed at 5 pm (14:00 GMT). Turkey’s opposition says that the vote turnout at Sunday’s presidential and parliamentary polls in that country exceeded 93% "According to first data we have received, the voter turnout was 93.6%, a record-breaking figure," a source in the opposition told TASS. If no candidate secures more than half the votes in the first round of voting, a May 28 run-off will be held.
