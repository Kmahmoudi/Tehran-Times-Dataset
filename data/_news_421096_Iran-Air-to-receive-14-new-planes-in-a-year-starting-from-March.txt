TEHRAN- Iran’s flag carrier Iran Air will add at least 14 new airplanes to its fleet in the next Iranian calendar year (which starts on March 21), according to the company’s CEO. Farzaneh Sharafbafi added that no new airplane will join Iran Air fleet by the end of current year, IRNA reported on Wednesday. The implementation of the nuclear deal in January 2016 led to the removal of sanctions against Iran, allowing the country to purchase hundreds of commercial aircraft from Airbus, Boeing and a number of other companies. Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi announced in mid-January 2016 that renovation of Iran Air fleet has begun, adding that according to the contracts with world major plane makers, Iran Air is to receive 200 new planes, of which 100 will be purchased from Airbus and 80 from Boeing. The first, second and third planes that Iran purchased from the European aviation giant Airbus landed in Tehran on January 12, March 11, and March 25, 2017, respectively. Also, Iran Air has already received six of its ordered 20 turboprop passenger planes purchased from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR.
