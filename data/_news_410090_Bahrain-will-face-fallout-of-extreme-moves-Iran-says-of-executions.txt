TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry strongly condemned on Sunday the execution of three political activists in Bahrain, saying the country will see the consequences of its “extremist actions” 
 “Once again, the Bahraini government showed that it is not after peaceful solution and a way out of the crisis by taking this inconsiderate action,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi remarked. He added, “Lack of transparency in the procedure of unfair trial of these citizens has been approved by the international circles and all the human rights’ institutions in various parts of the world.” He said that the Bahraini government always adopts “repressive” strategies and kills opponents “brutally”. By taking such “inconsiderate” action Bahrain proved it is not after peaceful solution and a way out of the crisis, Iranian Foreign Ministry insists. “Undoubtedly, the Bahraini government will see the consequences of extremist actions and behaviors by following this path,” he said. The Bahraini government increases exerting pressure, imposing restriction on the opposition leaders and executing political prisoners while the Bahraini people and their political and religious leaders highlight the importance of settling crises through interaction, Qassemi said. Bahrain executed on Sunday the three anti-regime activists over their alleged role in a 2014 bomb attack. According to the Bahrain Mirror news website, the authorities have refused to return the bodies of the three activists to their families. ‘Iran will support Bahrainis’ demands’ Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a senior advisor to the parliament speaker, said on Sunday that Iran provides the Bahrainis with “political” and “spiritual” support to uphold their rights in conformity with the UN human rights charter. He said that execution of the three Bahrainis is clear example of human rights violation. “The Bahraini government should rely on its people instead of foreigners,” noted Amir-Abdollahian, who was Iran’s ambassador to Bahrain from 2007 to 2010. Amir-Abdollahian said that Iran does not interfere in Bahrain’s affaires, however will defend the Bahraini people’s “rightful demands”.
