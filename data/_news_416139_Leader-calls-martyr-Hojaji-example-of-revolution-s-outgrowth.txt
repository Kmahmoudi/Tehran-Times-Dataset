TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said Monday that martyr Mohsen Hojaji is a clear example of the Islamic and revolutionary outgrowth.
 Mohsen Hojaji, a member of the Iranian advisory support team in Syria, was captured by Daesh on August 7 near the Tanf border crossing in southeast Syria. The terrorists beheaded Hojaji two days later. The act prompted widespread condemnation of the terrorist group. Following the incident, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a post on his Instagram said Hojaji and other martyrs have sacrificed their lives to defend innocent Muslims and fight the atrocities committed by Takfiri terrorists and their supporters. The Supreme Leader who was speaking with a group of cultural activists and officials from Yazd and Hamadan provinces, put an emphasis on the need to boost “revolutionary and jihadist spirit”. “You should focus all of your efforts to revolutionary and religious education of the youth, and you should know that morality can be long lasting if it is accompanied with boosting revolutionary and religious spirit and jihadist movement,” the Leader told the cultural activists. The Leader went on to say that the officials should not act in a way that the “revolutionary movement” be undermined and instead the anti-revolutionary movement becomes stronger.
