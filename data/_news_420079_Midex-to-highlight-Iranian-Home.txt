TEHRAN - “Iranian Home”, an approach offering advantages of traditional handicrafts in modern homes, will come under spotlight at the 8th International Exhibition of Midex that revolves around interior and landscape designs.  “Iranian Home” made its debut at the 28th National Crafts Exhibition, which was held in Tehran last August. The initiative aims to promote Iranian crafts through presentation of their usefulness in practice.  Organized by Tehran-based Nama Negar International Co., the event will be held at the Tehran Permanent International Fairground from January 11 to 14. Last year, exhibitors from South Korea, Malaysia, Germany, Poland, Turkey, Finland, England, China, Belgium, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Italy, and Saudi Arabia amongst others attended the event.
