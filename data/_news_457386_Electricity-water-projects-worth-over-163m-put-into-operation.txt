TEHRAN – Some 23 water and electricity projects worth 6.86 trillion rials (about $163.33 million) were put into operation in four provinces through video conference. Inaugurated in the 38th week of the Energy Ministry’s A-B-Iran Program by the Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian, the mentioned projects were put into operation in Zanjan, Qom, Isfahan, and Semnan provinces.

The projects included desalination facilities, repair, and reconstruction of water transmission lines, a wastewater project, a water supply project, several electricity supply projects, three small-scale power plants, as well as several projects for improving the quality of the electricity network and reducing losses.
