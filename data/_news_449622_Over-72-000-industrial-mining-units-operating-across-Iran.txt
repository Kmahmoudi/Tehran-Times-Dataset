Iran’s Industry, Mining, and Trade Ministry plans to bring 1500 idle units, mostly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), back into operation by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 2021). Based on the ministry’s plans for the current year, reviving 1,020 unproductive small mines is also on the ministry’s agenda.
