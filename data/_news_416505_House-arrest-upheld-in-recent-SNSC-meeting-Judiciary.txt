TEHRAN –Judiciary spokesman Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje’i said on Sunday that the issue of 2009 election opposition leaders’ house arrest was raised again during a meeting of the Supreme National Security Council last week, where decision was made to uphold status quo, Mizan reported. This came days after government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht voiced optimism about steps to end the arrest. Mehdi Karroubi, Mir Hossein Mousavi and his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, were placed under house arrest early 2011 after they insisted on their claims of vote rigging and called for protest.
