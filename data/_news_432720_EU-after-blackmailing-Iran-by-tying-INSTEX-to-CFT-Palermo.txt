TEHRAN – Mohsen Rezaee, secretary of the Expediency Council, says he regards tying INSTEX, a financial channel for trade with Iran, to Tehran’s accession to the CFT and the Palermo Convention as some sort of blackmail. In a post on his Twitter account on Tuesday, Rezaee denounced the EU’s conditional implementation of INSTEX, saying that instead of such measures the Europeans must honor their commitments under the JCPOA, Tasnim reported. On Monday, Council of the European Union issued a conclusion on the Islamic Republic, urging Iran to "adopt and implement the necessary legislation pursuant to its commitments under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Action Plan."
