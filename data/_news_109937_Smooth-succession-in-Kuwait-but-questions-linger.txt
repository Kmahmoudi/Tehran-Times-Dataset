The cabinet's proclamation of crown prince Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, who has been ill since undergoing colon surgery in 1997, as new emir following the death of Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah on Sunday has dispelled fears of an immediate succession crisis. "I really feel very happy and comfortable at this step... because it was taken in accordance with constitutional channels. Kuwait proved that it is a constitutional state," political analyst Ayed al-Manna told AFP. "After this step, I believe there is no cause for concern." According to the 1962 constitution, the crown prince automatically becomes emir if the top post becomes vacant, but he assumes duties only after being sworn in by the elected parliament. Parliament speaker Jassem al-Khorafi said Monday after an informal meeting with MPs that a special swearing-in session for the new emir will be held fairly soon, adding he would set a date after receiving the cabinet decision. But Islamist MP Waleed al-Tabtabae said some lawmakers proposed a shorter version of the two-line oath due to the illness of the emir. Others, however, insisted that the oath must be read in full. The appointment of a crown prince is another issue that needs to be tackled sooner rather than later in light of the new emir's ill-health. According to the constitution and a 1964 law, the emir has the sole authority to name a crown prince, but his choice must be approved by parliament. If parliament rejects the appointment, the emir is then required to nominate three people from male descendants of modern Kuwait's founder Mubarak al-Kabir and MPs must choose one of them. Veteran politician Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who has been running the emirate's day-to-day affairs for several years, is tipped to get the post. "Sheikh Sabah is certainly the most likely candidate. I think he will continue to run the country's affairs as prime minister and possibly as crown prince," Manna said. But it was not immediately known if Sheikh Sabah would keep the premiership if he was named crown prince. The two posts were split in 2003 for the first time since Kuwait's independence in 1961 due to the poor health of then-crown prince and prime minister Sheikh Saad. Pro-reform political groups and activists insist they should remain separate because it makes it easier to hold the prime minister accountable. The unrecognized Islamist Ummah (Nation) Party called in a statement for keeping the posts of crown prince and prime minister separate. The party also demanded a "reformist government with the prime minister from outside the Al-Sabah family" to involve Kuwaiti commoners in the running of the country's affairs. Opposition political groups have in the past explicitly called for loosening the ruling family's grip on the cabinet. At present, members of the Al-Sabah dynasty hold six of 16 cabinet posts, including the key portfolios of defense, interior, foreign affairs and energy.
