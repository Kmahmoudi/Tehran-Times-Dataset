TEHRAN – The Iranian nation has dealt so many blows to the U.S. so that not only its military strength, but also its political wisdom have been affected, Hossein Salami, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps second-in-command, said on Friday. “The U.S. is on the brink of collapse of power,” Tasnim quoted Brigadier General Salami as saying at a cultural ceremony in the city of Shiraz. “Not only have we managed to keep the enemy (U.S.) away from the heart of our country, but we have also caused it to get entangled in various fronts where its power has been sapped,” he added.
