TEHRAN – The historical Gonbad-e Jabaliye, or Jabaliye Dome, is one of the architectural landmarks in southeastern Iran. Standing on the outskirts of Kerman, the octagonal building capped with a double-layered brick dome is made of stone, mortar, and gypsum. Although its exact date of construction is unknown, some experts believe its origins date back to the second century CE.  Narratives say it may be used as an observatory or the tomb of a dignitary. The structure is of high importance because it interweaves early Islamic features and elements with the architectural styles practiced during the Sassanid era (224 to 651). It currently houses a museum of old gravestones. Here is a select of comments that visitors to Gonbad-e Jabaliye have posted to TripAdvisor, one of the most popular travel websites in the world: “Ancient tomb, well preserved” A polygonal domed building on the outskirts of town, now a museum of gravestones (some of them worth a picture). Elegant proportions. (Stefano M. from Malaysia) “Nice well maintained monument” Visited this monument on my visit to Kerman , I wish they had some board or inscription giving a brief history about the place. (Harshdawer form India, visited February 2016) “Lovely park and setting” We stopped at Stone Museum on our way to Kaluts and I’m glad we did. The inside of the museum is full of old grave stones and I would say one can skip it. But if you are in the area I suggest that you stop by and enjoy the lovely art work in the part and take a few snaps of beautiful octagonal limestone building. If you have children they will enjoy the park as well.
