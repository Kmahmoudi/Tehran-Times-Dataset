TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, on Sunday slammed the ongoing brutal crackdown on the Rohingya in Myanmar, saying the Muslim community is suffering from organized crimes orchestrated by the Israeli regime. Velayati warned that such an “ominous and organized plot by international Zionism” would result in genocide against the Muslims, oppression and forced displacement, ethnic and racial cleansing, massacre and regional instability. He also said the world bears a heavy responsibility to have a correct understanding of such a calculated plot.
