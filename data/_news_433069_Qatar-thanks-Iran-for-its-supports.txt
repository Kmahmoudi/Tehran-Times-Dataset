TEHRAN – Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani has thanked Iran for supports during the blockade of the Arab country.
 “Iran is our neighbor. We share border with Iran. We share gas reserves with Iran. This is geography. We needed flight space and business route after blockade of Qatar and they [Iranians] opened their airspace to us and we thank them for that,” ISNA quoted him as saying on Sunday during a speech at the Munich Security Conference. In June of 2017, Saudi Arabia along with Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) abruptly cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and closed land, sea and air routes to the country. The severing of relations also included withdrawing ambassadors and imposing trade and travel bans on Doha. The Islamic Republic opened its airspace to about 100 more Qatari flights a day during the blockade.
