TEHRAN – A senior political analyst believes that an anti-Iran Arab coalition scenario is showing signs of failure. “The coalition can be deemed as a failure now that some Arab states have cut ties with Qatar,” Davod Hermidas Bavand told ILNA on Tuesday. Bavand said the Trump-pushed “Arab NATO” which was going to be led by Saudi Arabia has now been “nipped in the bud”. He predicted that Qatar is likely to be expelled from the six-nation [Persian] Gulf Cooperation Council. SP/PA
