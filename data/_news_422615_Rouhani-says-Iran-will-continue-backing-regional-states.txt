TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that Iran will continue supporting the countries in the Middle East region. 
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran has always been and will be supporter of the oppressed people and has always agreed to help regional countries fight terrorism upon their governments’ request,” Rouhani said at a meeting of authorities and ambassadors of Islamic countries with Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He also said that the U.S. aggressions against the regional countries will have no effect but “destruction” and “annihilation”. The U.S., Britain and France jointly conducted attacks on Damascus and surrounding areas on Saturday morning upon an order by President Donald Trump. Ayatollah Khamenei strongly denounced the airstrikes as a “crime,” saying the leaders of the three countries are “criminals”.
