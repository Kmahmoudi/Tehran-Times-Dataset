It provides an opportunity for individuals to temporarily escape pollution, stress, and daily pressures, allowing them to reconnect with nature. Ecotourism plays a crucial role in distributing tourists during peak seasons, ensuring a more balanced flow and reducing strain on popular destinations.

It increases cultural exchange and helps to strengthen solidarity and mutual understanding, Ali Nemati added. According to the minister counselor, Ecotourism creates employment opportunities, increases production and income, and strengthens local identity. By promoting services and adopting an environmental approach, ecotourism enhances societal attitudes and awareness towards rural villages, improving infrastructural and architectural factors. It also addresses sociocultural issues, promoting a holistic development approach. “To harness the potential of ecotourism we must focus on improving the attractions and service quality of rural tourism through targeted planning and training. Additionally, it is essential to empower local communities through skills training, restore historical monuments, and facilitate the flow of tourists to rural areas,” he said, adding, “To ensure the success of ecotourism initiatives, we must also develop the necessary infrastructure, including transportation networks and accommodation facilities. Diversification of tourism products, such as ecotourism, agricultural tourism, and creative tourism, will cater to a broader range of interests and attract a diverse set of visitors.” He went on to explain Iran's policies for the development and promotion of ecotourism and said: We are proud to report a significant growth in ecotourism in Iran. The number of tourists visiting eco-lodges has steadily increased, and that with it has brought an increase in the number of eco-lodges, contributing to economic development and poverty reduction. Our ongoing efforts aim to further promote and expand ecotourism opportunities across the country.
