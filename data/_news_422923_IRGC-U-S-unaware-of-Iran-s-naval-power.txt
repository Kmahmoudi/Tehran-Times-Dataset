TEHRAN - Real Admiral Ali Fadavi, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy, has said that the U.S. is not fully aware of Iran’s naval power.
 “The Americans have little information about Iran’s Naval power and they understand our real power when either their vessels are sunken or entangled in a terrible situation,” Rear Admiral Fadavi told Fars news agency on Sunday. He noted that while the speed-vessels across the world generally cruise at the speed of 35 knots, their Iranian counterparts voyage at the speed of 80 knots. Rear Admiral Fadavi also attached great importance to the IRGC Navy’s powerful presence in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman.  “We should also” be present “in the free waters in future,” he added. Fadavi told a joint forum of the Army and IRGC navies in Bandar Abbas in March that the U.S. has given up the military option against Iran due to the Islamic Republic efficacious deterrence. The IRGC and Army navies can deliver a “crushing response” to enemy aggression anywhere in the world, he said at the time. “Today, the Americans understand well that the Army Navy and IRGC Navy are a united hand in the sea which enjoys much more power than the Americans.” NA/PA    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
