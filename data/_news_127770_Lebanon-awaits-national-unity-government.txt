The urgency of establishing a national unity government became apparent when regional and extra-regional powers along with foreign-backed Lebanese parties tried to ruin the great achievements of the Lebanese nation during the 33-day war against the Zionist regime by attempting to foment sectarian strife in the country. However, the Lebanese people’s massive turnout for the celebration of Hezbollah’s victory in southern Lebanon was actually a national referendum for the continued existence of the Islamic resistance movement as the most important defensive force in Lebanon. The massive turnout for the celebration was a telling response to all the foreign-backed Lebanese parties that oppose Hezbollah. This referendum, which has confirmed the popularity of Hezbollah in Lebanon, shows that Hezbollah should play a more active role in determining the governmental and parliamentary structure of the country. Unfortunately, rather than trying to maintain the achievements of Hezbollah, the current Lebanese cabinet headed by Prime Minister Fuad Siniora is trying to weaken the Islamic resistance movement. Lebanese Defense Minister Elias al-Murr’s insistence on the disarmament of Hezbollah and the immediate deployment of UNIFIL peacekeeping troops will not improve the security situation in Lebanon, but, quite the contrary, will lead to a domestic and regional crisis. Meanwhile, along with the United States and Europe, some regional countries seem oblivious to the danger of the Zionists’ nuclear weapons and are trying to enforce UN Resolution 1701, which calls for the disarmament of Hezbollah. If carried out, such efforts will provoke a harsh reaction in Lebanon, paving the way for a new round of internecine strife. In addition, the recent statement by the Amal movement and Hezbollah, which stresses the necessity of Hezbollah maintaining its arms as a defensive counterbalance against potential Zionist aggression, doubly emphasizes the convergence of Lebanese parties against all threats. Such threats will remain as long as the Zionist regime has not fully withdrawn from Palestinian and Lebanese territories. Therefore, a premature disarmament of Hezbollah would only facilitate the reoccupation of Lebanon by Israeli forces. Hezbollah’s decision to retain its arms will pose no problem for the Lebanese government but will actually serve the Lebanese and help to maintain national security. Therefore, any measure meant to isolate Hezbollah only serves the interests of the Zionist regime. Clearly, the establishment of a national unity government embracing all Lebanese religious groups is the best solution to the crisis. If the current Lebanese government and UNIFIL troops try to disarm Hezbollah, Lebanon would be returned to the situation of the 1970s and 1980s, something the people will never tolerate. The Lebanese are in dire need of national unity, which will allow them to reconstruct their country undistracted by petty domestic disputes. However, this national unity can not be materialized unless the governmental structure of the country is altered in such a way so as to give all Lebanese political parties their rightful position. Thus, the current Lebanese government should address the legitimate demands of the nation and take measures to establish an inclusive government.
