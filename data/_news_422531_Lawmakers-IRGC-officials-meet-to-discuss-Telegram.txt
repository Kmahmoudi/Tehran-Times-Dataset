TEHRAN â€“ A number of lawmakers on Tuesday met with intelligence officials of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to exchange views on social media apps, especially Telegram. After the meeting, MP Hossein Naqavi Hosseini dismissed as sheer lie the lack of security in domestic messaging apps, emphasizing that moving from foreign messaging apps to domestic ones is a public demand, ISNA reported. He also said five domestic apps will be ready to be used by the end of the Persian month of Farvardin, so that businesses would not be harmed in case foreign apps are blocked.
