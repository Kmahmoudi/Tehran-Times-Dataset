TEHRAN – Chinese Ambassador to Tehran Pang Sen on Sunday stressed China’s firm decision to confront new U.S. sanctions against Iran, saying his country will continue cooperation with the Islamic Republic despite U.S. pressure, IRNA reported.
 “Beijing is opposed to the U.S. unilateral policy and continues cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran, considering its responsibility on the international scene,” Pang said in a meeting with Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker. “Bilateral relations should be pursued; the current cooperation between the two countries is based on international law,” Ambassador Pang added.
