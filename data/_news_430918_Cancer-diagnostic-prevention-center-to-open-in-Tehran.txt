TEHRAN — A cancer diagnostic and prevention center will be inaugurated in Tehran within the next few months, CEO of Shahr-e Salem (healthy city) Company, affiliated to Tehran Municipality has said.
 The center will be up and running within few months in Keshavarz Boulevard, central Tehran, and we are just waiting for the Health Ministry’s permit for setting up the center, IRIB quoted Hamid Choubineh as saying on Wednesday.  Deputy Health Minister Reza Malekzadeh said in April that “population-based cancer registry of the Islamic Republic of Iran” shows a cancer incidence rate of 158 per 100,000 of the population and 143 per 100,000 of the population (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) in 30 provinces of Iran annually.
