TEHRAN –Iran has shown full commitment to an internationally-backed deal on its nuclear program, the United Nations atomic energy watchdog chief said on Sunday following Iran’s decision to start working on nuclear-powered vessels and complaints over the U.S. disrespect for the deal.  "We are satisfied with the implementation of the (agreement) and hope that this process will continue,” Yukiya Amano told reporters in Tehran, according to IRNA news agency.  "Iran has been committed to its engagement so far and this is important,” Amano was quoted as saying after a meeting with Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi. Amano arrived at Tehran on Sunday for “high-level consultation with between Iran and the IAEA.” Tehran has complained that the recent U.S. Congress vote to a bill which extends sanctions against Iran for another ten years infringes on the terms of the nuclear deal.  "We are satisfied with the implementation of the (agreement) and hope that this process will continue,” Yukiya Amano says. Washington, on the other hand, says the Iran Sanctions Act would not affect the overall implementation of the nuclear agreement. Under the deal finalized in 2015, Iran rolled back its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, mainly imposed by the U.S. and European countries.   Reacting to the U.S. move, which would become law even without President Barack Obama's signature, President Hassan Rouhani ordered Salehi to start developing systems for nuclear-powered propulsion used in marine tranportation.  In a separate directive, Rouhani commissioned Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to raise the sanctions renewal in a session with signatories to the deal.  In a recent development on Sunday, Zarif announced that he had written a letter to European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, requesting for a meeting to look into the move.  AK/PA     All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
