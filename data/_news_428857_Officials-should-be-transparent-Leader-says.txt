TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has said that officials should be “transparent” and should not hide any secret from the people.
 “Officials should be transparent and should not hide any secret from the people except for military and security matters,” Ayatollah Khamenei told his theology students on October 15.  Pointing to a letter by Imam Ali (AS) to military men, the Leader said all the managers and officials of the Islamic system should act based on this letter. He added officials should not distance themselves from the people because of the position they have. Officials and economic experts have been insisting on the need to fight corruption and act transparently. Economists and sociologists consider transparency as an important tool to counter sanctions.   In an article in the Iran newspaper on August 27, Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi likened corruption to a “seven-headed dragon”, suggesting that E-government is the most important tool to fight it.  In remarks in December 2018 President Rouhani said transparency is the only tool to fight corruption. “We have no solution other than transparency to root out corruption and we all should go to glass house so that the people can watch our performance,” Rouhani noted.    In similar remarks a few month later, Rouhani asked the Economy Minister to publish on its website the sum of money that goes to each ministry or organization each month. Also, on October 7, the Majlis voted in favor of the CFT, a legislation to increase financial transparency and thereby combat the financing of terrorism.
