TEHRAN- Rahim Hayat Qureshi, the Pakistani Ambassador to Iran, on Monday called for a deepening of ties between Islamabad and Tehran at a meeting with the head of the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
 He emphasized that expanding Pakistan-Iran collaboration in many domains has no restrictions or bounds. According to Qureshi, Pakistan and Iran are prepared to expand their current levels of media and cultural collaboration. “Since the coming to power of President Ebrahim Raisi’s government, the relations between Tehran and Islamabad have witnessed an upward trend,” he stated, praising the concern and goodwill of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei towards the Pakistani nation.  “We believe that these sanctions have put the Iranian nation under pressure, and it goes without saying that when one part of the Muslim Ummah faces difficulty and damage, other Muslim nations will also suffer,” said Qureshi, reiterating his government's steadfast opposition to the oppressive sanctions imposed against Iran. "For the past three years, I have tried my best to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations," said Qureshi, who has been serving in Tehran as a diplomat for three years. "Signing some documents and cooperation pacts, as well as the exchange of delegations between the two countries, are examples of such efforts." The ambassador expressed hope that two joint border markets would be established between Iran and Pakistan soon, saying they would help increase trade and economic ties between the two countries. In the interim, he stated that six joint border markets will be built between the two nations in accordance with a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that had been signed.
