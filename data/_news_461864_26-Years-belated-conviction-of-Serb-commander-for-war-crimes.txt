UN war crimes judges on Tuesday upheld a genocide conviction and life sentence against former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic.
Mladic, 78, was convicted in 2017 on charges of genocide and war crimes including terrorizing the civilian population of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and the killing of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys.
