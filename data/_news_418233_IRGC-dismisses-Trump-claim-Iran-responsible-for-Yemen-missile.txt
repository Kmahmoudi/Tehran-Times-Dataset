TEHRAN – The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) on Sunday dismissed as unfounded claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that Iran was responsible for a missile launched from Yemen over Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The missile was launched on Saturday at King Khaled International Airport on the northern outskirts of Riyadh. “Trump’s claim of Iran’s role in the launch of missile from Yemen to Saudi Arabia is unfounded,” Mohammad Ali Jafari said. He said, “Mr. Trump has said many unfounded and wrong words and has accused Iran of many things and this is another accusation.”  The IRGC chief added, “It is not possible for us to transfer missile to Yemen.” The top general said these missiles “belong to Yemenis themselves” which have upgraded their range “in line with taking revenge for blood of their martyrs”. Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami also dismissed claims that Iran was behind the missile attack, saying the U.S. uses any opportunity to level accusations against Iran.
