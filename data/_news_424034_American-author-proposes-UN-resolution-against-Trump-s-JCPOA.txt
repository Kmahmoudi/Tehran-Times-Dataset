TEHRAN – An American author and technology editor at Executive Intelligence Review in Washington has proposed submitting a resolution to the UN Security Council over the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the JCPOA could be “fruitful”. “It would probably be more fruitful to pose such a resolution from a positive standpoint,” Marsha Freeman told Tasnim, answering a question about Ayatollah Khamenei’s demands to European signatories of the deal. She also said, “I think the Europeans, Russians, and Chinese will continue to honor the agreement, regardless of what the U.S. does.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
