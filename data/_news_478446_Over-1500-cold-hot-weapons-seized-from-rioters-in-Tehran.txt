TEHRAN- The commander of the 27th Mohammad Rasulullah Division of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) announced on Monday that during the insurgency in Tehran, at least 1500 weapons of all kinds were confiscated from those striving to ransack public properties and foment insecurity in the capital.   Brigadier General Hassan Hassanzadeh also noted that such proportions are tantamount to doctored plans in a bid to spell troubles in Tehran.  He added that many of them are captured while the move sparked a hunt for other rioters.     While stating that the biggest goal of the enemy is to prevent the progress of the Islamic Revolution, General Hassanzadeh underlined that among the arrested people, there are a number of dual nationals as well as foreign-related intelligence individuals, members of MKO, and other groups opposed to the Islamic Republic, who were planning to spread riots in the capital Tehran. Likewise, Brigadier General Ahmad Ali Goudarzi, commander of the Iranian border guards, said during the last 45 days his forces have destroyed multiple trafficking rings and found 600 war weapons. Seizure of war weapons grew 26 percent compared with the preceding year, the commander said, the police said in a report on its website on Monday. During a visit to Iran's borders in the southeast, the commander stated that recent turmoil caused by the U.S. and Israeli regime, as well as their operatives within the country, had created challenges for the security of “our beloved compatriots.” He emphasized that border guards are vehemently opposed to any attempt to disobey the law. "Our border guards are the stronghold of the Islamic Republic of Iran's sacred system,” the commander added.  Based on the police report issued on Monday, one leader and three instigators of the recent disturbance in the central Iranian city of Najafabad have been detained. Following the recent unrest in Najafabad, in which a number of individuals were duped into taking to the streets and committing desecration of sanctities, the local police initiated an investigation. According to the report, the police detained one of the organizers of disturbance in the city after receiving intelligence.  The police also confiscated a large number of cold weapons and other items used in clashes with the police when searching the organizer’s hideaway.
