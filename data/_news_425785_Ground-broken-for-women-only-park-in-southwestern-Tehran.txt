TEHRAN – Ground was broken for a women-only park with a total area of 11 hectares in the city of Islamshahr, southwestern Tehran, here on Saturday.
 The park will be equipped with indoor swimming pool, a standard walkway, ping pong tables and a football field, volleyball and basketball courts, said Hooshang Asgarian, head of Islamshahr’s Gardens and Green Spaces Organization. Construction of such centers will certainly help to decrease social vulnerability, said Mohammad Ali Norouzi, Islamshahr’s Friday prayer leader. The women-only park creates proper grounds for women’s social and cultural activities, said Norouzi. There exists six women-only parks in the city of Tehran.
