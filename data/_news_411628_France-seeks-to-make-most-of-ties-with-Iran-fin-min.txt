TEHRAN - French companies are seeking to make the most of capacities and opportunities in bilateral relations with Iran, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said in Tehran on Saturday.
 France and Iran have been very successful in regard to boosting economic ties, Sapin said in a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. As a member of the European Union, France has taken every effort toward the implementation of the nuclear deal, IRNA quoted the French minister as saying. Many economic deals between the two countries, including in the aviation and automotive industries, have come into force, he said, adding that holding joint economic committee meetings show that bilateral negotiations are well progressing. Zarif, for his part, said that Iran is seeking to expand relations with France and sees this country as an important economic and political partner. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a meeting with Zarif in Tehran in January that economic ties and collaboration between the two sides has witnessed a 200-percent increase over the past year. During the meeting, Zarif said Iran-France bilateral trade stood at €1.7 billion during January-November 2016, an increase of three-folded compared to the same period in 2015.  In February, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a meeting with President Hassan Rouhani that a “new chapter” has opened in ties with Iran.
