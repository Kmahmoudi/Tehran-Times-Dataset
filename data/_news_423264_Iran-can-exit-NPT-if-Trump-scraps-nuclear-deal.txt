TEHRAN – A member of the Expediency Council says Iran can exit the 2015 nuclear pact or the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if the U.S. withdraws from the deal. Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghadam said the decision should be made after through consideration by the Council for Monitoring the Implementation of BARJAM (a Persian acronym for the nuclear deal), IRNA reported. In a statement on January 12, Trump gave Europeans only 120 days to agree to an overhaul of the nuclear agreement and said if the text of the deal is not revised he would unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from it. The deadline falls on May 12. MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
