TEHRAN – Pedram Soltani, the vice chairman of the Iranian chamber of commerce, has argued that if Iran fails to join the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the country will deprive itself from selling oil, even to China. “Under the current circumstances, in order to be able to keep open our banking and financial channel with the European Union and China and all countries that are willing to buy petroleum from us, Iran’s monetary and banking transactions need to be recognized as low-risk transactions,” IFP on Saturday quoted Soltani as saying, citing Khabar Online.
