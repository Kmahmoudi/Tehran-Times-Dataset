TEHRAN - Iran’s border guards are preparing to launch more unmanned aircraft patrols across the country’s vast borders, expressing satisfaction with the previous experience. “At some border points we use different technologies such as drones for monitoring purposes, as the need may arise,” said Brigadier General Qassem Rezaie. The use of drones can help Iran minimize increasing security costs related to drug traffickers and terrorist intrusions. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes, only in 2008, Iran, coupled with Turkey, accounted for more than half of global heroin seizures and registered, for the third consecutive year, the highest seizures worldwide. The country has the technology for such surveillance mission, and unmanned air vehicles are being used by Iran’s military quite extensively already. “Most of the equipment are domestically manufactured, and good achievements have been made,” the commander remarked, referring to the country’s capacity. Over the past years, the country has unveiled a number of homegrown drones, indicating surprise advances in the field. In September, commander of Iran’s General Staff of Armed Forces Major general Mohammad Baqeri said his country has long-range drones which can target positions with one-square-meter surface.
