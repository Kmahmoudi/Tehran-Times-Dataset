TEHRAN â€“ The vice presidency for science and technology has set up an innovation network for commercial drones and unmanned aerial vehicles, Mehr reported on Tuesday. The network aims to connect industrialists, professionals and knowledge-based companies active in the field of designing and manufacturing drones and UAVs. Technological development, production, and services are different sections of the network. The technological development section is underway in Iranian universities with an eye to the future. The network also aims to provide facilities and expand the market for knowledge-based companies active in this field. Entering the international market and creating brands for drones and other products are other aims of the network. The use of drones in some of these sections was originally completed using helicopters and airplanes. However, these are expensive to hire and not always available when they were required.
