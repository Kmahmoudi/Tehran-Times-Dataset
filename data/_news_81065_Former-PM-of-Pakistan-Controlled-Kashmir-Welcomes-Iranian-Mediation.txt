Talking to IRNA on Friday in Islamabad, he said that Iran enjoys good relations with both India and Pakistan and can act as a mediator to bring the perspectives of both sides closer. Sultan Mahmood thanked Iran for its efforts to resolve the regional conflict, especially the trip made by the Iranian foreign minister to both countries two weeks ago. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, in a telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart, expressed Iran's readiness to help solve the two countries' problems. The former Kashmiri leader also thanked Moscow, especially Russian President Vladimir Putin, for its efforts toward de-escalating tension between the two neighboring countries. India and Pakistan, in recent weeks, have accused each other of shelling civilian areas in the border regions of the Line of Control (LoC), which divides  disputed Kashmir between the two countries. Tensions between India and Pakistan intensified following an attack on a military-residential area in the Indian town of Jammu in May. India accused Pakistan of sponsoring the attack, which left 30 Indian military personnel and civilians dead, an accusation denied by Pakistan.
