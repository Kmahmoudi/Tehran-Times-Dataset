In an interview with IRIB, Adnan Mousapour said this market has already brought some fruitful results such as balance in foreign currency exchange rate. On July 4, Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Valiollah Seif announced about official inauguration of secondary foreign exchange market in that day.

According to the governor, the secondary market will only provide private sector businessmen and those from small businesses with services. Iranian government is on the process of renovating its foreign currency system via managing domestic foreign currency market, reigning the currency rates, improving cooperation with exchange shops, and reinforcing exports.
