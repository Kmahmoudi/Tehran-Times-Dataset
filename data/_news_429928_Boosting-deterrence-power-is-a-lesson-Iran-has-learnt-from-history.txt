TEHRAN – The history of Iran necessitates boosting deterrence power, Defense Minister Amir Hatami said in a speech at the opening ceremony of the ninth version of the biannual Iran Airshow on Kish Island.

 Iran Airshow, started on Monday and will last until Thursday, features aerial displays including potentials as well as the latest achievements in aviation, airlines and aerospace by companies from Iran, China, Russia, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Republic of Azerbaijan. Hatami said the airshow is the embodiment of resolve, independence, and resistance against the domineering powers. “The advances in science and technology are an honor for all nations. Yet, those nations that climb the ladder of success while under the pressure of the bullying powers … will enjoy an extra sense of pride,” the defense minister remarked.    Hatami further noted that the airshow is an instance of self-confidence in the face of the brutal sanctions against the Iranian people. “Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran is standing vivaciously, robustly, proudly and confidently against the hate-mongering, two-faced,… and criminal officials of America,” the minister said in an open reference to United States’ unilateral exit from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposition of toughest sanctions on Iran.    He added, “This show along with its guests is an illustration of  the fact that with imposing the cruel sanctions against the Iranian people, they [the U.S. officials] have tarnished their own reputation, and their efforts to hinder the progression and independence of the Iranian nation has proved to be a mere mirage.”  Elsewhere in his speech, Hatami said the Islamic Republic’s principles are based on “peace and prosperity for all”, “friendly cooperation” and “a violence-free world”. The minister went on to say, “We believe that our neighbors are permanently with us; hence, according to our policy, their historical and strategic memory, their sentiments and sensations, their beliefs and values, as well as their strategic logics are like clean slates that we never would like to be stained by anything.” He stressed that what Iran is after nothing except promoting its deterrence power so that no one would dare to even think of attacking Iran. “This is what history has taught us.”  SP/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
