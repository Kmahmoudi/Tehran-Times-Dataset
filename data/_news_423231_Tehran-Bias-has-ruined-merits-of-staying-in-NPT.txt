TEHRAN – The Iranian ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has lashed out at biased approach toward certain countries regarding the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, stressing that such prejudice has ruined the merits of staying in the NPT.

 Addressing the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) at the UN office in Geneva on Wednesday, Reza Najafi blasted attempts by certain countries to use non-proliferation as a pretext to prevent other states from using nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. “Countries that have themselves built nuclear weapons are not allowed to prevent (other) countries’ use of peaceful nuclear technology under the pretext of (promoting) non-proliferation,” Najafi said, according to Fars news agency. “The right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and full participation in the exchange of equipment, materials and nuclear know-how for peaceful use of nuclear energy is one of the fundamental objectives of the NPT,” he said. To ensure that this right is enforced, the Iranian envoy said Article IV of the NPT has obliged the parties to facilitate such exchanges, therefore all NPT member states possessing advanced nuclear technology need to fully comply with their obligations under Article IV of the treaty.
