TEHRAN - Pakistan has welcomed a new round of talks between the Afghan Taliban and international stakeholders expected to be held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pakistan’s foreign office spokesman Dr. Mohammad Faisal said Pakistan is committed to peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. “Talks are being held in UAE. We hope this will end bloodshed in Afghanistan and bring peace to the region,” he remarked. The Taliban, according to a report in AP, confirmed that “another meeting" is to be held on Monday with the United States, this time in the UAE. They said that the talks will involve representatives of other countries –including Pakistan. In recent months, the process of talks has gained momentum with Moscow hosting an important conference on Afghanistan and the U.S. appointing special envoy to negotiate with the Taliban. Islamabad’s role in these ‘peace talks’ is being seen as critical since Islamabad enjoys leverage over the group which is believed to be based in Pakistan.   On Saturday, China also pledged to help Afghanistan and Pakistan in resolving the imbroglio, as officials from the three countries flew to Kabul for a trilateral meeting. China’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, held the meeting with foreign ministers of Afghanistan and Pakistan on Saturday to chalk out a plan to support Afghan peace process.  “China approves of this, and is willing to provide support and help for Pakistan and Afghanistan to improve their ties,” Wang told reporters after the meeting.
