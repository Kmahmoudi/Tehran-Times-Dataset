TEHRAN – Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that any negotiations should be backed by military strength.
 Addressing eulogists, he said, “I approve of political dialogue on international level. But now," he said, “It’s the time of both missiles and dialogue.” “If the Islamic system pursues technology and negotiations without defense power, then this will be a retreat in the face of threats from other insignificant countries,” the Supreme Leader remarked. He added, “Enemies continue strengthening their military and missile sectors. How can anyone say that the era of missiles has passed?” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
