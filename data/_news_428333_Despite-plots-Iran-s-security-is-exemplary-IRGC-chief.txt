TEHRAN - Chief of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Monday that in spite of enemies’ plots, Iran’s security is exemplary.
 “We do not have any problem in the areas of defense and security, but we should make more efforts in the areas of soft, media and economic war. We are making preparations and gaining experience to counter enemies’ plots,” he said during a speech at a ceremony naming the new managing director of the IRGC representative in Hormozgan province. The IRGC commander says the Zionist regime of Israel supports the Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) and the monarchists to undermine security in Iran. He said that the Zionist regime of Israel supports the Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) and the monarchists to undermine security in Iran. He added that Iran has achieved many successes in a situation in which any country, except Iran, would have collapsed. Basij and the IRGC have the heavy responsibility in the spheres of defense, security, culture, society and politics, Jafari said. He added that the IRGC is implementing eight plans to promote Basij. Elsewhere, he said that enemies have focused on economic pressure, however, the Iranian people will defeat them through resistance which is a “long, dangerous and difficult path”. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the 2015 nuclear deal in May and ordered re-imposition of sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions were snapped back in August and the second round will be returned in early November. Trump’s secretary of state Mike Pompeo said in May that the U.S. will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic.
