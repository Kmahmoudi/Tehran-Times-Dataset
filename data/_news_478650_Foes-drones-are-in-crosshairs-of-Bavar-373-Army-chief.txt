TEHRAN- The commander-in-chief of the Iranian army underscored on Sunday that the promotion of indigenously developed Bavar-373 air defense system is a considerable breakthrough, consisting of a collection of state-of-the-art knowledge and technologies.  In a ceremony held to honor elites cooperating in the upgrade of Bavar-373 system, Major General Seyed Abdolrahim Mousavi stressed that the hegemony of Western media will never let Iranian nation stay thrilled over such technological developments.  Certain top military figures attended in the event including Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh, Commander of Army Air Defense Force Brigadier General Alireza Sabahifard, and other top military brass at Khatam Al-Anbia Air Defense Academy.  The Army chief also extended condolences over the martyrdom of a set of Iranians in the terrorist attack in Shah Cheragh shrine in Shiraz on October 26 as well as those who lost lives in recent riots in certain cities of Iran.  “Those who committed such crimes to lower the country’s security and safety, should be held to account. However, the main culprits are the U.S. officials in both incidents-insurgency and act of terror. The U.S., Zionist regime, and the tattered ideology of Saudi Arabia play vital roles in engineering and implementing both the instability and carnage,” General Mousavi remarked.  He also pointed out that the Bavar-373 can target offensive drones at a range of 304 kilometers. The top commander praised the Army's Air Defense Force, as well as all enterprises, knowledge-based companies, and institutions participating in developing the system. With the emergence of the Islamic Revolution, he said, the Western domination led by the United States is doomed to die. In addition, he said, when the grand idol crumbles, smaller ones will fall by themselves.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
