You just pass days looking forward to upcoming semester, to get marry, to become parent or to retire! The bad news is that these days are counted as your life! And the days you eye are full of such moments that you cannot avoid. If you think you are not in a place you deserve or not with people you like just move. As American author Jim Rohn suggested ‘If you don't like how things are, change it! You're not a tree!’ create moments you like and enjoy every moment of your life! Live in the moment and enjoy it! Be good! SB/ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
