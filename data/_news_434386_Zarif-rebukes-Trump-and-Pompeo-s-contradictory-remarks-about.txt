TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Friday that President Donald Trump and his secretary of state Mike Pompeo make “contradictory” claims against Iran depending on the occasion.
 For example, Zarif said, on one occasion the Trump administration claims that Iran is about to “collapse” and another day it claims that Iran is a “great power” that is threatening NATO like Russia and China.  “Flip-flop par excellence: one day US claims Iran on verge of collapse, the next we’re demonized as a “Great Power” that threatens NATO. @SecPompeo & his boss will make any contradictory claim that fits an occasion,” Zarif tweeted. Contrary to such remarks, Zarif said, Iran is a “responsible” country that is seeking peace. “In contrast, Iran is consistently responsible & peace-seeking,” Zarif remarked. During a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Washington on Thursday, Pompeo called for unity to confront what he called “great power” challenges from Russia, China and Iran. “We must continue to do so, especially in this new era of great power competition from Russia, from China, and the Islamic Republic of Iran,” AP quoted Pompeo as saying. In an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, Trump claimed that Iran may collapse because of his administration’s policies, including leaving the international nuclear agreement with Tehran negotiated by his predecessor. Trump pulled the U.S. from the 2015 international nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in May 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran.
