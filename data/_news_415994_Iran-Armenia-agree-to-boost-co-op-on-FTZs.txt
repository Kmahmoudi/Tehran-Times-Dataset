TEHRAN- In a meeting between Iranian President’s Advisor Akbar Torkan and Armenian Minister of Economic Development and Investments Suren Karayan, the two sides mulled over expansion of cooperation on both sides' free trade zones (FTZs), IRNA reported on Wednesday.  Torkan, who is also the secretary of Iran’s Free Trade, Industrial and Special Economic Zones Council, named Armenia Iran’s bridge for transporting and exporting goods to Europe. The two countries can even export their jointly manufactured products to other countries, he said.
 
He also underlined the capability of Iranian contractors in developing free trade zones in Armenia, in case the required infrastructure is provided by the country's government. The Armenian minister, for his part, said that his government has always paid a specific attention to its economic and trade relations with Iran, adding that by manufacturing a wide range of products in their own free trade zones and exporting them to Europe, Iran and Armenia can renovate the region’s economic relations.
