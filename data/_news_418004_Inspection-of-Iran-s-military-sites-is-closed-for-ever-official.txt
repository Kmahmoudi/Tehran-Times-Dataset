TEHRAN - Behrooz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, has said the dossier of inspecting Iran’s military sites has been closed forever.
 “The issue of inspecting our country’s military sites has been settled once for all time and sealed by the IAEA Board of governors,” he told IRIB in an interview published on Saturday. The issue of inspecting Iran’s military sites has not been mentioned in the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he noted The IAEA can only access the sites in which there is nuclear activity, he added. “There is no reason to enter a place where no nuclear activity is being done. During the past years, foreign media outlets launched baseless propaganda claiming that some [suspicious] activities were being done in Parchin and we ended the issue once for all time which was confirmed by the Board of Governors,” he stated. He added that Iran’s nuclear activities are being carried out in the sites whose information has been announced to the IAEA. Elsewhere, Kamalvandi urged the IAEA to fulfill its duties in a “professional” and “independent” way without bowing to political pressure. He also said attempts to “revive commotion against Iran” are “fruitless”. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
