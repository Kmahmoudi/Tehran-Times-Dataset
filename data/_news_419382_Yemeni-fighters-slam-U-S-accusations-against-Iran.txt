TEHRAN – A spokesman of Yemeni fighters has strongly criticized U.S. charges that Iran is funneling missiles to fighters in Yemen, known as Houthis, Washington Post reported. Muhammad Abdul Salam said on Friday that Washington is “fabricating lies” to escape the repercussions of its recent decision to recognize the city of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as Israel’s capital, a move that triggered protests in the Muslim world including in war-torn Yemen. It came after the U.S. claimed it has “undeniable” evidence that Tehran is violating international law and unveiled segments of missiles launched at Saudi Arabia from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen.
