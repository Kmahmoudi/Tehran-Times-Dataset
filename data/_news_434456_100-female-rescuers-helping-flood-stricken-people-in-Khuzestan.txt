TEHRAN – A number of one hundred female rescuers are helping people in flood-stricken areas of the southwestern province of Khuzestan, said Hamid Qavidel, a representative for the Relief and Rescue Organization of the Red Crescent Society. The female rescue team provides the vulnerable flood-stricken women and children with relief services as well as social and psychological supports, IRNA quoted Qavidel as saying on Sunday. Women are considered as the vulnerable group in the unexpected events for their physical situation, therefore, they should receive special help, noted the official. He added that the female rescuers are present at the emergency camps in order to help young women and girls, pregnant women, women’s child delivery and caring infants. Following torrential rain in many regions across Iran since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year on March 21, catastrophic floods have hit 1,900 cities and villages in western, southwestern, northern and northeastern Iran, leaving 70 dead and hundreds of thousands displaced. Extreme flooding inundating many provinces across the country have brought heavy financial losses amounting to 9.5 trillion rials (nearly $226 million) to the agriculture sector in Khuzestan. The Iranian Red Crescent Society says it has not received any cash for humanitarian aid from other countries for the flood victims in Iran as there are no monetary channel to receive such aid.
