 During the meeting, which took place in Tehran, Jaberi Ansari congratulated Senemaud on his appointment as the special envoy for Syria.  Pointing to the capacities available to improve cooperation between Iran and France in bilateral and multi-lateral spheres, Jaberi Ansari stressed Tehran’s readiness to boost consultations and cooperation to help settle regional conflicts, particularly the Syrian crisis.  The Iranian official said that since the beginning of the Syria conflict, Tehran has believed that the crisis has no military solution.  “Now that the fight against terrorism in Syria has resulted in great achievements and the ground has been prepared for restoring the sovereignty of the Syrian government over major parts of the country, the three issues of facilitating the return of refugees, getting the Syrian Constitutional Committee to start its work, and activating the committee on the exchange of detainees and the missing people are the major political and humanitarian priorities at the current stage,” Jaberi Ansari stated, the Foreign Ministry said on its English website. Senemaud, for his part, said Iran, as a big country and a major regional power, could play a big role in restoring stability to Syria and pushing forward the process for political settlement of the conflict.  The former French ambassador to Tehran said Paris supports the priorities mentioned by Jaberi Ansari and stressed Paris’ readiness for cooperation with Iran for political settlement of the Syrian conflict.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
