TEHRAN – Iranian police authorities announced on Sunday that they had arrested four leaders involved in inciting unrest in downtown Tehran.  The intelligence organization of the Iranian police said the arrested leaders played a key role in calling for rioting at Enghelab Square at the heart of the capital Tehran.  The arrests were made in continuation of measures by Iranian security forces to counter those who were involved in leading unrest that erupted in the wake of the death of Mahsa Amini in September.
