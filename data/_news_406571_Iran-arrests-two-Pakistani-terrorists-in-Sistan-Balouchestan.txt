TEHRAN – The IRGC intelligence forces have arrested two Pakistani terrorists in the southeastern province of Sistan-Balouchestan, Tasnim reported on Tuesday. According to a statement issued by IRGC’s Salman Intelligence Center, the forces took action soon after they learned that two terrorists have entered the country. The statement said the two terrorists were detained in an operation in Saravan, a town near Iran-Pakistan border, before they could carry out any attacks. Following the arrests, it was announced that the two terrorists were from Pakistan and have been members of an anti-Iran terrorist cell.  “They entered the country with the aim of spreading terror and carrying out sabotage acts,” the statement added. It went on to say that two bombs, which were planned to be detonated in crowded places, were found but IRGC bomb disposal teams defused the bombs. The terrorists admitted that they were planning to carry out terrorist attacks inside the country, the IRGC said. Earlier this month, IRGC forces dismantled a terrorist group in southeastern province of Sistan-Balouchestan, saying that the terrorist group was backed by Saudi Arabia and the United States. Also in June, Iran said it had thwarted several planned bombings in Tehran and other cities, in what it called a major plot by Daesh militants against the country.
