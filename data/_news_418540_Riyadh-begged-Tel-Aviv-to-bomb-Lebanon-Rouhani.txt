TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani has slammed Riyadh’s interference in Lebanon, saying it is “shameful” for a Muslim country to “beg” the Israeli regime to carry out military strikes against the Lebanese nation. President Rouhani made the remarks at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. “It is unprecedented in history for a Muslim country to take such measures, and this indicates the immaturity of the individuals, who have come to power in those countries,” Press TV quoted the president as saying. The comments came days after Hezbollah secretary general Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah made similar remarks. Nasrallah said Riyadh had appealed to the Israeli regime to attack Lebanon in the name of fighting Hezbollah, and was ready to spend billions of dollars to reach such objective. Earlier this month, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation in a televised program broadcast from Saudi Arabia, where he is reportedly under arrest. Rouhani said forcing out the prime minister of Lebanon and even naming a replacement is “open interference” in the internal affairs of an independent country. “What position are you in and by relying on what authority do you take such measures? How long do you think [your] money can serve [your] purposes?” he asked emphatically. The president also pointed to Saudi Arabia’s brutal military campaign against Yemen, asking, “Why has a country, which considers itself to be serving the two sanctuaries [of Mecca and Medina], has come to pressure the innocent and Muslim people of Yemen in such a way?” Saudi Arabia and its allies launched a military campaign against Yemen in 2015 in order to restore a former pro-Riyadh government there. More than 12,000 civilians, including women and children, have been killed since the onset of the Saudi-led aggression against Yemen. “The United Nations has adopted silence in the face of these crimes, and refuses to take a decisive and binding position, and European powers support such crimes as well,” the president remarked. Riyadh has never expressed regret over the invasion and continues its atrocities in Yemen, Rouhani added.
