TEHRAN – In a statement on Tuesday, Iran’s diplomatic mission in the United Nations rejected any arbitrary interpretation of the UN Security Council resolution 2231, IRNA reported. “Iran firmly rejects any arbitrary interpretation of the provisions of resolution 2231, according to which, Iran is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles ‘designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons,’” the statement reads. “As a conventional defensive capability, Iran’s ballistic missile program is designed to be exclusively capable of delivering conventional warheads and, as a result, none of Iran’s ballistic missiles are designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons,” it added.
