TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani announced plans for renovating 70,000 clunker trucks annually within the framework of policies to combat air pollution. In a live TV interview aired on Monday night, Rouhani talked about air pollution among other important domestic issues and regarded clunker vehicles as a key cause of this challenge. He went on to say that nearly 230,000 clunker trucks are plying in Iran and the administration plans to do renovate them in a 3-year period. Trucks will be produced by domestic car manufacturers, although their engines will be imported, added Rouhani. He further noted that low-interest loans will be granted to clunker truck owners to actively encourage them to scrap their vehicles, adding, right after scrapping, new trucks will be delivered to them.  The renovation will lead to reducing diesel usage by 50 percent, said the president. The excess diesel will be exported and the oil ministry is tasked to finance part of this plan accordingly. Developing public transportation, and providing standard fuels were among other measures which are being pursued by the administration to fight air pollution, added Rouhani. SDS in southwestern provinces Referring to sand and dust storms in southwestern provinces, particularly Khuzestan, he noted that trees have been planted in an area of some 5,000 hectares in the southeastern city of Ahwaz – as a source of sand and dust storms.  Till the end of the current [Iranian calendar] year (March 20), the area will increase to 30,000 hectares, he added. Fighting sand and dust storms requires huge budget and cannot be done without the contribution of neighboring countries, highlighted Rouhani. Rundown areas renovation to get underway  Elsewhere in his remarks, Rouhani highlighted that projects to renovate rundown areas will get off the ground by the end of the current [Iranian calendar] month of Bahman (February 19). Unfortunately due to the low profit rate in this sector the private sector has not agreed to make any investment yet, Rouhani regretted, adding, however, as per a new scheme proposed by the administration those living in dilapidated buildings can have their houses renovated without having to pay anything.  Within the framework of this scheme people can live in another houses rent-free provided by the government while their houses are being reconstructed.
