TEHRAN- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani appointed the ex-governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), Valiollah Seif, as his special advisor for monetary and banking affairs. Despite the critics repeatedly lashed out at Seif for his policies, in particular those about foreign currency market during his office at CBI, Rouhani selected him as his advisor in a decree on Thursday, Tasnim news agency reported. Referring to the proven capabilities of Seif in the monetary and banking domains, Rouhani hoped that he would succeed in this new position. Struggling to check a steep depreciation of the rial and root out a series of irregularities in Iranâ€™s banking system, Seif was replaced by Abdolnaser Hemmati following a cabinet meeting on July 25.
