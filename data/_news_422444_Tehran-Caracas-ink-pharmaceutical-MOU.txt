TEHRAN – Iran and Venezuela signed a memorandum of understanding to boost cooperation in pharmaceutical sector. Iranian Health Minister Hassan Qazizadeh-Hashemi and Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Jorge Arreaza inked the MOU in Tehran on Saturday.

Touching on the great potential of Iran in health sector and drug manufacturing, Qazizadeh-Hashemi highlighted that Iran’s health sector and drug manufacturing ranks first in the region. Venezuelan companies can use the Iranian expertise to manufacture drugs with their own brands to both satisfy the domestic needs and raise export revenue. The minister also expressed Iran’s readiness to help Venezuela fight Malaria, saying, malaria took once around 16,000 lives annually in Iran but the figure has decreased to some 60, which are all related to individuals who come from Pakistan. He also proposed holding an exhibition in Caracas by the title of ‘Iran’s capabilities in health and medicine sector’. Arreaza, for his part, highlighted that Venezuela seeks tangible results in health sector through cooperation with Iran. Referring to sanctions imposed on his country, he added that boosting cooperation with Iran in health sector is a priority for Venezuela.
