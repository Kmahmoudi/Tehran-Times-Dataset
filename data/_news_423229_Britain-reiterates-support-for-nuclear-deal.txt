TEHRAN – British government spokesman Edwin Samuel said on Thursday that his country will support the Iran nuclear deal, underlining Prime Minister Teresa May’s decision to continue backing the multilateral agreement. Samuel said the British government’s stance vis-à-vis Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu’s statements is clear, noting London supports the deal as well as the institutes in charge of monitoring the implementation of the international pact, IRNA reported. He further said that a likely withdrawal of the U.S. from the deal is not in the interest of the region, Persian Gulf littoral states and Britain. The spokesman also said there are some points in the deal which can be amended. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
