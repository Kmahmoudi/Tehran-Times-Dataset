Following his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Iran “can do what they want” in Syria.

 Trump made the comment during a conversation with reporters at the end of a cabinet meeting in the White House.  “Iran is pulling people out of Syria, but they can frankly do whatever they want there,” Trump said, according to Haaretz.  Administration officials told the New York Times on Monday that after pressure from military officials and politicians Trump has agreed to a gradual withdrawal from Syria.  The officials added Trump has given the military four months to withdraw its 2,000 troops currently in Syria. Trump said Syria is “sand” and “death". Trump admits ISIS is more likely to attack Iran than U.S. Trump went on to say that his administration was not interested in facing the challenge posed by Syria. "We don't want Syria. Obama gave up Syria years ago when he didn’t violate the red line. I did when I shot 59 missiles but that was a long time later. And when President Obama decided not to violate his statement that never cross the red line and then they did and he didn't do anything about it." He added, "When we kill ISIS (in Syria), if we don't – oh then everyone says then they'll come to our country, well that's possibly true of a very small percentage but you know where else they're going? To Iran, who hates ISIS more than we do. They're going to Russia, who hates ISIS more than we do.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
