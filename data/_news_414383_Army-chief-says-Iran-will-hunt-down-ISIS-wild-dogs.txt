TEHRAN – The commander of Iran’s Army has said that terrorists will not dare to approach Iran’s borders, noting that the army will crush them if they do so, ISNA reported. Major General Ataollah Salehi said on Sunday that as long as the Army is present near the country’s western borders, no terrorists can pose threats against the Islamic Republic. He also referred to Daesh (ISIS) terrorists as “wild dogs” who will be hunted by the Iranian forces. “We will hunt down their masters as well,” he remarked.
