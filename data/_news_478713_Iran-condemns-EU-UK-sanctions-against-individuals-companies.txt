TEHRAN- Nasser Kanaani, the spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry, on Tuesday called the EU and British sanctions against certain Iranian individuals and businesses "unjustified, illegitimate, and interventionist" and strongly condemned them. Kanaani stated that it appeared that the European parties' habit to sanctions had resulted in the “isolation” of Europeans’ rationale and calculus and that with such flawed mentality Europe is reducing the range of its interactions. “Apparently, addiction to sanctions has isolated Europeans’ rationality and calculus, and with such a wrong approach it is Europe that is limiting the range of its interactions,” the spokesman noted.  Iran will reserve the right to respond to such “pointless and destructive” actions, Kanaani added.  The foreign ministry spokesman went on to say that the Islamic Republic depends on its national strength and distinctive experiences to meet such challenges and that it will act in accordance with its national interests. During a meeting on Monday in Brussels, the foreign ministers of 27 European Union members adopted a fresh round of sanctions against 29 individuals and three organizations in Iran. The new restrictions block financial transactions between sanctioned Iranians and European businesses and nationals and freeze the assets of such persons and organizations. The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), provincial police chiefs, army and police commanders, the interior minister, and the Press TV were among the people identified by the EU. As a result, the total number of sanctioned Iranian individuals and businesses sanctioned by the EU now stands at 126 and 11, respectively. According to EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, the EU bloc will apply harsher sanctions on those guilty of what he called suppressing Iranian protesters. At the same time, Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office announced sanctions against Iran's telecommunications minister, interior minister, and several IRGC and police officers. The Islamic Republic of Iran warned the West that such involvement would have consequences, and Tehran would not tolerate such actions.
