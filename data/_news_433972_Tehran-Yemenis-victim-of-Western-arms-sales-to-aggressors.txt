TEHRAN – Tehran has denounced the Saudi-led coalition’s “brutal” aggression against Yemen, saying the Yemeni people are the everyday victims of weapons granted and sold to the aggressors by some Western countries. “When they (Yemenis) are alive, their innocent voice is not heard, but with their innocent deaths they sign the bill of shame of those false human rights advocates,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, Mehr reported on Monday.   He further slammed the self-proclaimed human rights advocates for remaining silent in the face of daily massacre of the Yemeni women and children. “They are also complicit in these crimes because of selling arms to the aggressors,” he added.
