TEHRAN - A leading Iranian political commentator has said that U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration speech was not worthy of his status as a president.

He was talking like one who is running a presidential campaign,” Ali Khorram told ISNA on Saturday. “Trump is a populist demagogue,” Khorram said, adding that the Trump did not mention any details about his plans.
