TEHRAN – Presidential chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi has said talks between Iran and Taliban were held in coordination with the Afghan government, stressing that the Islamic Republic would never interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. “I have never seen a report showing the Afghan government’s dissatisfaction with Iran-Taliban talks,” ISNA on Friday quoted Vaezi as saying. “Iran’s neighbors are faced with many problems including civil war,” he remarked. “Iran attaches great importance to peace and stability in the region, and instability in Afghanistan can spread into Iran.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
