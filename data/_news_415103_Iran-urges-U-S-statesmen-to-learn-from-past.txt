TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Saturday that the U.S. statesmen should learn from the past and talk about Iranians respectfully.
 His comments came after the U.S. President Donald Trump called Iran a “threat” and “rogue regime” in a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Thursday. “Today, we face new threats from rogue regimes like North Korea, Iran, and Syria, and the governments that finance and support them,” he said. Qassemi said, “Apparently, his [Trump’s] advisors are still living in their previous delusional atmosphere and are not aware of international developments as they were unaware in the past.”  He advised Trump’s administration pay attention to Iran’s “positive” and “constructive” role in the world.
