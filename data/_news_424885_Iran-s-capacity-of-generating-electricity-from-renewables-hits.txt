TEHRAN- The capacity of generating electricity from renewable resources has reached 581 megawatts (MW) in Iran, ILNA reported on Friday. Power plants based on clean energy resources with the capacity of 493 MW are currently under construction in the country. According to Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Homayoon Haeri, Iran’s solar and wind farms capacity will increase to 1.4 gigawatts (GW) in the next Iranian calendar year (March 2018-March 2019). Renewables, including hydropower, account for just six percent of energy generation, versus natural gas’ 90 percent share. Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence in the regional electricity market.  Generating electricity from renewable resources has resulted in saving 456 million liters of water over the recent years. According to Iran’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (known as SATBA) the number of small scale solar power plants across the country which are used by households or small industries is being increased noticeably as Iranian households and small industries have embraced the new technology with open arms and investors also seem eager for more contribution in this area.
