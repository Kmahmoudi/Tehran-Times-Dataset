In the first phase, 300 Samands will be exported to Turkey, but the figure is expected to increase to 3,000 within the next ten months, noted head of Iran’s major auto producer, Iran Khodro Industrial Company (IKCO) representative office in Turkey. Currently, 21 IKCO authorized dealerships in seven major Turkish cities are prepared to offer after-sales services to Samand owners, a report quoted him as saying here on Saturday. Given the joint cultural and religious ties between the two Muslim nations and the good technical specifications of the Iranian car, outlooks for the presence of Samand in Turkey’s competitive auto market are promising, he also commented. French, German and Italian cars are among the most favored automobiles in Turkey.
