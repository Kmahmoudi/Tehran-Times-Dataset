TEHRAN - Amid allegations that Iran is involved in the manufacture and sale of military drones to Russia, Iranian businesspeople and top Russian military leaders have both been subject to fresh sanctions by Britain. The 16 penalties are a response to Russia's ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, according to a statement released by the British Foreign Office on Tuesday. The sanctions, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said, were directed at twelve senior military officers who were involved in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. One of those targeted is Major General Robert Baranov, who is thought to be the leader of a team in charge of targeting and programming Russian cruise missiles. The designations, based on his words, are targeted at "Iranian businesspeople and a military officer engaged in the manufacturing and/or supply of military drones used to launch operations." The UK stands with Ukraine, cleverly said, adding that "Russian troops' planned attacks on Ukrainian cities and innocent civilians will not go unanswered." Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, “wants to shatter the spirit of Ukraine, but he will not succeed,” he noted, adding, “The nation of Ukraine will triumph and rebuild.” The most recent event occurred a day after the Russian embassy in London categorically rejected Cleverly's "inappropriate claims," which falsely said that Iran was giving Russia weapons and ammunition for its military assault in neighboring Ukraine. Britain claims that drones made in Iran have been a key component of assaults on people, citing U.S. claim from December 9 that Iran has emerged as one of Russia's main military suppliers and has sent Russia hundreds of drones. Russia and Iran have both vehemently refuted allegations that Tehran sent Moscow drones for use in the conflict in Ukraine. In July, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made the first anti-Iran allegations, claiming that Washington had "information" indicating that the Islamic Republic was getting ready to give Russia "up to several hundred drones, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline" for use in the conflict.
