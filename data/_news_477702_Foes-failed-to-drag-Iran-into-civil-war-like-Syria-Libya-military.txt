TEHRAN- The alertness of the people has thwarted foes’ plots to incite all-out violence in Iran like Syria and Libya, the military advisor to the commander-in-chief said on Sunday.  “Didn’t enemies want to mire us in a war like Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan? They want to do it even now, but why they failed? Because we have been, and continue to be, ready and vigilant,” Amir Hatami said, Press TV reported. Speaking at a military ceremony, Hatami added, “When they want to impose a war on a country, they make calculations first, and if it is not in their benefit, they won’t start a war.” Hatami, who was defense minister from 2017-2021, insisted on the importance of science and technology to establish security. “We must take good advantage of science and technology to establish security in the country. We have used technology in the field of air defense. If we want to be successful in possible future wars, we must pay due attention to technology and science,” he pointed out.  Brigadier General Hatami stressed that the greatest avenues to fend off a potential conflict are to be well-prepared and grow in strength. Meanwhile, Brigadier General Alireza Sabahi-Fard, commander of the Iranian Army's Air Defense Force, said the domestically developed and produced Bavar-373 (Belief-373) surface-to-air missile system now has an operational range of 300 kilometers. In addition, Sabahi-Fard noted that Iran has conducted preliminary testing of the Bavar-373 missile system with a range of 300 kilometers, complimenting the nation's advancements in the design of high-altitude air defense systems. A target or plane may be detected by the Bavar-373 system at a distance of more than 300 kilometers, locked on at roughly 250 kilometers, and destroyed at 200 kilometers. President Ebrahim Raisi stated earlier this month that the country has managed to follow the road of growth despite all the threats and sanctions while addressing a parliamentary session, stressing that Iran's forward momentum has enraged the adversary. Raisi praised the Iranian people's awareness against the enemy's plots amid recent foreign-backed riots that broke out across the nation over the death of Mahsa Amini. Raisi continued by saying that the enemy's ploys were frustrated by the presence of millions of Iranians at the scene to defend their nation's ideals and to show their hate for the rioters. Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi has also said the opponents, mainly the United States and Israel, are actively attempting to foment conflict among the states of the region. He emphasized the necessity of being watchful in the face of such schemes. "Adversaries had better avoid any act of adventurism against Iran," Vahidi said, noting that Iran's foreign policy is built on fostering the best relationships with its neighbors.
