TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that people’s honest and rightful demands should be heeded and separated from acts of violence and sabotage. The honest and rightful demands of people is different from destructive moves of a group,” Ayatollah Khamenei said in a meeting with a large group of people from Qom. In reference to recent protests across the country, Ayatollah Khamenei emphasized that all Iranian officials must pursue the demands of the people. “Protests or people’s demands have always existed and they also exist today,” but such protests should be differentiated from those who insulted Islam, the Quran, the national flag and also burnt mosques. The Leader says a “triangle” of enemies – with the United States and Israel comprising one of its sides, a filthy-rich Persian Gulf littoral state on its second side and the anti-Iran MKO terror organization on the third side – has been plotting for the past few months to foment chaos and violence in Iran.The Leader also lauded the Iranian nation for their response to the enemy’s plots to foment chaos and violence in the country. “These are not normal incidents. [These incidents] occur nowhere in the world,” the Leader said, pointing to the people’s massive show of support for the establishment. He described the riots that hit some areas of the country as “fireworks and vicious acts”. “It is not a matter of one or two or five years. [It is about] a battle between the nation and those hostile to the nation; a battle between Iran and those hostile to Iran; a battle between Islam and those hostile to Islam,” the Leader remarked, according to the Press TV. He said a “triangle” of enemies – with the United States and Israel comprising one of its sides, a filthy-rich Persian Gulf littoral state on its second side and the anti-Iran MKO terror organization on the third side – has been plotting for the past few months to foment chaos and violence in Iran. “The plot has been hatched by Americans and Zionists. They have been working on it for several months, planning to begin from small towns and then move on towards the center. The cash comes from one of the filthy rich Persian Gulf littoral states. Obviously, such projects need money, but the Americans won't be willing to spend anything as long as they have these [rich puppets],” the Leader said The third side of the triangle, Ayatollah Khamenei added, was the “murderous” Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), whose elements served as lackeys on the ground. The Leader went on to say that the U.S. will surely pay a price for inciting violence in Iran. Ayatollah Khamenei also said U.S. President Donald Trump, whom he described as mentally “unbalanced”, must know that his mad stunts will not go unanswered.
