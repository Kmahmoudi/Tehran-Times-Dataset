TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani on Friday condemned assassination attempt against former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. Kanaani wished speedy recovery for the former prime minister and others in the attack at a political rally at Wazirabad in Punjab province on Thursday. In the attack one person was killed and several others injured. The attack prompted protests among Khan’s supporters. A bullet hit Khan in the leg, said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) senior leader Asad Umar. Umar said Khan “has been shot, there are pellets lodged in his leg, his bone has been chipped, he has also been shot in his thigh.” Khan was taken from the rally site to receive treatment in Lahore, around a two-and-a-half-hour drive away, and was in a stable condition, Umar added.
