TEHRAN – The Islamic Coalition Party is going to introduce a representative for Iran’s 2017 presidential election.

 “We came upon the decision that whether or not principlists make a coalition, the Islamic Coalition should name its representative to the election,” the party’s Secretary General Mohammad Nabi Habibi said on Friday, Fars reported. “A party that passes an election without a representative is not really a party,” he said, but added, “If a coalition is made, we will surely prioritize the common viewpoint of principlists.” SP/
