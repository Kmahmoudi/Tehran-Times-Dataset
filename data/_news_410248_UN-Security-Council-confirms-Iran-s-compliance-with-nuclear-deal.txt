The UN Security Council has confirmed that Iran has complied with the provisions of the historic nuclear deal with the P5+1 countries.
 Speaking at Wednesday’s meeting of the council, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Fletman briefed the council on its Resolution 2231 which endorsed the deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Feltman described the nuclear agreement as “a good example of how multilateral diplomacy, political will and perseverance can resolve the most complex issues.” “It is imperative that its participants, the United Nations and the broader international community continue to support the full implementation of this historic multilateral agreement for its full duration,” he said. “It’s comprehensive and sustained implementation guarantees that Iran’s nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful,” Fletman pointed out. Feltman said Iran has not received any unauthorized nuclear-related items since the agreement was signed, adding that no information was received regarding Iranian ballistic missile activities in violation of the resolution. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, reading a statement on Wednesday, lauded the deal as “a major achievement” and said all participants have fulfilled their commitments. Mogherini pointed to “a staggering 63 percent” growth in EU-Iran trade in the first three quarters of 2016 as an example of the results of removal of bans against Iran. During his election campaigns Donald Trump threatened that he would “tear up” the deal or try to renegotiate its terms if elected president. He has also referred to the nuclear agreement as "the worst deal ever negotiated." Mogherini said in an interview on Wednesday that the JCPOA is neither unilateral nor bilateral, meaning that it cannot be renegotiated by one party alone. “So it is a multilateral framework and we are ready protect and to preserve it,” she added. On Tuesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also stressed that any manner of negotiations on the JCPOA would be meaningless. Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China -- plus Germany started implementing the JCPOA on January 16, 2016. Under the nuclear deal, Iran undertook to put limitations on its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of nuclear-related sanctions imposed against Tehran. Since the implementation of the JCPOA, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on multiple occasions confirmed Iran’s compliance with its obligations under the nuclear agreement.
