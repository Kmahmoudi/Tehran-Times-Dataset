TEHRAN – In a forum held on Monday Iranian President Hassan Rouhani signed and declared the Citizen Rights Charter, saying upholding citizens’ rights is a policy of his government.
 “The 11th government (sitting government) seeks to show its determination to implement the citizens’ rights through unveiling the charter,” Rouhani stated.  The charter, which comprises 120 articles, insists on the right to a “decent life” such as right to clean water, health services, freedom of speech, clean environment, holding rallies, access to information, etc.    The executive body is duty bound to implement all the terms in the charter, Rouhani told the forum entitled “Constitution and People’s Rights”.  The president called on the Judiciary and Legislative bodies to help the government in applying the charter. Implementing the charter is “beneficial” to all and lays a “good basis” for “integrity and national unity”, the president remarked. Rouhani added the charter provides the “main basis for development of the country”. “The citizens’ Rights (Charter) declares to the world that the Islamic Republic of Iran has the capacity to use all the new legal peculiarities of the today’s world within the framework of its Iranian Islamic culture,” the president stated. Rouhani says all Iranian citizens enjoy equal rights regardless of their “ethnicity, gender, religion, and political tendency”.
Rouhani also said that all the citizens in Iran enjoy equal rights regardless of “ethnicity, gender, religion, beliefs and political tendency”. He added, “The government of Iran is obligated to provide the condition for right to life, human dignity, and justice for all Iranians including Iranians inside and outside the country regardless of ethnicity, religious belief, age and gender.” The right to life is a moral principle based on the belief that a human being has the right to live and, in particular, should not be killed by another human being  NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
