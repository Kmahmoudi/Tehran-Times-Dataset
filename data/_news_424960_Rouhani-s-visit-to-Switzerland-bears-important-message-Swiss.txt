TEHRAN - Markus Leitner, the Swiss ambassador to Tehran, has said that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to Switzerland bears an important message to Europe and other countries.
 Rouhani was scheduled to leave Tehran for Bern on Monday for a two-day visit. In an interview with Fars news agency published on Sunday, Leitner said that Rouhani’s visit is “symbolic” which shows trust. He said that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Swiss counterpart, Ignazio Cassis, plan to meet on Monday. Rouhani and Swiss President Alain Berset are scheduled to meet on Tuesday. He noted that the two countries’ officials plan to discuss the roadmap which was drawn up in 2016. Commenting on bilateral relations, Leitner said that he is “optimistic” about expansion of economic relations. ‘Iran has taken wise actions after U.S. withdrawal from nuclear deal’ Leitner also said that Iran has taken “wise” and “strategic” steps after the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “We regret that the U.S. quitted the JCPOA,” he said. “Switzerland has its own stances and we regret that the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear deal. We are interested in President Rouhani’s visit to Switzerland. The U.S. decision on the nuclear deal has not affected Switzerland’s invitation [for Rouhani’s visit],” he noted. He described the JCPOA as a “useful” agreement and expressed hope that Iran would remain in right position. Switzerland hosted several rounds of nuclear talks between Iran and the P5+1 group (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) which lasted for about two years. On May 8, President Donald Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the UN-endorsed nuclear agreement and threatened Iran with worst sanctions. Iran has repeatedly warned that if its interests are not guaranteed under the nuclear agreement it would resume its nuclear activities with a greater speed.
