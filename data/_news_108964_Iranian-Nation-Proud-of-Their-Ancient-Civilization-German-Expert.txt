Participating in the 9th International Conference on the Study and Conservation of Earthen Architecture held at Dowlatabad Garden from November 29-December 2, Horst Schroeder said that German people are well aware of the value of their historical and cultural monuments and find their cultural roots in such monuments. “Considering the effect of mud and brick on the environment health, the Germans have long been doing a wide range of research works on brick and mortar,” he added. He continued that proper information dissemination in addition to good training accompanied with appropriate publicity through mass media, will inform people how to preserve their cultural heritage. In some parts of Europe and Germany, several buildings made of mud, brick, and wood are built as samples, of which some are churches, some houses, and some used as kindergartens, he said. He also mentioned that many historical earthen buildings exist in Germany which  greatly differ from those in Iran due to cultural and geographical difference in the two countries. The conference ended on Tuesday in the world’s first earthen city Yazd where it was launched for the first time in 1971. RM/SRM END MNA
