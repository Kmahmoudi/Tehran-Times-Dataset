In a meeting with Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki, Foreign Ministry officials, and Iranian ambassadors, charges d’affaires, and other diplomats based in foreign states, the Supreme Leader said that gaining access to nuclear technology is a great national demand and a natural right for Iranians, adding that the nation would have to pay a heavy price if it renounced this right. He stated that peaceful application of nuclear energy is an inevitable necessity for the country’s progress in various fields, adding, “Any kind of retreat at this juncture will lead to an endless chain of pressure and retreats in the future. Therefore, this decision is irreversible, and the foreign policy body should bravely uphold the country’s nuclear rights.” Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the main reason the U.S. and some other countries are attempting to prevent Iran from attaining its inalienable scientific right is that they are afraid Iran will reach a high scientific level. “They say Iran has kept its nuclear activities a secret, but this is an illogical statement because every country only reveals scientific activities at the stage of research once they yield successful results, and based on this fact, Iran has made public announcements of the various stages through which its nuclear installations have passed through.” The Supreme Leader noted that the U.S. administration thinks it can realize its global goals through the use of weapons or money. “But they will never succeed, just as they didn’t in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine.” He noted that Washington has experienced defeats due to its miscalculations and its disregard of the aspirations and identities of nations. “They disseminate false information about Iran, and if they try to deal with Iran based on this information, they are certainly doomed to failure.” Referring to the recent remarks of U.S. President George W. Bush, who said that there is no democracy in Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei noted, “If there is a place with no democracy, that place is the United States. “In America the results of elections are determined by a minority of investors, who are mainly Zionists. The people’s votes are of no value and most of the people do not take part in the polls. Mr. George Bush himself became president through vote fraud.” Turning to the country’s foreign policy, Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the field of diplomacy is an arena of cooperation to meet national interests through reliance on national strength. He said faith, self-confidence, vigilance, courage, activity, and creativity within the framework of the principles and goals of the Islamic system are some of the main characteristics of Iranian diplomats. Iranian envoys in foreign states should represent Iran’s national dignity, resistance, and vigilance, he noted. “Islamic identity and dignity, which have now become more visible in the Islamic world due to the achievements of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, are some of the most important factors of the country’s national strength, which need to be taken into consideration in international relations.” The Supreme Leader also called Iran’s diverse population, sensitive geographical location, and abundant energy resources as well as the people’s Islamic faith, great awareness, and enthusiastic participation in various decision-making processes and elections other signs of the country’s strength.
