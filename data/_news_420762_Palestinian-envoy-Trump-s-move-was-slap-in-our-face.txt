TEHRAN – Manuel E. Hassassian, the Palestinian Authority president’s envoy to London, said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel was like a “slap in our face”. Speaking to IRNA, Hassassian said the U.S. has blatantly supported Israel against Palestine and has lost its credibility as a mediator. Trump has made a mistake regarding the issue and has made the Zionist lobby in the U.S. happy, he said. The diplomat also said Trump’s unilateral recognition would only isolate America, as no other country would follow this decision.
