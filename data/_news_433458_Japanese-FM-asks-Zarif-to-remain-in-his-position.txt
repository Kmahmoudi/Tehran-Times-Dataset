TEHRAN – Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono voiced his surprise over the sudden resignation of his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif asking him to remain in his position. According to ISNA, Kono said during his weekly press conference that he had met with Zarif and talked on the phone with him several times, describing the Iranian foreign minister as a moderate diplomat who played a significant role in brokering the Iran nuclear deal in 2015. “I know that under Iran’s laws, Dr. Zarif is still officially foreign minister, so I ask him to stay in his position,” he added.
