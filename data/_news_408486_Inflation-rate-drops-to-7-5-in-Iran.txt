The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has announced that the inflation rate in the past Iranian calendar year, which ended on March 19, 2016, stood at 11.9 percent. On June 14, Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Ali Tayyebnia said the country planned to reduce the inflation rate to a single digit by the coming two months. The goal was achieved in the third Iranian calendar month of Khordad (ended on June 20) when the inflation rate hit 9.5 percent.
