TEHRAN – Mohammad-Hassan Aboutorabi Fard, the interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran, said the Leader’s guidance for the “second phase” of the Islamic Revolution is a charter for self-improvement and society building and is also a new chapter for the Iranian nation’s revolutionary movement. Addressing worshippers, Aboutorabi Fard further said the Leader’s statement provides a clear explanation on the past and sets a roadmap for solidifying a dynamic Islamic system to reach an Islamic civilization, Mehr reported. “The Islamic Republic is not passive, but it is like a living wilful phenomenon which is always dynamic and corrects its mistakes,” he added.
