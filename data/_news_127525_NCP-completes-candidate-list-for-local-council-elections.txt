The NCP Special Elections Committee drew up the list out of 215 proposed candidates, Gerami-Moqaddam told the Iranian Students News Agency. The most important criteria by which the candidates were evaluated were administrative and political experience as well as academic studies and expertise, the reformist MP said. “The candidates were chosen from administrative managers, governors, former members of parliament, chiefs of government organizations, and deputy ministers.” The list is not limited to NCP members and includes members of all reformist groups, Gerami-Moqaddam explained. He also expressed hope that most of the NCP list would correspond with the lists of other reformist parties or groups. The Assembly of Experts and local council elections will be held simultaneously on December 15.
