The anti-Zionist Jews, known as Neturei Karta, often hold rallies and demonstrations inside Israel and in other countries in support of the violated rights of the oppressed Palestinians. The anti-Zionist Jews are presently getting prepared for a large demonstration against the Zionists in the coming days. The Overseas Service of the IRIB interviewed Rabbi Yisroel Moshe, one of the leaders of Neturei Karta in Bait-ul-Moqaddas, about the recent incidents in the occupied territories and the anti-Zionist measures taken by the Jews opposed to the illegitimate Zionist regime. Referring to the history of Palestine, he said the Jews who lived in Bait-ul-Moqaddas were opposed to the occupation of Palestinian land by the Zionists. "Even now the Jews are infuriated by the actions of Zionist Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who desecrated the Temple Mount by entering that place along with some 3,000 soldiers." Orthodox Jews living in Bait-ul-Moqaddas have very good relations with Arabs and are opposed to the Zionist entity, he pointed out. "These Jews have repeatedly held demonstrations against the Zionists, and every time the Zionist forces have beaten up the young and elderly Jews, shedding blood on the streets." The rabbi further said that a large demonstration would be held against Zionists in the coming days on the Zionist Independence Day, which is called by the Zionists as the Re-Creation Day. "Orthodox Jews take part in demonstrations wearing black clothing and call for the annihilation of Zionists. These demonstrations are held every year, and the Zionist television broadcasts only a few minutes of these rallies." There were also some demonstrations before the Israeli elections in February against Sharon, and the Orthodox rabbi banned his followers from taking part in the elections.
