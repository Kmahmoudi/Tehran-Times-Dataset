TEHRAN – Iraqi ambassador to Tehran Rajih al-Moussawi on Monday voiced his country’s readiness to hold the Arbaeen ceremony, saying some 3 million Iranian pilgrims come to Iraq annually which shows the two nations’ close ties. He also urged the Iranian pilgrims to apply for visas right away. An Iranian official has also said both countries stress the need for pilgrims to obtain visas to attend the Arbaeen ritual which falls on November 9 this year. Arbaeen marks the end of a 40-day mourning period that commemorates the seventh-century death of Imam Hussein (AS), the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH).
