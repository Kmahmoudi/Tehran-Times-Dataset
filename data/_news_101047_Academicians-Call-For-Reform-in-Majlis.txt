The academicians said that the extremist and factional performance of certain MPs to pursue brouhaha had provoked them to write the letter, stressing that the Majlis must struggle to engage in resolving the economic problems of the people. They also recalled the prevailing critical situation of the Persian Gulf region after the U.S.-British campaign against Iraq, as well the U.S. increasing pressure against the Islamic Republic, and warned that the remarks by some MPs will deteriorate the threats against Iran. "Certain MPs are trying to foment suspicion over the existence of two governments in Iran, and are at the same time questioning the legitimacy of the Iranian government," they wrote in the letter. "Such positions that are absolutely against Iran's national interests and are meant to encourage the global arrogance to intensify its pressure against Iran have eventually resulted in an act by the U.S. Congress to support the recent riots in Iran." The academicians further said the performance of the sixth Majlis with regards to economic issues has not been satisfactory, stressing that several Majlis ratifications have also resulted in deteriorating the economic situation. Elsewhere in the letter, they highlighted the need to promote national unity and solidarity as the only solution for Iran's development and prosperity and to thwart the threats against the country.
