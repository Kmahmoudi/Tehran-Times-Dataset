TEHRAN – Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, has said that the U.S., the Zionist regime and Saudi Arabia are after creating other crises in the region. Boroujerdi made the remarks in a meeting with Sheikh Hassan Ezzedin, head of the Hezbollah political council for Arab-African relations.  “The U.S., Zionist regime and Saudi Arabia lost hope in the power of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, so they launched several other projects such as the Iraqi Kurdistan incidents, creating political crises and choosing al-Quds as the capital of the Zionist regime,” Mehr quoted Boroujerdi as saying. “They failed in all these projects, nevertheless,” he added. The top lawmaker also expressed satisfaction over the recent victories of the resistance front against ISIS and other Takfiri groups in Syria and said the enemies of Islam failed once again to involve Syria, Iraq and the entire region in yet another conflict. He called the policy of supporting the resistance front and the downtrodden Palestinians an unchangeable policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, saying, “According to Ayatollah Khamenei, there is a bright future ahead of the oppressed peoples in the region and we can see that the Zionist regime is approaching its end day by day.” For his part, Ezzedin expressed gratitude to Iran for the help it extended to the resistance front and called the Islamic Republic a powerful ally that played a key role in foiling U.S. plots. “Trump seized power with the very intention of strengthening the Zionist regime and other terrorist groups and is now implementing his plans,” Ezzedin said. “The measures taken by Saudi Arabia and its allies are clear signs of their support for the Zionist regime and the U.S., which are after debilitating the Muslim world,” Ezzedin remarked. Other members of the Hezbollah political council present in the meeting condemned the policies of the U.S., the Zionist regime, Saudi Arabia and their allies in creating crises in the region and stressed the necessity of strengthening the resistance front in order to counter such policies.
