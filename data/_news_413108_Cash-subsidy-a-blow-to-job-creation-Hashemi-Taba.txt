TEHRAN – Presidential contender Mostafa Hashemi Taba has strongly criticized the cash handout plan, saying it deals a hard blow to job creation.

 “Distributing money among people goes against the job creation culture,” he stressed in an interview with the IRIB on Tuesday. “It is a lie and an impossible thing that they say they triple the subsidies and by so doing give people well-being,” Hashem Taba stressed, adding cash subsidies encourage “laziness”.
