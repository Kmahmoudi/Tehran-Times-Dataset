TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif arrived at Germany on Wednesday for the Munich Security Conference.  According to the official website of the MSC, the top Iranian diplomat is slated to deliver a speech at the international event on Sunday morning. Zarif is accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Abbas Araqchi and Deputy Foreign Minister for American and European Affairs Majid Takht Ravanchi. More than 500 participants are planned to take part in the event, including 50 foreign ministers, 30 defense ministers, and 90 parliamentarians.  Over the past five decades the conference has become a key annual gathering for the international "strategic community."  Since its foundation in 1963 as "Internationale Wehrkunde-Begegnung," the MSC has been an independent forum dedicated to promoting peaceful conflict resolution and international cooperation and dialogue in dealing with today’s and future security challenges. It has especially focused on the transatlantic partnership.
