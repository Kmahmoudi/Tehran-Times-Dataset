TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said on Monday that air raids on Syria show the “political bankruptcy” of the United States.
 “This attack shows the U.S. political bankruptcy. The U.S. and certain European countries that accompanied the U.S. committed crime without having a clear reason for what they did,” Salehi told reporters. The U.S., Britain and France jointly carried out attacks on Syria on Saturday. The attack took place one week after a suspected chemical weapons attack in the Syrian town of Douma near Damascus. Western countries claimed the Syrian government was responsible for the attack. Syria rejected by the claim. Salehi said the U.S.-led attacks were a “failure” for Washington and its allies. Salehi who served as foreign minister from 2011 to 2013 also said, “The people awakened and realized the true identity of the hegemony”. It has been revealed to the people that the U.S. politicians adopted an “unwise”, “cruel” and “brutal” policy, he added. On Saturday, Ayatollah Khamenei strongly denounced the airstrikes as a “crime”, calling the leaders of the U.S., Britain and France are “criminals”. In a phone conversation with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that attack on Syria was “obstinate”, “illegal” and “unilateral”. Zarif said attack on Syria before investigation of the issue by international organizations is “questionable”. In phone talks on Sunday, the Iranian and Russian presidents said the strikes on Syria can trigger a “chaos” in the world. Rouhani said the attacks violated international law and if they go unanswered by international bodies, more of such chaos in the world will be conceivable. For his part, Putin said further Western missile strikes on Syria would lead to chaos in international relations, Russian news agencies cited the Kremlin as saying. “Vladimir Putin, in particular, stressed that if such actions in violation of the UN Charter continue, then it will inevitably lead to chaos in international relations,” RIA news agency quoted the Kremlin as saying in a statement.   NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
