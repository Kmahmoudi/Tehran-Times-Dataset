TEHRAN – Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, says “there is no alternative” to the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Writing an article on the official website of the European Union on Friday, December 22, Borrell suggested that those oppose the revival of the JCPOA “simply fool themselves”. Borrell wrote the article after he travelled to Jordan to represent the EU in the second Baghdad Conference for Cooperation and Partnership. Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian also participated in the conference that was held on Tuesday. “I still believe that when it comes to nuclear non-proliferation, there is no alternative to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Those who think otherwise simply fool themselves,” noted Borrell who was accompanied by his deputy Enrique Mora in the trip to Jordan. He added, “This is why, as coordinator, I continue working towards restoring the JCPOA based on the results of the Vienna negotiations. I talked long with Minister Abdollahian about that. I also stressed that bringing the JCPOA back to life does not happen in a strategic vacuum. It is part, a key part, of a broader picture.”    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
