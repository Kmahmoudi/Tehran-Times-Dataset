Khaji said the Yemeni National Salvation Government remains committed to its commitments under the Stockholm agreement and is implementing it unilaterally.  He condemned the Saudi-led coalition’s failure to keep its side of the bargain under the deal, and expressed hope the international community will adopt measures for the accord to be revived and fully implemented. The Iranian envoy also appreciated efforts by the UN secretary general and his special envoy for Yemen to advance the peace plan in the Arab country. The Swedish official, for his part, said Tehran and Stockholm have a lot in common and have made attempts to contribute to a political settlement of the Yemen crisis.

The war on Yemen by Saudi Arabia and its allies was launched in March 2015. The goal of the war was to return to power the Riyadh-backed former regime of Mansour Hadi and defeat the Houthi Ansarullah movement that had taken control after the resignation of the previous government.
