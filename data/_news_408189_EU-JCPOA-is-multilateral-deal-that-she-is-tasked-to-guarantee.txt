EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Wednesday that the JCPOA, the official name for the nuclear deal between Iran and great powers, is a “multilateral agreement” and that she is tasked to guarantee its full implementation.
 Republican Donald Trump, who unexpectedly won the U.S. presidency on Tuesday, had argued during his campaigns that he would renegotiate the nuclear deal if he was elected president.  “The Iranian deal, the nuclear deal, is not a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Iran,” she said in an interview with CNN. “It’s a multilateral agreement that we have negotiated. I have a personal, direct responsibility as, still, the chair of the joint commission that supervises the implementation of the agreement, so guarantee that it is fully implemented by all sides – all sides – and this is enframed into a UN Security Council resolution, actually more than one,” she added. She said, “So it is not a bilateral or unilateral issue. It is a multilateral agreement in the framework of the UN.” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday that Iran wants all parties to stick to the international nuclear deal but has options if that does not happen. "Of course Iran's options are not limited but our hope and our desire and our preference is for the full implementation of the nuclear agreement, which is not bilateral for one side to be able to scrap," Zarif asserted Zarif in a news conference in Bratislava after meeting his Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajcak. Also on Wednesday Zarif said Trump must stick to international agreements including the nuclear deal which was reached in July 2015 and took effect in January 2016. President Hassan Rouhani also said on Wednesday that the election of Trump will have no effect on Iran’s behavior. The nuclear agreement that was signed between Iran, and six great powers - China, Russia, the U.S, Britain, France, and Germany – in July 2015 went into effect in January.  According to the JCPOA, Iran is tasked to limit its nuclear activities and instead sanctions against the country are removed.
