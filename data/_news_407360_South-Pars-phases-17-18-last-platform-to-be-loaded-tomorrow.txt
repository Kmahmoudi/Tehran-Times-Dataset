TEHRAN- Platform 17B of Iran’s South Pars gas field (in Persian Gulf) will be loaded at Bandar-Abbas yard tomorrow for delivery to its designated offshore spot, according to the Shana news agency.  The 2,300-ton structure is the last platform of South Pars phases 17 and 18 of development and has the capacity of producing 500 million cubic feet (around 14.5 million cubic meters) of gas per day. 
Hassan Boyeri, the operator of phases 17 and 18, said that the platform is scheduled to be installed on November 10 and will start operation before the beginning of the Iranian last calendar month of Esfand (February 19, 2017).
Development of phases 17 and 18 will be completed by putting this platform into operation, he added.
The mentioned phases are set to produce 56 million cubic meters of sweet gas, 80,000 barrels of gas condensate and 400 tons of sulfur per day in addition to one million tons of ethane and 1.05 million tons of propane and butane per annum.
South Pars gas field, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate.
The field is divided into 24 standard phases, of which phases 1-10, 12, 15 and 16 are fully operational. Each standard phase is projected to produce 50 mcm of gas per day. Phases 17 and 18 as well as 19 are operating at half capacity.  MA/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
