Certain U.S. officials, particularly President Donald Trump, have been trying hard to misuse the protest rallies in Iran. Through his repeated tweets, Trump has been lecturing about human rights since the protests started in Iran, saying, “The (Iranian) people have little food, big inflation and no human rights,” or “they are hungry for food & for freedom.”  The irony is that Trump has no respect for human rights and freedom.  Through his actions and words, the xenophobic president has proven that he just cares about money and tax break for the rich.   Contrary to the stupid U.S. president, civil protests in Iran date back to more than 100 years ago.  However, in the recent protests in the country, some hooligans are misusing the legitimate demands of people for better economic condition and campaign against corruption to create chaos, disorder and insecurity.   These violent protestors and Trump, who should now be considered allies, are derailing the demands of people for better living standards and transparency. Some of the protestors who are turning rallies into violent scenes are knowingly or unknowingly dancing to the tune of Trump, his inner circle, and the envious Saudi prince who is wishing Iran to degenerate into chaos. If Trump had been a defender of human rights he would not have declared al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel in violation of international law and a flagrant violation of the Palestinian people’s rights.  Trump is better to look at Saudi Arabia, a close Washington’s ally, whose people are brutally suppressed and nobody is allowed to make the slightest protest to the ruling family. It is also advisable that Trump ask Saudi Arabia, a country which he is milking through extremely lucrative arms deals, to respect the rights of Bahraini people that their pro-democracy movement has been brutally stifled by the invading Saudi army.   Moreover, it is better that the Trump administration stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia which is committing war crimes in Yemen and starved the entire nation. 
In view of these concrete examples it is advisable that Trump stop talking about human rights and freedom because he is alien to these notions. PA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
