TEHRAN - Israeli security officials have argued that the U.S. is interested in returning to the nuclear negotiations with Iran, making an estimate that a restoration of the 2015 nuclear deal would be feasible within few months despite recent footage circulating on social media in which President Joe Biden said the agreement was "dead". Based on a report published by the Hebrew newspaper Haaretz on Tuesday, the Tel Aviv security officials believe that the military leaders in the United States endorse revival of the nuclear agreement with Iran. However, it said, Iran's (alleged) support for Russia in the Ukraine war is regarded currently as the main obstacle.  The Israeli daily made an allegation that the Tel Aviv regime’s security service views Biden's statements about the death of the nuclear deal more as a "slip of the tongue" than as binding words. Haaretz pointed out that some officials in Israel’s spy agencies are also worried about an intensification of Iran's influence in some new regions in Wes Asia. Those officials, who preferred to be anonymous, allegedly said that Jordan is one of the countries where Iran's influence will be on the rise.  In another part of the report, it is also claimed by the security officials of the Zionist regime that the economic pressure on Iran as well as the disturbances in the country might bring Tehran back to the nuclear negotiations. The report said that the Zionist regime’s security officials have reached a consensus that Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 with the collusion of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a "strategic mistake". Some other sources in the Zionist regime’s intelligence apparatus pointed out that the abandonment of the JCPOA was proceeded without an alternative plan to deal with Iran's nuclear program.  According to the report, Iran is now in the best condition since it began working on the nuclear program.
