TEHRAN – Iran on Saturday dismissed as “politically motivated, unrealistic, exaggerated and counter constructive” a report by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom that said Iran is violating the rights of religious minorities.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran acknowledges the religious minorities’ rights based on its constitutional law. All the Iranian citizens are equal in enjoying their basic rights within the framework of law,” the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi explained. Qassemi said, “In the recent UN reports, concerns have been expressed about violation of religious minorities’ rights (in the U.S.) and it is essential for the U.S. government to pay attention to violation of the Muslims’ rights instead of advising other countries.” It is essential for the U.S. government to end violating the religious minorities’ rights especially the Muslims and be more committed to the human rights, Qassemi remarked. The Foreign ministry official added that the U.S. should adopt necessary strategies to stop spread of Islamophobia. Qassemi also said that Iran condemns any political exploitation under the pretext of human rights.
