The Leader said commitment, vigilance and ability to identify enemies are three characteristics the country's Air Force and other military institution must have. He warned against enemy's wide-scale cultural and political campaign to deprive the Iranian nation of these three key characteristics. The Leader made the remarks while addressing the Air Force personnel on the occasion of the Air Force Day, marking the historical meeting of Air Force personnel with the Father of the Islamic Revolution and Founder of the Islamic Republic the late Imam Khomeini in 1979. Ayatollah Khamenei said the February 7 event marks a great move and unforgettable and lasting event due to commitment of the faithful, revolutionary and devoted personnel of the Air Force as well as their alertness and ability to identify the enemy. Thanks to the Islamic Revolution and public uprising, Iran was freed from oppression, backwardness and humiliation as a result of foreigners' domination over the country, said the Leader, adding that therefore, the Iranian nation should always be thankful for its dignity. This year, contrary to the wide-scale propaganda campaign of the enemy against the Iranian nation, the late Imam Khomeini and the Islamic system, the Iranian nation would deal a heavy blow to enemies by massively taking part in the Bahman 22 (February 10) rallies, said the Leader. Touching on certain moves under way to insinuate that there is no enemy, the Leader said the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian people's steadfastness would deal deadliest blow to the interests of world devourers. "This is a solid evidence of the existence of enemies," added the Leader. The Supreme Leader also cautioned the audience against foreign media's political and publicity campaigns to mislead the public opinion and contaminate the cultural atmosphere of the country so that the country might miss opportunities and forget the demands of the time. The enemy efforts are aimed at preoccupying the public, said the Leader. Certain political groups, too, add fuel to the situation and act as the enemy's mouthpiece by launching political propaganda every now and then, regretted the Leader. Existence of committed and devoted youth and abundant facilities for activities inside the country heralds a good and brilliant future, said the paramount Leader, adding that enemy tries to disappoint the Iranian people in order to take away such a bright future from them. Any segment of the society should be self-reliant and move towards progress and development in light of its firm will and national manpower resources, concluded Ayatollah Khamenei.  (IRNA)
