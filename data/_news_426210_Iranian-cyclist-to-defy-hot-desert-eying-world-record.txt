TEHRAN – Iranian cyclist Hassan Khorashadi is slated to ride across Rig Yelan desert, deemed as one of the hottest spots on Earth, to try and set a Guinness World Record, Mehr reported on Saturday. The athlete is scheduled to try hand at trekking a 120-kilometer course on August 10 within a span of 12 hours when the temperature in the desert reaches over 60 degrees centigrade. Native of South Khorasan province, Khorashadi has been professionally cycling for 14 years, Mehr reported. “The impression of cycling across Earth’s hottest spot popped into my head in 2016 when I was traversing Lut Desert,” the athlete said. He also referred to measures to be taken to achieve the record, saying “My cycling marathon will be documented and submitted to Guinness authorities in order to be accessed to go on their records.” Other objective for the event is to promote the Lut Desert in an international scale, Khorashadi added. Rig Yelan is referred to some eastern parts of the UNESCO-registered Lut Desert which is rich in magnificent scenery and unparalleled serenity. Iranian deserts have always lured people who are in search of new adventures. Seven years of satellite temperature data analyzed by NASA has shown that the Lut Desert is the hottest spot on Earth. Based on the research, it was hottest during 5 of the 7 years, and had the highest temperature overall: 70.7°C in 2005.
