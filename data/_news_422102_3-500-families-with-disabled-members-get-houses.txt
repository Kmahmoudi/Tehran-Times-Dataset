TEHRAN — Some 3,500 Iranian families with two or more physically challenged members were provided houses during the current Iranian calendar year, the Welfare Organization director Anoushirvan Mohseni-Bandpey has said. The current year ends on March 20, 2018. Mohseni-Bandpey also said all families with two or more members with disabilities will be given houses by the end of the Iranian calendar year of 1398 (March 2020), the YJC said on Friday.  “More than 11,000 families with members suffering disabilities have registered for the housing scheme,” Mohseni-Bandpey explained.  Such families also receive 300-million-rial (nearly $6,500) handouts for buying houses, he concluded.  In January, Majlis [the Iranian parliament] approved both general outlines and details of a bill on rights of persons with disabilities. Development of disability-friendly cities, free transportation, health insurance, free education, job creation, housing loans, and less working hours are some of the articles of the law which are hoped to improve such groups’ living conditions in the near future.  MQ/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
