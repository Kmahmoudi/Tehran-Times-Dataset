TEHRAN – Golestan province’s governor has said that 200 eco-lodges will be opened to the public during the next couple of months to cater to the hospitality industry in northern Iran.  Many of the eco-lodges will be prepared by renovating and repurposing of historical houses, CHTN reported. “The architecture of the old houses in the area is unmatched by any others, which lays the ground for tourism development and attracting [more] travelers.” The lodging houses are expected to run by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019), the official stated. Earlier in June, Iran tourism chief Ali-Asghar Mounesan publicized that a total of 2,000 new eco-lodges are being made across the country.  AFM/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
