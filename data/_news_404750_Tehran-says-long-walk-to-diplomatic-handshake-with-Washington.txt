TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman has put the prospect of an all-out diplomatic thaw between Washington and Tehran too distant, citing numerous hurdles on the path to normalization.
 Bahram Qassemi made the remarks on Tuesday when asked by Kyodo news agency senior journalist Hiroki Sugita about the possibility that Iran and the U.S. open embassies in Washington and Tehran. “Naturally, there may have been some convergence on regional issues, but negotiations have been solely on the nuclear issue,” he said. Tehran and Washington have had no political exchange since November 1979 when the U.S. embassy in Tehran was stormed by a clutch of students on revelations it was used by Washington as an “espionage den”. To understand how long it takes for a thaw, the nuclear deal is a good yardstick, a point referred to by Qassemi. “The lengthy nuclear negotiations, as an example, can show how bumpy the path to establishing relations is and how long it takes to normalize ties.”  Unlike optimism about closer bonds in the wake of the successful nuclear deal, it will not be possible to bring down the wall of mistrust so easily. While Washington says it is open to a more democratic, secular Iran which respects human rights, Tehran characterizes the U.S. hostility toward the country as ideological in essence. Iran calls on Japanese firms to seize post-sanction opportunities Qassemi also called on Japanese companies to seize the opportunity to take part in joint ventures with Iran in the post-sanctions era. If Japanese firms hesitate to compete with European, South Korean and Chinese companies, they will lag behind, Qassemi remarked, the Foreign Ministry said on its website. Since Iran is the most secure country in the Middle East, it is a good choice for foreign investors, including Japan, the spokesman said. Iran has a “strategic look” towards the East and it depends on Japanese companies and officials to take a timely decision, he added. Iran can choose its partners, Qassemi noted.
