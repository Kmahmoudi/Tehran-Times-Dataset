TEHRAN – Former defense minister said on Wednesday that Iran should be among the top five countries in the world in terms of defense capability. Brigadier General Amir Vahidi stressed that Iran should become so powerful that no country dares to violate the rights of the oppressed and Muslims across the globe, ISNA reported. He then pointed to the plight of the Rohingya Muslims who have been forced out of their homes in Myanmar. “Is what we’re witnessing in Myanmar acceptable?” he asked empathically.
