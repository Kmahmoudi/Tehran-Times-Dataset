TEHRAN – Presidential candidate Ebrahim Raisi has said he will use women in his cabinet if he becomes president.
 Speaking on Wednesday, he criticized “some who make profit even through the shadow of war,” Fars reported. “They are the ones who also talk about concerts in order to refrain from mentioning the Crescent deal,” Raisi stated. He also said that as custodian of the Holy Shrine of Imam Reza, most of the letters he received from ordinary people were about unemployment. SP/AK
