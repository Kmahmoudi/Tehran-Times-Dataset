Population ageing is one of the major demographic transitions globally, especially in the Asia and Pacific as one of the most populated areas in the world. The speed and scope of population ageing as well as its profound implications for socio-economic development, call for immediate action at different levels particularly at the level of policy formulation and planning.   Most countries in the region are advancing in adapting policies and practices to the demands of rapid population ageing. Some of these countries are more ahead in this process i.e.; Thailand, Vietnam, Republic of Korea, Japan while others are at different stages of policy development. Given that, exchanging knowledge and experiences among these countries is essential, to better grasp potential solutions to the issues related to population ageing and the needs of older people.Â  In this context, the Government of Iran in collaboration with United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Asia and Pacific Regional Office of the HelpAge International held a regional forum on policy implications of population ageing in July 2017 in Tabriz. This forum mainly aimed at facilitating exchange of knowledge and expertise among these countries, and to contribute to the process of policy formulation and came to an end with endorsement of a statement. As a follow-up to Tabriz forum, this year, in partnership with the UNFPA, the Ministry of Cooperative, Labor and Welfare, the State Welfare Organization of Islamic Republic of Iran, the HelpAge Asia-Pacific Regional Conference will be held in Tehran from October 23 to 25. HelpAge International in Asia-Pacific has been holding regular regional conferences on ageing for the last 20 years. Previous conferences have taken place in India (2006), Indonesia (2008), Australia (2010), Myanmar (2012), Thailand (2014) and Vietnam (2016). The conference is also being supported by Age International and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). UNFPA Executive Director and Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Dr. Natalia Kanem, high level Iranian officials, foreign missions representatives as well as 121 delegates from 28 countries including government ministers, non-government and civil society organizations, academics and researchers, and members of the media will attend the conference.
