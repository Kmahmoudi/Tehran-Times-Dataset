TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani has said that the Islamic Republic system is “united” and there is no division between the Supreme Leader and heads of the three branches of government.
 “The system is united and the enemies will take the wish of division among the (executive, legislative and judicial) powers and Leadership to grave,” Rouhani said in a speech at the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini late on Thursday. He also called “Islamic Revolution”, “Islamic Republic” and “rule of supreme jurisprudence” legacies of the late Imam Khomeini. He highlighted the importance of guarding the Islamic Revolution as a “legacy” of Imam Khomeini. “We are proud of the Islamic Revolution and revolutionary spirit of the Iranian nation and we will spare no effort in defending the evolutionary path of this revolution,” he told the people who had congregated at the shrine of Imam Khomeini. Imam Khomeini was the architect of the Islamic Republic system which can be a model for other countries, he noted. Elsewhere, Rouhani said that the Islamic Revolution bears the messages of “freedom”, “independence” and “belief in religion”. He also said all are duty bound to boost the efficiency of the system. Pointing to the volatile situation in the Middle East region, he said the peace and stability in Iran is a result of the Leader’s effective role in maintaining and boosting national integrity and unity. On Wednesday, Rouhani said that the goals set by Imam Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, are strongly and perfectly followed by his successor Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
