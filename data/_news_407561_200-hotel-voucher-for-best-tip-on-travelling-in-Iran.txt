TEHRAN - Travelers to Iran would have a chance of winning a £200 hotel voucher for tips on specific places and experiences during their stay in the ancient country. The Guardian has issued a public call, inviting tourists who have been either on a guided cultural tour of the country’s cities, skiing or hiking trips, or the sole travels to Iran to try their luck at earning a £200 voucher from uk.hotels.com if they share their tips on the ancient land. “Iran is no longer forbidden territory for Western travelers and offers amazingly varied scenery, history and culture. We want to hear about the country’s splendors – you may have relatives in the country and have been taken to various sights or you may have been on a guided hiking and cultural trip,” the daily announced on Wednesday. The paper clearly specifies that is looking for tips on specific places and experiences rather than whole regions or cities, saying “so tell us about the great places you’ve stayed at and visited with as much detail as you can (including website and prices etc., if possible) in around 100 words.” Contributors are welcomed if add a photo but however it is the text which will be judged and chosen by Tom Hall of the Lonely Planet, a famous travel website. According to the Guardian, a collection of best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the winner will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com, allowing him or her to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide. The submissions will be accepted until Wednesday, October 26, 10 a.m. GMT. “Iran is being turned into a major tourism destination for European travelers,” said Elzbieta Bienkowska, the European Union commissioner for industry and entrepreneurship, during her Tehran visit last week. Iran expects to reap a bonanza from its numerous natural beauties and tourist sites, 21 of which have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, after implementation of the nuclear deal in January 2016. About sixteen million tourists have visited the country over the past three years, fetching nearly $24 billion in revenues, according to formal statistics by Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization.   The undated picture above depicts nature lovers trek on the Valley of Stars on the vast Iranian Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf in an undated photo. The valley is composed of marl and sandstone, and the rock formations vary from tall pillars, creating canyon-like paths, to hollowed-out spaces and smooth, round stones.
