TEHRAN -- Legendary Iranian vocalist Shahram Nazeri and the Kamkars performed a joint fundraising concert for the victims of the devastating earthquake in their homeland of Kermanshah at the Grand Hall of the Interior Ministry in Tehran on Monday.

 Addressing the audience, Nazeri praised the Iranian people for their solidarity with those who lost their homes and loved ones in the region, which is home to a portion of the Iranian Kurdish people. “Kurdish people enjoy a culture, which has sorrow, epics, battles and celebration all together,” he said and added, “They have saved many venerable traditions and have been the preservers of many things for years.” Nazeri also noted that he and his group did not have much time to rehearse for the concert, which featured a mixture of both happy and sad songs. Actress Roya Nonahali was also invited to appear on stage and delivered a short speech, remembering those who lost their lives, and lauding those who have stayed bravely to celebrate life in the aftermath of the devastating quake. Cartoonist and graphic designer Bozorgmehr Hosseinpur also attended the concert, creating a black and white drawing to put on sale for the benefit of those affected by the earthquake.
