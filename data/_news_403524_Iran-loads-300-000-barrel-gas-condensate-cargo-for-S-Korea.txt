Iran loaded a gas condensate cargo of 300,000 barrels from the phase 19 of its South Pars gas field on Saturday for shipment to South Korea, the Shana news agency reported. TEHRAN-South Korea’s media in April quoted informed industry sources as saying that the country intends to more than double its imports of crude oil and gas condensate from Iran. The sources that were not named emphasized that the policy is meant to ramp up energy ties with the Islamic Republic.
South Korea’s imports of Iranian crude oil jumped around 130 percent in May from the same month a year ago, extending gains after international sanctions were lifted in January on Iran’s nuclear program.
Seoul brought in 1.26 million tons of Iranian crude oil last month, or 297,625 barrels per day (bpd), compared with 541,510 tons imported a year ago, customs data showed. MA
