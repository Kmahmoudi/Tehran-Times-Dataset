TEHRAN - Intelligence Minister Seyyed Mahmoud Alavi said on Monday that the Rouhani government shows no hesitation in cracking down on financial corruption immediately after noticing it. “We (at the Intelligence Ministry) have the responsibility to fight massive economic corruption based on the Leader’s remarks and the minor issues are upon the other bodies such as the Supreme Auditing Court and the State Inspectorate Organization,” Alavi said during a meeting with Hojatoleslam Seyyed Ahmad Alamolhoda, the Friday prayer leader of Mashhad. It is necessary to fight corruption if the public trust in the performance of officials is not going to be undermined, Alavi noted. So far, he said, the Intelligence Ministry has fulfilled its duties in the best way in this regard. Alamolhoda praised efforts being made by the Intelligence Ministry in line with maintaining the country’s security.
