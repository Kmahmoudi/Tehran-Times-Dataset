TEHRAN – Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani has strongly condemned the “criminal” and “inhumane” Israeli acts against peaceful Palestinian protesters on Land Day. “Such acts are the continuation of the Zionists’ repeated crimes (against Palestinians) under the support of the U.S. administration,” Larijani said on Sunday, Tasnim reported. He further described the Israeli regime’s policy of creating tension in the region as well as U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to move his country’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (al-Quds) as plots orchestrated by Tel Aviv and Washington to undermine the region’s security and stability.
