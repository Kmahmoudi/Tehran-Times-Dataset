TEHRAN- According to a senior Russian diplomat, his "constructive" discussions on topics of mutual interest with his Iranian and Chinese counterparts are an indication of the creation of a new triangle in international diplomacy. "Productive trilateral meetings on areas of mutual interest were held by the permanent delegations of China, Iran, and Russia," Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, said in a tweet on Thursday. "Doesnâ€™t it look like a new triangular in multilateral diplomacy- #China, #Iran and #Russia?" the top Russian diplomat tweeted, emphasizing that such a format "can easily enlarge." Many states support multilateralism and reject unilateralism, Ulyanov continued. "There are many (if not majority of) states who are in favor of multilateralism and against attempts to keep unilateral world alive at all costs," he said. Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, Leader of the Islamic Revolution, has stressed the importance of continuing with efforts to neutralize the sanctions and combat U.S. unilateralism since the United States withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Donald Trump left the agreement with the intention of suffocating the Iranian economy. To offset sanctions, Iran has attempted to pursue an economic policy that is oriented toward the East by strengthening its connections with its neighbors and other Asian nations and working toward self-sufficiency in a number of crucial areas. In spite of the U.S.'s unilateral sanctions, Iran and China inked a historic 25-year comprehensive strategic partnership in March 2021. The agreement formalizes the Sino-Iranian Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which was launched in 2016 during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Tehran. It lays forth the framework for the two nations' collaboration over the next 25 years in the areas of politics, culture, security, defense, and regional and international affairs. A twenty-year strategic partnership agreement between Iran and Russia is also being formulated. It would spell out a plan for future relations to grow on all fronts, ranging from politics to economy and security as well.
