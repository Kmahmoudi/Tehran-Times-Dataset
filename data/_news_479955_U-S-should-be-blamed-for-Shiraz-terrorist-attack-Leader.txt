TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, said Tuesday that part of the blame should go to the United States for the October 26 terrorist attack that took place in Shiraz. Ayatollah Khamenei received members of the families of the victims of the Daesh-claimed terrorist attack. In the meeting, the Leader commented on the Shiraz attack and those who stood behind it.  During this meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei announced that even though this tragic event has caused hearts to grieve, it is an event that will remain permanently in Iran’s history. He emphasized that the terrorist attack has disgraced those who were working behind the scenes of this evil act, referring to the spiteful Americans who are the creators of the Daesh terrorist group. “Cultural and artistic institutions need to pay attention to this event in the same way that they give attention to the Ashura tragedy and other historical events. They need to pass these on to future generations,” the Leader said, according to a readout of the meeting put out by khamenei.ir.  The Leader considered the assassination of the pilgrims in the Shah Cheragh Shrine to be different from other terrorist attacks, stating that it has added to the enemy’s disgrace. “In addition to the murderers and traitors, the main backers and creators of Daesh are also partners in this crime. They lie so much, they are so black-hearted, disgraceful, and hypocritical that they raise the flag of human rights with their words, but in practice, they create dangerous terrorist groups,” he noted.  The Leader of the Islamic Revolution called on cultural and media organizations to produce works of art showing this tragedy and other historical events. He emphasized, “In terms of the media and exposing events, we have had shortcomings in relating events, the history of the Islamic Revolution, and the enemies’ crimes to such an extent that the younger generation does not have much information about past events, including the crimes committed by the MEK [terrorists].” Ayatollah Khamenei firmly stated that explaining the facts about these events is one of the responsibilities of those who are active in the fields of arts, spreading information, and writing as well as cultural institutions. The Shiraz attack took place on October 26 at Maghrib prayer time, when a terrorist opened fire at the pilgrims with his AK-47 rifle, killing at least 13 people and injuring dozens of others. The attack prompted national grief and sorrow amid a wave of unrest. Daesh terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence has announced that it busted a group of 26 terrorists in relation to the Shiraz attack that was led by an Azerbaijani national. The ministry said it detained 26 terrorists who were involved or planning to carry out terrorist attacks across Iran, including Zahedan. “All the individuals arrested are non-Iranian and hold Azerbaijani, Tajik, and Afghan citizenship,” the ministry said in a statement.  It also said that the mastermind behind the Shiraz attack who coordinated it is an Azerbaijani national.
