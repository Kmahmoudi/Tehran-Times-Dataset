TEHRAN — Heavy snow has covered the Iranian capital, Tehran, and other cities in 17 provinces across the country.   Snow began falling on Friday in western provinces and reached central regions by Saturday night, causing disruption in road and air transport. East and West Azarbaijan, Ardabil, Zanjan, Alborz and Tehran provinces were swept by snow over the past two days. Some high-altitude regions are buried in more than 1.5 meters of snow. Schools and universities of most snow-hit provinces were closed on Saturday and Sunday. Even government offices were shut down in Alborz province on Sunday. Power cuts were also reported in some neighborhoods of Tehran province. All flights were cancelled in both Tehran’s Imam Khomeini and Mehrabad international airports until further notice.   Photo by Tasnim/Mohammad Ali Marizad Thousands of cars got stuck and were unable to move on Tehran-Karaj highway, western Tehran, on Saturday night. One of the passengers told the Tehran Times that he had reached his home in Karaj after going through 12 hours of standstill traffic. “Many cars have run out of gas,” he regretted.

Salimi has added that rescue teams were doubled to handle the situation.
