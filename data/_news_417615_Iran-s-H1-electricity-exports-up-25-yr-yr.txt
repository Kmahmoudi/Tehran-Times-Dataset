TEHRAN-Iran's exports of electricity to its neighboring countries increased by 25 percent in the first six months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-September 22) compared to the same period last year. According to Hooshang Falahatian, the deputy energy minister, Iran exported 5.162 million Kilowatt hours (mkwh) of electricity during the first half of the current year compared to the last year’s 4.146 mkwh. “Iran exchanges energy with its neighbors namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Iraq, as well as the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic among which Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan are only importers of Iran’s electricity,” Falahatian said. The official further noted that Iraq has settled a part of its dues to Iran and the rest will be paid in time. Last January, Iran halted electricity supplies to Iraq because of the outstanding arrears, which have piled up to more than $1 billion. Iran’s electricity export revenues reached $3.373 billion from August 2013 up to May 2017 during which the country exported 40.120 billion kilowatt hours of electricity to the neighboring countries.
