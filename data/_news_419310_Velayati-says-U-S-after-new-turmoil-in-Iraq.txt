TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a top advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, warned on Wednesday that the United States is again pursuing plots to foment insecurity in Syria and Iraq again. “The U.S. is after turmoil again in Syria and Iraq, especially in Raqqa,” Velayati said, emphasizing that there’s no need for the U.S. presence in the region, Fars news agency reported. “Certainly, the Syrian government and people and the resistance front will force the Americans to leave those regions in Syria which have been occupied by them,” he said.
