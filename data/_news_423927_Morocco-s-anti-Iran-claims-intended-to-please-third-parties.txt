TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman has dismissed the anti-Iran claims by Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita, who had accused Iran of interference in his country. In a Thursday statement, Bahram Qassemi said the Moroccan officials’ insistence on repeating false claims are merely a pretext to cut diplomatic relations with Iran and appease third parties. “The Moroccan foreign minister knows very well that the allegations are totally wrong and based on fantasies written by those who make such provocative moves based on their illegitimate interests and do not care about the real interests of the Moroccan people,” Qassemi said.
