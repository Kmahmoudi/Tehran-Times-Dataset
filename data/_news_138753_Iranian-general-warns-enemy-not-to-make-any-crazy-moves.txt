“Now, Iran’s defensive abilities are incomparable to the time of the Sacred Defense (1980-88 Iran-Iraq war),” Salehi said at a ceremony held for inaugurating the new projects of army ground forces. The Iranian military has developed a new air defense system with a boosted ability to hit targets by firing two missiles simultaneously, AFP quoted Iranian state radio as saying. “This new air defense system which can shoot one or two missiles simultaneously... has been designed by army ground forces and tested successfully,” the radio said. “It has high mobility and flexibility, and can pursue aerial targets in any climate. Simultaneous firing increases the chances of defense missiles hitting” their targets, it added.
