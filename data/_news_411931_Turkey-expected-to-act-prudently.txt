TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Monday that Tehran expects the Turkish government to be considerate in making comments and adopting stances.
 Iran practiced “self-restraint” towards some comments made by the Turkish government, he said in a press conference. Last month, in successive comments, the Turkish prime minister and foreign minister accused Iran of pursuing a sectarian policy in the region.
 
Larijani also said that asking the Iranians to avoid taking unnecessary trips to Turkey does not mean Tehran intends to undermine relations. Such action was taken to protect the people’s lives, he added. Larijani called Turkey a friendly country to Iran and expressed hope that terrorist acts would not happen in the country anymore. Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday issued a statement warning Iranians about traveling to Turkey. The statement which was published on the ministry’s official website urges citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to Turkey during the upcoming Nowruz holidays. “Considering the security conditions in Turkey in recent months and concerns for safety of Iranian citizens, all Iranians who intend to visit Turkey are strongly recommended to avoid making unnecessary trips and take all necessary measures if the visit is unavoidable,” the statement read. ‘Saudi Arabia should change its behavior’ Larijani also said that Saudi Arabia should change its behavior after two years of war against Yemen, noting that it is not good for Saudi Arabia to send a violent image of itself to the world. He also indirectly signaled that Tehran seeks good ties with Saudi Arabia, saying Iran’s general strategy is to have good relations with the Islamic countries. The parliament speaker also said that he will not be involved in the presidential rivalries in favor of or against a particular candidate. It is not in the interests of the legislative branch to involve itself in elections, Larijani remarked. Commenting on the potential candidacy of Ebrahim Raisi, the custodian of Astan Quds Razavi, Larijani said in his opinion Raisi does not need to resign from his current post. ‘Nuclear deal was a good decision’ Larijani also defended the nuclear deal, saying that signing of the agreement and its implementation were good decisions, however more precautionary actions should have been taken to avoid recent “mischievous” acts by the U.S. The nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was reached in July 2015 and went into effect in January 2016.  NA/PA
