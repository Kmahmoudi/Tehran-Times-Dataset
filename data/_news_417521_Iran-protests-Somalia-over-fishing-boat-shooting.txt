TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Wednesday strongly criticized Somalia for opening fire on an Iranian fishing boat, which killed the captain of the vessel and injured a sailor. “Iran has conveyed its protest to Somalia in this regard through relevant channels,” Qassemi told ISNA. He added that the ministry was following up on the case. The incident occurred last week when Somali security forces opened fire on the vessel during an operation in the Indian Ocean.
