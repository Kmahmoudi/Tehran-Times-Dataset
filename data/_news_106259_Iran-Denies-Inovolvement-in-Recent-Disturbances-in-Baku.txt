Following the recent disturbances in Baku, a number of party officials, representatives of Azerbaijan National Assembly (Milli Majlis) and mass media, in a subversive move, accused Iran of interference in the event and charged some of the opposition party leaders with spying for Iran. The statement added that, as the police and security forces as well as other Azeri officials are aware, such groups are financed by the countries which are constantly visited by the group leaders and whose representatives and envoys even stay there. "A number of the mentioned Azeri officials and their affiliated agents have been gathering in front of Iran`s Embassy in Baku on various pretexts to voice their opposition to Iran. "Even the media affiliated to such groups constantly insult the senior Iranian authorities. A look at the archive of such media will reveal that they have not spared any effort to disrupt relations between Iran and Azerbaijan," added the statement. The statement further said that Iran has not supported any of the candidates. It added that once the presidential elections were over, Iran was the first state to congratulate the victory of Ilham Aliyev.
