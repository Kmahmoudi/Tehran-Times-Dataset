TEHRAN – Iraq is preparing infrastructure to receive Iranian natural gas in its southern city of Basra within two months, IRIB news reported quoting the National Iranian Gas Company’s managing director.
 Iran has agreed to export up to 25 million cubic meters of gas to Basra as soon as Iraq is ready. “Everything is ready on our part, we are prepared to start the exports as soon as the Iraqi side finishes infrastructure preparations,” Hamidreza Araqi said. According to Shana, Iran exported 1.2 billion cubic meters of gas to Iraq since June 2017 up to November 2017. The two countries initially signed a deal in 2013 for Iran to supply Iraqi power plants, but officials in the past blamed poor security in Iraq for hampering implementation. EF/MA
