The Yemeni Army launched missile attacks against Saudi military positions in the kingdom’s southwestern city of Jizan in retaliation of recent massacre of civilians in Sana’a by the Saudi-led coalition, Yemeni sources said on Tuesday. The Yemeni Army fired ballistic missiles at a Saudi military base in al-Hamra hill in Jizan, killing and injuring dozens of the Saudi-led forces in the base, Yemeni sources said, according to the Arabic-language Al-Manar TV. Following the missile attack, Saudi ambulances were dispatched to the area to take the injured to hospitals. Up to now, there has been no report on the exact number of casualties of the missile attack. The attack came after more than 140 Yemeni people were killed and over 525 wounded on Saturday, when a Saudi airstrike hit a community hall in southern Sana’a, where a funeral for the father of Interior Minister Jalal al-Roweishan was being held. The Saudi missiles tore through the hall with hundreds of body parts left strewn in and outside the building. The death toll was one of the largest in a single incident since March 2015, when the Riyadh regime began its deadly campaign to crush the Houthis and their allies and restore power to resigned president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Sana’a Mayor Abdel Qader Hilal was reported to be among the victims of Saturday’s assault. Yemeni Armed Forces Spokesman Brigadier General Sharaf Qaleb Luqman had pledged that the Arabian Peninsula country’s forces would respond by conducting unprecedented attacks.
