He said the OIC is for a "re-invent" to meet the challenges of the 21st century when its leaders meet in Malaysia in October. "The OIC must change to meet the challenges faced by Islamic countries, coming from within and without," he said. Syed Hamid said this at a press conference after the meeting with visiting OIC secretary-general Dr Abdelouahed Belkeziz. On the focus of the summit, he said that deliberations would not focus on Iraq or peace efforts in Palestine per se but would include all issues that affected the ummah,IRNA reported. "We will reiterate the need for peace and security, we will highlight our concerns over unilateralism, concerns over the stereotyping of Muslims as perpetrators of violence and terrorism as well as other issues," he said. Syed Hamid was also asked about the possibility of Malaysia submitting its candidate for the post of OIC secretary-general. He said Kuala Lumpur was encouraged that many OIC countries were keen to see Malaysia nominate a candidate for the job which falls vacant next year. "But we have not decided whether or not to submit a candidate," he said, adding that his ministry had not started anything in that direction. At the end of the ruling United Malaysia National Organisation (UMNO) general assembly last week, Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, deemed by many to be a suitable candidate due to the respect he commands in the Muslim world, said that he was not keen on taking up the post. Malaysia's first prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra A-Haj, was the OIC's first secretary-general, holding the post from 1971 to 1973. Syed Hamid said the mere fact that the OIC groups 57 member states of different experiences is already an achievement, but "we must now rise to the challenges of democracy, globalisation and technology." Syed Hamid said, "I think OIC is still (relevant); despite its many weaknesses has some degree of influence. So, we will have to work on how to strengthen the OIC." With this in mind, he added, Malaysia has chosen "Knowledge and morality" as the theme of the foreign ministers' conference. He said the agenda to be put forward during ministerial interactive session will be discussing on the main theme of knowledge and morality, the subject of unity and dignity and the rest will discuss on restructuring and reform of the OIC -- based on the report done by the consultant. Syed Hamid said the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) will also be discussed at the meeting,IRNA reported. He stressed that Muslims worldwide are suffering because certain parties were linking Islam with terrorists and terrorism in the wake of the September 11th attacks on New York and Washington. "We want this mind-setting and stereotyping about terrorism being synonymous or equal to Islam be rid off because now the Muslims all over the world are suffering," he said this in the reply to the question by IRNA on the view that terrorism as synonymous with Islam. Syed Hamid said the issue of terrorism would have to be viewed in the context of bringing about a settlement to the Southwest Asian conflict and the Palestinian problem. He said OIC Summit to be hosted by Malaysia in October would go on as scheduled. Commenting on the rumours, Syed Hamid said that indications he received were that the OIC member countries were looking forward to attending the gathering. He described rumours, aimed at derailing the planned summit, as "irresponsible". The minister added that it has become imperative for Muslim countries to work at projecting the correct image of Islam away from the trend to associate it with poverty, illiteracy and backwardness. Syed Hamid said that with the wealth and the abundance in natural and human resources which the Islamic countries could harness, the OIC could be an important element of global power. Meanwhile, Dr Belkeziz expressed admiration over Malaysia's preparation for the summit which will take place at the brand new RM650 million (US$171 million) Putrajaya Convention Centre which he visited Wednesday. Dr Belkeziz said he was hopeful that the summit would be a landmark in the OIC's history and that it would result in important decisions for the good of the Islamic ummah. The Marrakech-born Dr Belkeziz, who was appointed OIC secretary-general in 2001 arrived here on Tuesday and will be in the country until Saturday. He also confirmed that the OIC's 10th summit will take place as scheduled in Malaysia in October.
