TEHRAN – Agents with Saudi Arabia and the Zionist regime were killed in Iran’s September 9 missile attacks against the Kurdistan Democratic Party – Iran (KDP-I) terrorist group in the Iraqi Kurdistan region, commander of the IRGC aerospace division announced on Wednesday. Hailing Iran’s missile power in targeting the terrorists, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh said, “Today, instead of sending fighter jets to locations of the operations, we target the meeting room of the leaders of Daesh (ISIS) with precision from 700 kilometers away.” “All of these show our intelligence and military might,” Hajizadeh added, Tasnim reported. The general also said since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year about 80 operations plotted by terrorist groups to destabilize Iran have been neutralized.  The Iranian year started on March 21, 2018.
