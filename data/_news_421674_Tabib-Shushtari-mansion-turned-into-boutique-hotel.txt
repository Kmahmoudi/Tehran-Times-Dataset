TEHRAN – The 19th-century Tabib Shushtari mansion has recently been repurposed into a boutique hotel after being fully restored. The mansion is located in the ancient city of Shushtar, southwest Iran. “Being the first traditional residence in Shushtar, it has 10 rooms with a capacity to accommodate 39 people …. a considerable feature of the place is its vicinity to the UNESCO-inscribed Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System,” CHTN quoted Alireza Tabib Shushrari, its landlord, as saying on Tuesday. Earlier this month, the Revitalization and Utilization Fund for Historical Places announced 269 historical monuments across the country are to be ceded to the private sector with the aim of repurposing them into eco-lodges or other profitable niches. Iran is home to abundant historical mansions, caravanserais, bathhouses, madrasas, and other massive monuments, which can buttress its budding tourism and hospitality sectors if managed appropriately and refurbished properly.
