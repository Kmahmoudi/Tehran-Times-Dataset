TEHRAN – Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum announced on Friday it is ready to cooperate with the Judiciary to return the $3.8 billion that Babak Zanjani owes to the national treasury. One of Iran's richest men, Zanjani was arrested in December 2013 and was accused of withholding $2.7 billion of government money owned by the Ministry of Petroleum. He was sentenced to death in March 2016 over a number of charges including forgery, money laundering and disrupting the country’s economy. According to a statement issued by the ministry, less than $600 million of Zanjani’s debts to the government has been paid back. “We are trying to cooperate with the Judiciary as well as the convict to identify his assets overseas and return them to the country,” it said. The ministry cast doubts on Zanjani’s repeated empty promises, saying, “He has stated that his overseas partners are ready to pay $2 billion of his debts.”  A bitter controversy has erupted recently over the Zanjani case. Days ago, President Hassan Rouhani demanded more decisiveness on the part of the Judiciary in fighting corruption. “The public still awaits persuasive answers to many questions in Judiciary’s handling of the corruption; Mr. Zanjani has received a sentence but the demanding question should still be answered why an individual should be given such scope of activity and opportunity to have access to and handle huge sums of money just through his links to some important officials in the (previous) government; the stolen money should be returned to the public purse; this is a public demand that should be addressed above all other considerations,” Rouhani stated. His remarks received severe rebuke from Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani, who said the Judiciary is determined to pursue the Zanjani case and fight corruption. On Thursday, the Ministry of Intelligence said it had provided the Judiciary with a list of companies and individuals involved in the Zanjani case. It also published a list of assets held by Zanjani overseas, including large quantities of gold, cars, and dozens of companies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said on Thursday that it has always cooperated with the Judiciary on the Zanjani case, emphasizing that pursuing the case through international channels is very difficult, since the convict’s activities have been “fraudulent, unofficial and stealthy.” “Maybe that’s why the Foreign Ministry has never been asked to pursue the issue directly,” it said. “No information regarding the case has been given to the Foreign Ministry, because essentially entering into such areas is beyond the conventional responsibilities of every Foreign Ministry.”  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
