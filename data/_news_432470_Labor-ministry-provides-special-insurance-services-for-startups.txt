TEHRAN –Cooperatives, Labor, and Social Welfare Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari has said the ministry provides special insurance services for startups and innovative firms. The ministry is providing infrastructure for special insurance services for those who are active in startups and knowledge-based companies, Shariatmadari told IRNA on Sunday. The ministry is responsible for solving problems and challenges between cooperatives, traditional jobs and startups, he explained. He said that the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure will lead to problems between traditional and online taxi services or the employment offices affiliated to labor ministry and some job and employment websites.  The ministry aims to develop infrastructures for knowledge-based fields in order to make appropriate policies for social problems, he said. There are only 250 startups and knowledge-based cooperatives, which is a very small number out of the total number of 90,000 cooperatives in Iran, he said.
