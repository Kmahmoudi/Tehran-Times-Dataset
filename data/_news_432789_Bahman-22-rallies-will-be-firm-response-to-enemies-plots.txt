TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that the nation’s huge turnout in the Bahman 22 rallies (Feb. 11) marking the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution will be an “overwhelming response” to the enemies’ plots. The Bahman 22 rallies this year are of special importance as Iran has come under renewed, toughest, and illegal sanctions by the U.S. and Donald Trump’s national security advisor John Bolton had said that the Islamic Revolution will not see its 40th anniversary. In remarks after cabinet session, Rouhani also criticized the Trump administration for its disrespectful attitude toward the Iranian nation, saying everyone knows the problems facing the region and the world are the results of America’s interference and its unwelcome presence in the region. The Bahman 22 rallies will fall on Monday. Rouhani added, “The regional nations are well aware that Iran has always helped with the peace and stability in the region.”  Mentioning the atrocities committed by the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK) terrorist organization in the wake of the Islamic Revolution, the president said the MEK’s sponsors were the Americans and Zionists. “Iran is a victim of terrorism,” he said, adding, “Iran and Iranians have always taken a firm stance against terrorism.” While America has always been a troublemaker for the region and the world, the Islamic Iran, on the other hand, has been the solution, he argued. Rouhani added that Iran will continue making every effort to establish peace and security in the region, especially in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. He also pointed to Washington’s interference in Latin American countries, citing Venezuela as an example.
