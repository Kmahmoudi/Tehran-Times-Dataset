TEHRAN – A total of 21 luxurious trains with foreign sightseers aboard have toured Iran over the past three years and a new one will arrive in the country in October, an official with the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways said on Friday. The landmark nuclear deal in July 2015 between Iran and the six world powers has opened up a new chapter in tourism influx to the country. “21 foreign tourist trains have entered Iran throughout the past three years and a 22nd is scheduled to come in October,” IRNA quoted Ali Kazemimanesh as saying. Each of the trains are equipped with large and sophisticated cars carrying 80 passengers on average, the official added.  The Golden Eagle Luxury Trains is amongst long-distance rail tour operators to the country that offers exclusive itineraries between Moscow and Tehran and vice versa under the name “Persian Odyssey.” The company also operates another prestigious tour titled “Heart of Persia” that commences and ends in Tehran. The 14-day voyage explores so many of Iran’s remarkable sites and incredibly scenic landscapes. Abundant from corner to corner with ancient bazaars, museums, mosques, monuments, gardens and palaces set inside bustling cities, historical ruins and rich rural landscapes, Iran is increasingly filled with camera-wielding foreign travelers seeking adventure, archeology and art.
