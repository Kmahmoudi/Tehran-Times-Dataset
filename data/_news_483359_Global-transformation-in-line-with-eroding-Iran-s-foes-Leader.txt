TEHRAN- Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei on Tuesday underlined that the world is encountering a substantial political transformation, meaning that status of the world order is changing which such a discourse is heard from various places.  The Leader made the comments while speaking at a meeting with the heads of the three branches of the government, current and former government officials, a number of senior managers of various organizations, parliamentarians, and active members of various social and cultural organizations in the Imam Khomeini Hosseiniyeh on the 13th day of the holy month of Ramadan.    “I am willing to say that this global transformation is fortunately aimed at debilitating the nemesis of the Islamic Republic. This is an important phenomenon. Changes are taking place so fast. Given the foreign policy, we need to step up our activities as well as initiatives. It is the time to take advantage of the opportunity,” the Leader noted.  Regarding the Zionist regime, the Leader emphasized that “I have [already] said the Zionist regime will fail to see another 25 years, but they are in a hurry and want to leave sooner.” Ayatollah Khamenei also hailed the holy month of Ramadan, calling it “the month of remembrance.”  “Do not lose this month easily because people’s hearts are ready to receive divine lights, divine guidance, divine blessings, and divine mercy,” he remarked.  To curb the inflation and lay the grounds for economic growth, according to the Leader, first up, it is momentous that all departments and institutions of the country find such a need as a top priority, indicating that all endeavors should be concentrated on this focal point in the current year, which began on March 21.  Ayatollah Khamenei has selected "inflation control and growth in production" as the name of the new calendar year.  “The livelihood of people is regarded as the most important issue of Iran,” he pointed out, adding that the “stability” in policies and economic decisions is vital for the implementation of the current year’s slogan.  The Leader also said that “it should not be like that such a topic is discussed over and over but gradually fades away.” “However, this year’s slogan should never stop at the end of the year but instead it needs to linger for the years to come but this year’s slogan should be the focus of all efforts in the three branches (of government) and other sectors until the end of the year,” Ayatollah Khamenei emphasized. Given the economic issues, Ayatollah Khamenei pointed out that “economy is the top issue of the country. People’s livelihood is the most important issue of the country as well.” “The fact that I made the slogans economic does not indicate that cultural and social issues should be missed. They are also important in their own place, but a disordered economy also affects the culture of society,” he remarked.  The Leader went on to say that it is a fact that “we have had high inflation for several years in a row. This impinges on the income distribution system of the country. In other words, the distribution of the country’s income is unbalanced, some people remain deprived, and some people now have their pockets filled in various ways. It foments corruption from both sides.” Ayatollah Khamenei also noted that there are numerous capacities in Iran which some of them are hardware. On the other hand, he said, there are certain software facilities including natural resources, geographical location, economic infrastructure, and factories.  “We have innovative manpower as well as motivated and gifted young people with scientific capacities, and have technological capacities, and new thoughts,” he said. The Leader also underscored, “Another requirement for the implementation of this year’s slogan is stability in economic policies and decisions.”  “It is very detrimental for the country to make continuous changes in monetary policies and financial policies because it creates uncertainty, making entrepreneur hesitant.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
