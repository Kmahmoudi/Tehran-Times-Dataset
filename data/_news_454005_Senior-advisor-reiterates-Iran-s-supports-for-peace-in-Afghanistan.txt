TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a top foreign policy adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, has said Iran opposes the continuation of war in Afghanistan and reiterated Tehran’s long-held position for establishment of peace and stability in the war-torn country. “Any kind of war among Muslims is foul because Muslim blood is sacred,” Velayati said during a meeting with Afghan Ambassador Abdolghafour Lival, Mehr reported on Wednesday. He voiced Iran’s opposition to the presence of American forces in Afghanistan and warned of the threat posed by the Daesh (ISIS) terrorist group to the prospects of peace and security in the country. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh has expressed sympathy with the Afghans over a suicide bombing at an education center in western Kabul. “Afghanistan is once again wounded by blind terrorism,” Khatibzadeh tweeted on Saturday night. “Afghan students fell victim to ugly violence and an endless war they had never chosen.” Daesh claimed responsibility for the attack on social media.
