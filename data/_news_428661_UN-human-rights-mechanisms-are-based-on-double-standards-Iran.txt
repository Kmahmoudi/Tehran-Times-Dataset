TEHRAN – The UN mechanisms on human rights are politicized and based on double standards, Iran’s representative to the Third Committee of the UN said on Tuesday. 
 “Producing annually four nearly identical reports on the situation of human rights in Iran should solely be attributed to the adoption of a harmful selective approach based on double standards,” Mohammad Hosni Nejad remarked. Following is the full text of his speech posted on the IRNA website: The report A/73/299 yet again brings to light manipulation and politicization that exists in the UN human rights mechanisms. Producing annually four nearly identical reports on the situation of human rights in Iran should solely be attributed to the adoption of a harmful selective approach based on double standards. An approach that further erodes the integrity and credibility of the United Nations' human rights mechanisms. Beyond political considerations, there is no credible ground for the duplication of allegations against Iran four times a year. The report under question is the result of a counter-productive mandate, which makes it objectionable in its entirety, notwithstanding its attempt to reflect, though partially and with reluctance, the provided comments on the report by Iran.  2- The report’s adoption of a selective approach on the human rights of Iranians is disturbing. It is expected that reports of this nature be all-inclusive and address all of the human rights of the entire population without distinction. However, the report sounds as selective as the mandate itself. The re-imposition of illegal and illegitimate sanctions against Iran after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, which was unanimously adopted by the Security Council with the support of the U.S. itself, was barely touched upon by the authors of the report. The genocidal sanctions indiscriminately violate the basic economic and social rights of ordinary Iranians, and yet the report choose not to even mention it.  3- Specific cases have been raised in the report that have been separately and extensively responded to in detail. However, the gravity of such cases, which are regrettable in their own place, do not warrant a country-specific report. No country can claim to be perfect; neither does Iran. There is always room and the possibility to improve practices as well as laws to the extent that they do not contradict the social norms acceptable to citizens. 4- Mutual respect and dialogue serve as the right path to address any genuine concern regarding human rights. To enhance the credibility of human rights discourse, we seek respectful dialogue without recrimination or blame game and welcome meaningful engagement with all serious partners. President Rouhani’s policy of constructive engagement with the world promises new horizons for dialogue-based cooperation, understanding and mutual respect in all fields, including the human rights.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
