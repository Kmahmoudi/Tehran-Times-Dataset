TERHAN- An Iranian banking delegation visiting Croatia investigated removal of banking impediments between the two countries to ease mutual trade with their Croatian counterparts, the portal of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) reported on Wednesday. The Iranian delegation including representatives from Iranian banks of Sepah, Pasargad, and Bank of Industry and Mine visited Božo Prka, the CEO of Privredna Banka Zagreb (PBZ), where the Croatian banking official referred to the common banking ties between the two countries before the West-led sanctions were imposed on Iran, hoping that such relations would be resumed in post-sanction era.  Iranian bankers, for their parts, suggested establishment of banking relations in the first step to revive banking ties and assured the Croatian side that Iran sees no legal barrier on the way of boosting its banking bonds with Croatia, but the main obstacle is European banks' reliance on the American ones that avoids them from commencing ties with Iranian banks.  HJ/MA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
