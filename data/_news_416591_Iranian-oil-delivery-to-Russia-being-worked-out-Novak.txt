TEHRAN- Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that supply of Iranian oil to Russia under the oil-for-goods mechanism is being worked out. This issue is still under discussion, the minister told TASS. Earlier Novak said that a contract with Iran to supply 100,000 barrels of oil per day to Russia has already been concluded. The corresponding memorandum was signed by Russia and Iran in 2014. In February, Iran had announced that it will begin selling 100,000 barrels of oil a day to Russia within the following 15 days and receive payment half in cash and half in goods and services, according to ISNA.
