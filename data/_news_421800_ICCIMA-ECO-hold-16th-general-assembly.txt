TEHRAN- The 16th general assembly of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mine and Agriculture (ICCIMA) and Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) was held at the place of ICCIMA in Tehran on Monday, IRIB news reported.
 The meeting was attended by Iranian Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi, ICCIMA Head Gholam-Hossein Shafeie, chairmen of Iran’s Chambers of Commerce, and ambassadors of ECO countries in Iran. Addressing the assembly, Shafeie lamented that while the ECO members enjoy ample natural and minerals resources they do not have proper cooperation with each other; therefore, a new approach should be adopted by them and there should be a new way of implementing the agreements inside this organization.   MA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
