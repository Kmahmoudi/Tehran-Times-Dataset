TEHRAN- Iran’s major steel producers exported 4.4 million tons of crude steel during the first ten months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2016-January 19, 2017), registering a 45 percent rise compared to the same period in the previous year. The main producers’ output also witnessed a 2.42 percent rise year on year, IRIB reported on Sunday.  Iran’s annual crude steel production and exports are planned to hit 15 million tons and 6 million tons, respectively, by the end of the current Iranian calendar year. The country’s annual crude steel output is planned to reach 55 million tons according to its outlook plan for 2025. As a major steel producer in the region, Iran boosted its steel mills across the country in recent years, as central Isfahan and southwestern Khuzestan provinces remain the major steel producers. According to the latest report published by the World Steel Association, Iran produced 17.89 million tons of crude steel in 2016, registering an 11-percent growth compared to the figure in 2015.
