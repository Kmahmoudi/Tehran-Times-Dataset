TEHRAN- A board member of the Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture said that a joint chamber of commerce will be established between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Pointing out that the private sector has started the necessary planning for economic interaction with Saudi Arabia, Keyvan Kashefi said: "Soon, with the follow-up of the ICCIMA, a joint chamber of commerce between Iran and Saudi Arabia will be set up." He called the normalization of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia the main political and economic issue of the country in the last month and said the private sector welcomes this constructive and positive interaction. The ICCIMA board member further considered this political decision, the results of which were very positive on the country's economy, to be a useful mechanism and expressed hope that these positive interactions with different countries will continue. Pointing out that Iran and Saudi Arabia are two big and important countries in the region, Kashefi said political and economic cooperation between the two countries is the basis for stability in the region. “Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the region with which we do not have a joint chamber of commerce, the official said, adding, "With the follow-up of the Iran Chamber, a joint chamber of commerce between the two countries will soon be established, and it will be a useful step to advance the economic goals of Iran and Saudi Arabia." “Also, we plan to start the exchange of trade delegations immediately after the reopening of the embassies and the deployment of the ambassadors of the two countries”, he added. According to Kashfi, there are many fields, including oil, gas, petrochemicals, and knowledge-based, for cooperation between the two countries, and these capacities should be used. Tehran and Riyadh reached an agreement in early March to resume diplomatic relations after years of hostility. The talks were brokered by China. According to the National, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that his country is ready to support a follow-up process between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore diplomatic relations. Xi’s comments came in a phone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, state media CCTV reported. The crown prince told Xi of the importance of the strategic relations between the two countries and that he appreciated Chinese efforts to develop relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, said the kingdom’s official state media SPA. “During the call, they reviewed aspects of the partnership between the kingdom and China, and joint coordination efforts to enhance cooperation between the two countries in various fields,” SPA said. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has said like Saudi Arabia his country also intends to invite the Saudi king to visit Iran. Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz has sent an invitation letter to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi asking him to pay a visit to Riyadh. “We will also send a similar invitation to the King of Saudi Arabia,” Amir Abdollahian told Al Jazeera on March 27.
