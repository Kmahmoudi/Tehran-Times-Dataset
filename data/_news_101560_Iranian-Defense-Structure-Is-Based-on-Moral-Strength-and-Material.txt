On philosophy of Iranian defense structure, the Leader underscored the difference between the moral strength and the material force and said that the moral strength overcomes material force. The Leader said the Islamic Revolution will never retreat from lofty aspirations of the great Iranian nation. Inspecting an exhibit of air force hardware affiliated to the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), the Leader said that the Islamic Republic will defend the rights of the nation and their national and Islamic identity. The Supreme Leader said that the superpowers appreciate material force in absence of morality and embark on oppression against human being, ignorance of humanitarian values, humiliating the human being, and aggression on the territories of the others. "Such superpowers and the world arrogance practically follow the logic of jungle and will never achieve victory in reality," the Leader said citing the example of the U.S. military might. Ayatollah Khamenei said that the Islamic Republic of Iran is an example of the moral strength brought by the people who defend the values. The moral strength has passed the examination in the past 24 years in Iran, he said. "Any place where such strength (moral strength) came into existence, the material force could not bring them to their knees. Lebanon and Palestine are the examples," the Leader said. Elaborating on the futility of the U.S. superiority over Saddam Hussein regime in March-April 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Leader said that the U.S. faced with the Iraqi people's moral strength has reached the point of inability, so the military power doesn't work there and the people call for withdrawal of the occupation force. Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces appreciated the progress the IRGC air force made and called for going ahead with the process of moral strength in parallel with the material force. Prior to the Supreme Leader's remarks, IRGC Commander Major General Rahim Safavi said that the IRGC is equipped with long-range missile being used in the air and navy defense. He said that the IRGC rapid deployment forces are well-prepared to enter into combat with the systematic support of the Basij (volunteer forces). The Leader inspected the air force jet fighters, combat and cargo choppers as well as the unmanned airplanes for reconnaissance missions. The IRGC air force performed airborne tactical exercises and Sukoi fighters also carried out air show while the Leader was inspecting the air base. The IRGC air force also took delivery of Shahab-3 long-range missile from the defense ministry on the occasion of the Supreme Leader inspection. The Leader lauded the achievements of the IRGC air force as "surprising". Commander of IRGC Air Force Brigadier General Kazemi said that the commanders, technicians and personnel of the IRGC air force are working endlessly to bolster national defense system.
