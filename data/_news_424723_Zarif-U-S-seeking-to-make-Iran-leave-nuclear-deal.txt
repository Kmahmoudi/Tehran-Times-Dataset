TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday that it is the U.S. “strategic objective” to make Iran leave the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
 “However, it does not mean that we will not exit the JCPOA under any circumstances, but we are aware of the other side’s objective,” Zarif said during a meeting of Iran’s chamber of commerce. He noted that the Europeans along with Russia and China seek to find a way to preserve the JCPOA. Even closest allies of the U.S. seek to preserve the nuclear deal, he added. “This will be a difficult path, but it will bring us a better future,” the chief diplomat remarked. On May 8, President Donald Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the UN-endorsed nuclear agreement and reintroduced unilateral sanctions on Iran. Iran has warned if its interests are not guaranteed under the nuclear agreement it would resume its nuclear activities with a greater speed. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in May that the EU is “determined to preserve” the nuclear deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping also issued a joint statement on June 8, supporting the JCPOA. ‘Enemy seeks to annihilate Iran’ Zarif also said that the enemy seeks to “annihilate” Iran. “The enemy’s target is neither the Islamic Republic system nor government of Rouhani, but it is Iran. It is Iran which can impede certain objectives. They seek to annihilate Iran,” the foreign minister opined. “We are talking about an Iran which is backed by the world while Trump stands alone.” Zairf said considering the current situation guarding national unity is of paramount importance. “Currently, domestic integrity is more important than anything else in the country. Currently, domestic integrity is more important than bread and air for us.” Zarif tacitly implied that the Trump administration and its client states in the region are seeking a disintegration of Iran. “Now, Iran, this great geography and honorable entity, has been targeted and hopefully we will foil the plots,” he noted. “During the sanctions time,… some foreign companies refrained from working with Iran and they cited bad reputation as the reason…. But today things have changed and Mr. Trump will pay for his bad reputation,” Zarif stated. “I believe that although the Americans’ hustle and bustle may be effective in short term, but in long term, Trump’s infamy will benefit us.” “I believe that although the Americans’ hustle and bustle may be effective in short term, but in long term, Trump’s infamy will benefit us.” He added, “I confirm our friends saying that America has spotted our breathing venues and is trying to block them.” Elsewhere, Zarif noted that Iranians are used to hardships. “We are entering tough spheres but we are used to such hardships…. We handled the war with oil at $8 per barrel. Now oil stands at $75 per barrel and Europeans say they guarantee our oil’s purchase.” Zarif was referring to Saddam Hussein’s war against Iran in the 1980s. ‘Reuters producing 50 fake news a day about Iran’s economy’ The foreign minister then attacked Reuters for its anti-Iranian stance. “These days Reuters news agency is producing about 50 fake news a day about Iran’s economy. A certain group is being financially backed by a neighboring country and is tasked with publishing such news implying that the whole world is withdrawing from Iran.” Zarif also commented on Trump’s foreign policy, saying his behavior is disrupting the international order. “He is destroying the order which is the result of 70 years of investment. No sane man in the West would want this order to be disrupted.” On Trump’s Iran policy, Zarif said, “We are talking about an Iran which is backed by the world while Trump stands alone.” NA/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
