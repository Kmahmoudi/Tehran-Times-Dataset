TEHRAN – Behrouz Nemati, spokesman for the parliament's presiding board, said on Sunday that during a meeting of the parliament it was decided that the Telegram messaging app will be unblocked under certain conditions. Nemati said Telegram’s CEO must accept Iran’s conditions. He added that the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology is tasked with following up on the issue, IRNA reported. He also said because of the country’s situation and measures recently taken by a spiteful website against the Islamic establishment and the fact that it exploited Telegram, the messaging app needs to meet such commitments.
