TEHRAN – A vast collection of objects handcrafted by Qajar-era (1785-1925) talented Iranian court artists will go on display from March 28 to July 22 at France’s Louvre-Lens art museum. Titled “The Rose Empire Masterpieces of 19th-Century Persian Art”, the exhibit will showcase over 400 works such as enamels, rugs, ceremonial weapons, clothing, personal ornamentation as well as paintings, drawings, and photographs, amongst others, according to claudinecolin.com. The selectees will be loaned from private collections and major European, North American and Middle Eastern institutions. According to the organizers, the art created during this period is widely deemed as original and rich driven partly by exceptionally-talented court artists. The Qajar-era is one of the most fascinating periods in the history of the country, embracing European modernization while maintaining its identity.
