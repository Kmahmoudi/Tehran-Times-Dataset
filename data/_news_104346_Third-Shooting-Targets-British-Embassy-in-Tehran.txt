Greenstock told the Mehr News Agency that shots were fired at the main gate of the residential compound of the British Embassy in the north of Tehran yesterday evening. The spokesman stressed that according to witnesses, two shots were fired around 6:10 p.m. at the Embassy buildings by unknown sources. "No one was hurt in the shooting and the perpetrators remain unknown," he said. "We raised talks with the Iranian Foreign Ministry officials after the shooting and demanded for an appropriate explanation for the three recent shootings which have all occurred in less than a month." Further in his remarks, Greenstock said that the first fire was shot at noon, September 3 at the Embassy's building in the center of town, the second on September 9 and the third yesterday evening at the residential compound of the Embassy. Police and the Foreign Ministry had already denied news of the second shooting at the British Embassy, stressing that the Embassy seeks to magnify the issue while it was only a matter of police forces tracking down a car somewhere around the Embassy.
