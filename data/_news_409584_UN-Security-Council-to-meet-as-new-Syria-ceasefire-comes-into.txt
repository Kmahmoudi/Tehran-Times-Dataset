Members of the UN Security Council are to convene for a closed meeting initiated by Russia to discuss the ceasefire brokered for Syria by Turkey and Russia that took effect at 12:00am on Friday, a diplomatic UN source said. “Russia requested this meeting. It is expected to focus on the ceasefire announced in Syria,” a diplomatic source at the UN headquarters told TASS news agency. Another source told the agency that Russia may propose a resolution endorsing the ceasefire. The meeting will be held later on Friday immediately after an open session that will review a draft resolution on prolonging the UN’s Oil-for-Food Program (OIP), which was established in 1995 to help Iraq exchange oil for food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies. Earlier on Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Russia would present a deal to the UN that was struck between the Syrian government and seven major rebel groups, including hardline Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam. According to a list released by the Russian Defense Ministry, other militant groups that have pledged to comply with its provisions include Faylaq Al-Sham, Thuwar al-Sham, Jaysh al-Muwahhideen, Jaysh Idlib, and Jabhat al-Shamiyah,. “We will inform UNSC members of the work we have done and answer their questions,” Lavrov said. If any of the groups fails to abide by the conditions stipulated in the deal, it will become a legitimate target for attack.
