Air pollution, poor water quality, insufficient water availability, unsatisfactory public transportation and high energy consumption are among the issues discussed in the series by a number of Iranian and foreign experts. Martin Seger from Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt in Austria and ECO Cultural Institute (ECI) former president Iftikhar Husain Arif are among the scholars spoke in the documentary, which has been produced at the Islamic Revolution Documentary Center. The unbalance and unequal growth of the city leading to Tehran’s deteriorating condition has also been reviewed in “Capital”, scenes of which were screened at the meeting. “The life of Tehran is in danger and the trees that could have helped preserve the health of the city are gone,” environmentalist Mohammad Darvish warns in the documentary. “Over 170 species of birds used to live in the city and could help fertilize the soil are disappearing day by day. The birds could decrease the stress and improve the social health of the citizens,” he added. The series is due to be aired on the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) in the near future.
