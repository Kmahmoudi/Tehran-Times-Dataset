TEHRAN – The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has once again confirmed that Iran is fulfilling its commitments under the nuclear deal, aka the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

 In an annual review on “IAEA Highlights and Achievements in 2017 – A Year in Review” published on Friday on the IAEA website, the UN nuclear watchdog said that it continued to verify and monitor the implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments under the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers. “In his quarterly reports to the IAEA Board of Governors, Mr. Amano [the director general of the IAEA] confirmed that the nuclear commitments undertaken by Iran were being implemented. IAEA inspectors have continued to inspect facilities in Iran, have taken hundreds of environmental samples, and carried out activities supported by state-of-the-art technology, including data collecting and processing systems,” the annual review reads. Under the nuclear agreement, endorsed by the United National Security Council, Iran is obliged to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions.
