He expressed hope that all countries take lessons from the favorable coexistence of religious and ethnic minorities in Iran and Croatia. For his part, Hasanovic said the purpose behind the visit of his entourage to Iran is to help launch dialogue between different religions. Without dialogue there would be conflicts between religious groups therefore it is necessary to promote dialogue between them and there is “no alternative” to this, the Croatian mufti remarked. “We are in Iran to announce to the world commitment to this principle (religious dialogue),” Hasanovic noted. He added, “The idea of dialogue between religions is very important and we should try to generalize this dialogue and promote it to higher level.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
