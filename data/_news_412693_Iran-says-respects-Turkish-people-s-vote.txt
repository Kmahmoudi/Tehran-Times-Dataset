TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday that Tehran respects the Turkish people’s vote in the recent referendum in the country.
 “The issue of referendum in Turkey is an internal affair of the neighboring country. What has happened and will happen will be related to the Turkish government and people and we respect the Turkish people’s vote,” he said during a press conference.  Commenting on the effects of referendum on the Middle East region, he said, “We should wait and see.” “However, I hope that it [referendum] would help peace, stability and security in Turkey,” the spokesman added. Turkey held a referendum on a package of constitutional changes on Sunday as the result of which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared victory. According to Hurriyet Daily News, 51.3 percent of the more than 58 million Turkish voters said “yes” to the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) constitutional amendment package in a tight race to decide on whether to shift to an executive presidential system. “God willing, these results will be the beginning of a new era in our country,” CNN quoted Erdogan as saying after his victory on Sunday night.
