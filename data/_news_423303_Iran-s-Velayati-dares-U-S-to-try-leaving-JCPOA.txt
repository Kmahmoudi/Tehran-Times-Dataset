TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, said on Sunday that Iran will make the U.S. “remorseful” if it ditches the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 “If the U.S. pulls out of the JCPOA, Iran will definitely counter appropriately and make it [the U.S.] regret,” he pointed out. Velayati added that Iran has various options to respond if the U.S. quits the nuclear deal. “The U.S. can give it a try. If it wants to pull out of the JCPOA or play a political game to prevent Iran from enjoying its rightful benefits, the Islamic Republic of Iran will definitely make it remorseful,” the veteran politician remarked. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to decide next week whether to stay in the deal or not. The nuclear parties including the European Union, Germany, Britain, Russia, and China have reiterated their support for the international nuclear agreement which was signed in July 2015 and took effect in January 2016.
