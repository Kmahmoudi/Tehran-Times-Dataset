TEHRAN - Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Tuesday that Iran’s action in launching satellite is not against international law.
 Iran attempted on Tuesday to launch Payam satellite into orbit but the rocket’s third stage failed to provide enough speed to reach the orbit. “All the experts know that satellite carriers and non-nuclear surface-to-surface ballistic missiles are different structurally from missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads,” he told reporters, according to IRNA. He noted that there is no reason for criticizing Iran’s missile program. “Iran is never doing an action contradicting international regulations when it tests its missiles”, he said. He noted that Resolution 2231 of the UN Security Council has not considered any ban on using ballistic missiles’ technologies for Iran and it has only demanded it to avoid launching missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads. “Therefore, criticizing Iran for its missile program is wrong and we know it irresponsible move, as it leads the global community to astray purposefully and knowingly,” he said. Iran has repeatedly said its missile program is purely defensive and its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads.
