Individual and organizational entrepreneurship threats and opportunities in Iran, develop and boost entrepreneurship in Iranian market and financing would be some of the main themes of the conference. An entrepreneurial ecosystem or entrepreneurship ecosystem refers to the social and economic environment affecting the local/regional entrepreneurship. It can also be a group of companies, including start-ups, and one or more coordination entities, which share similar goals and decide to form a network or organization in order to explore economies of scale combined with flexibility and entrepreneurial "drive".  Some researchers believe governments have little effect to create an ecosystem for entrepreneurship. Nonetheless, the entrepreneurial ecosystem idea does lend itself to entrepreneurship policy, where targeted programs can be developed to plug the gaps in the ecosystem.  SB/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
