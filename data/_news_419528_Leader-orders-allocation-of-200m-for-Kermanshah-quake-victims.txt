TEHRAN – Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei approved withdrawal of $200 million from the National Development Fund to assist Kermanshah quake victims, Majlis speaker Ali Larijani said on Tuesday.
 Following the Supreme Leader’s decree, members of the Majlis hammered out and approved an amendment to the current year’s budget law. The fund is earmarked to provide 500-million-rial (nearly $12,500) loans and decrease the cost of electricity, water and gas, etc. in the region, Khabaronline reported. The severe magnitude 7.3 quake which struck the western province of Kermanshah on November 12 caused considerable damages to the infrastructure and buildings and claimed 579 lives. The slow process of providing temporary shelters coupled with cold weather is the main problem of earthquake-stricken victims.  MAH/MQ/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
