She said that the remaining members of the JCPOA– Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia – would also maintain their commitments to support Iran on civilian nuclear energy. ‘We will remain in a deal which is beneficial to us’ In a separate meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, Rouhani said that Iran will remain in the nuclear accord as long as it benefits the country. “Iran is totally committed to its obligations, however, any deal is two-sided and we will remain in an agreement which meet our benefits,” he stated.
