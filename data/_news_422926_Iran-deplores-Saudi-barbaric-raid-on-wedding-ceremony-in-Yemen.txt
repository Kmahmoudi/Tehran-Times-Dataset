TEHRAN – Iran has strongly denounced Saudi Arabia’s “barbaric” airstrike that killed scores of civilians at a wedding ceremony in a Yemeni village, Tasnim reported.
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday that the attack, which was conducted in Yemen’s northwestern province of Hajjah on Sunday, was a sign of “frustration and failure of the aggressors”. Bombing Yemen’s residential areas, targeting civilians, and blocking delivery of humanitarian assistance amount to the violation of humanitarian law, he said. The spokesman also called on the UN to accelerate efforts to end the aggression on Yemen and protect civilian lives.
