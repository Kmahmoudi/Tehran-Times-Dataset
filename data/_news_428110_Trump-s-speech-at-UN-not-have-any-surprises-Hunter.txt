Globalization refers to the free movement of capital, free trade, irrespective of its impact on national economies, a lax approach to immigration and cultural and political internationalism. Many both in America and Europe believe that globalization has negatively affected the lives of the more vulnerable sectors of their societies while enriching others. In America globalization has led to the flight of manufacturing industries to Mexico and other third world countries leading to severe unemployment problems in some states in the U.S. Trump wants to change this situation. Limits on Chinese imports is part of this strategy. Trump also believes that lax immigration policies has been altering America's cultural landscape.
