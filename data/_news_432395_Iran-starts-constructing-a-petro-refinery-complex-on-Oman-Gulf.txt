TEHRAN – Iran’s National Petrochemical Company (NPC) kicked off the construction of a petro-refinery complex in Jask Island on the shores of the Gulf of Oman in southern Iran, IRNA reported on Sunday quoting an official with NPC. According to NPC Project Director Alimohammad Bosaqzadeh, the complex is aimed to supply part of the country’s energy needs and also to increase non-oil exports from the region. “Considering the ample crude oil feedstock at place, the complex will be able to produce gasoline, gas oil, fuel oil, sulfur, and other byproducts like butadiene, polyethylene and propylene polymer products, as well as mono-ethylene glycol and several other petrochemical products”, he explained. The official further noted that the complex will be constructed in collaboration with renowned companies and the construction of this important complex will lead to the transformation of this important and strategic region. Being closer to South Asian countries has made this strategic region significant for Iran’s future export plans.
