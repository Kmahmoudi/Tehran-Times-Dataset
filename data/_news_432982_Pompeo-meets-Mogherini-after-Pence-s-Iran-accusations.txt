U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in Brussels on Friday, a day after Vice President Mike Pence accused America’s traditional European allies of trying to undermine U.S. sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported. Pompeo’s meeting with Mogherini was scheduled before Pence’s rebuke of European powers, during a Middle East conference in Warsaw on Thursday. Mogherini missed the conference, citing a scheduling conflict at NATO. Mogherini, who helped seal the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, greeted Pompeo at EU headquarters in Brussels.  MH/ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
