TEHRAN – The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that the range of Iran’s missiles is up to 2000 kilometers which is enough to respond to possible aggressions against the country.
 “Iran limits range of its missiles up to 2000 kilometers based on policies set by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution. Iran is capable of increasing missiles’ range, however, the current range suffices for us because U.S. forces are within this 2000 kilometers and we can respond to them,” Jafari told reporters on the sidelines of a conference titled “A World Without Terror”. He also said that the U.S. is seeking to exert economic pressure on Iran, because it is fearful of consequences of a war with Iran. “The U.S. has been exerting pressure and hatching plots against us over the years, however, our people and system have been resisting and are following their path strongly,” the top commander remarked. During his speech at the conference, Jafari said that the U.S. should be aware of the fact that more economic pressure and sanctions against Iran will make the Iranians more determined to increase national defense power.
