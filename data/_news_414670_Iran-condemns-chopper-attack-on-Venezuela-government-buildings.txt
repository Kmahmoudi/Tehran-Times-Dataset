TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday condemned a helicopter attack on Venezuela's Supreme Court and Interior Ministry buildings.

 Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi described peaceful dialogue between the government and the opposition without foreign interference as the best way for settling disputes, according to the ministry’s website. He added “illegal and violent” moves against the Latin American nation’s administrative and legitimate organizations would only complicate the situation. He warned that armed attacks will obstruct settlement of the tension. SP/PA
