TEHRAN – Directors of the National Museum of Iran and the Shanghai Museum are set to widen ties in various spheres, as cultural interactions between the two countries are deeply rooted in time.  National Museum of Iran Director Jebreil Nokandeh and Shanghai Museum Director Yang Zhigang signed a memorandum of understanding in Tehran on March 12. The officials also exchanged views on the formation of a joint exhibit, which will revolve around Silk Road as the main theme. “The continuation of such cultural relations would have resulted in more closeness and mutual understanding between the two ancient cultures,” ISNA quoted Nokandeh as saying on Monday. For his part, Zhigang called cooperation between the two institutions a factor for reinforcing bilateral relations. Exchanging expertise and know-how as well as organizing master classes, workshops, training courses and joint exhibits are among arenas that the MOU touches upon.
