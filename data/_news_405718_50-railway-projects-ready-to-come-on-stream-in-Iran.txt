TEHRAN- On the occasion of the Government Week  (August 23-29), Iran has 50 railway projects ready for inauguration, Saeid Mohammadzadeh, the deputy head of Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRIR) for technical and infrastructure affairs, announced. The official explained that these projects include removing accident-prone spots, building railways, constructing unlevel crossings, as well as buildings and installations, IRNA reported on Wednesday.
Some projects are also ready for inauguration in the passenger sector, Mohammadzadeh added.
Previously, in mid June, the official had said that the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRIR) gives any support to the domestic manufacturers for the manufacturing of railways’ required parts, components and equipments in a bid to make the country sovereign in development of its railway transportation.
“The country’s policies of Resistance Economy require us to move toward development of railway transportation as the fuel consumption for transporting one ton of cargo via railway is one fifth that of the road,” the official asserted.
Transportation through railway rose 100 percent in Iran over the past Iranian calendar year 1394 (ended on March 19) from its previous year and also in 1393 from its preceding year, according to head of IRIR Mohsen Pour Seyed Aqaei.
