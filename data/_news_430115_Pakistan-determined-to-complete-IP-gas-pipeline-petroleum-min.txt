TEHRAN- Pakistani Petroleum Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan announced on Friday that his country is resolved to complete Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, IRNA reported. "Pakistan will implement the project," the Pakistani minister vowed. I have received an invitation letter from Iranian oil minister but the trip’s itinerary has not been planned yet, he told IRNA. Regarding the imposed U.S. sanctions on Iran, Sarwar Khan said that Pakistan’s decisions would merely base on the country’s interests. He also informed that an Iranian expert delegation has visited Islamabad to resume negotiations on IP project. Near 20 years after the initiation of talks over the peace gas pipeline, beginning as the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project, and despite the fact that Iran has completed its part of the pipeline in its territory, Pakistan has fallen behind the target to take delivery of gas, initially scheduled for 2014. The IP pipeline, would cover a distance of 1,900 kilometers, initially it would bring 750 million cubic feet of gas per day, which could later be enhanced to one billion cubic feet per day.
