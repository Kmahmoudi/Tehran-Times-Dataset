TEHRAN - Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Monday that the ill-wishers of the Iranian people are seeking to depict an uncertain future.
 “We should take counteractions if the enemy seeks to endanger the people’s trust,” he said during a conference at the Iran University of Science and Technology. The vice president said the country is going through a difficult time, however, there are opportunities even in the difficulties. He attached great importance to role of the universities in helping find solutions to problems. He said that “scientific advancement guarantee the country’s survival”. “University can be focal point of boosting the national integrity,” he noted. Elsewhere, he noted that “sustainable development” originates from inside the country. “Domestic capacities are the main and focal points of the resistance economy,” he added. Pointing to the U.S. psychological warfare against Iran, Jahangiri said, “The U.S. thinks it can put pressure against our economy and public opinion by its economic and media power.” U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran.  The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on August 6. The second batch will be restored on November 4. Back in May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Washington will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic.
