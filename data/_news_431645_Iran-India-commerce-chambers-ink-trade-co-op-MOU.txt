Iranian bank to open Mumbai branch On Tuesday, Mohammad Javad Zarif also met with the Indian Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources Nitin Gadkari during which the two sides discussed various issues including banking problems and Chabahar port. After the meeting, Gadkar told the Indian press that the government has allowed Iran’s Bank Pasargad to open its Mumbai branch within the next three months. “They [Iran’s Pasargad Bank] are going to open a branch in Mumbai in three months. That will be used for transactions.” The official said. "We have had a good discussion with the minister (Zarif). The first ship from Brazil has already been received at Chabahar. The financial arrangement is ready. There were some problems, but we have resolved the issues," Gadkar added. ‘Iran won’t wait for Europe to facilitate trade’ On the sidelines of his meeting with Gadkar, Zarif said the European Union was moving slower than expected in facilitating non-dollar trade with Tehran to circumvent U.S. sanctions, forcing it to explore avenues with other nations. “We continue to work with the Europeans for the special purpose vehicle but we are not waiting for them,” Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in New Delhi. “We are working with our traditional partners like India, like China, like Russia so that we continue to work in the interest of our people.” Zarif also said he was talking to Indian officials about selling more urea to India at a “reasonable” rate.
