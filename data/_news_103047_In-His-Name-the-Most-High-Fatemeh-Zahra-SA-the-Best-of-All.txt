Today (20th Jamadi al-Thani 1424 A.H., August 19, 2003) marks the birth anniversary of the Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA). Her father was the Holy Prophet Mohammad (S) and her mother was Khadijeh (SA). May Allah hasten the glorious reappearance of her great great great great great great great great great grandson, Imam Mahdi (AS). Miraculous Birth One of the most important event occurred in the Prophet’s (S) life was his Ascension (Me’raj). In that year, which was the fifth year of his mission by the command of Almighty God, he was taken on his Ascension to observe the kingdom of the heaven. And he was shown the magnificent signs of God in the area of the exalted heavens, so his great soul became greater and well-prepared for acceptance of a great mission with greater hope. According to authentic Sunni and Shia reports, “The Prophet on the night of his ascension was passing through paradise, Gabriel gave his lordship some of the fruit of tooba (the name of a tree that exists in paradise), and then the Holy Prophet (S) returned to earth, and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) was conceived. It is a very popular tradition narrated from both the Sunni and the Shia: One day the Holy Prophet’s (S) wife Aisha said, “Why do you kiss your daughter so much!?" The Prophet said in reply: “Whenever I kiss Fatemeh (SA), I smell the scent of the Highest Heaven on her.” It was thus that this great child from a father such as the Holy Prophet (S) and mother such as Khadijeh (SA), the first woman to believe in Islam, the loyal wife of the Holy Prophet (S), on the 20th day of Jamadi al-Thani in the eighth year before the hijra (615 C.E.) came into the world. And the taunts and reproaches of the Prophet’s opponents, that he was as they thought without a succeeding generation, were all made in vain. No one can forget the condition of Khadijeh (SA) at that historic and divine moment. As narrators report, “As the difficult, critical moments of giving birth began, she was alone in her home, and not a woman who could aid her was there. Her heart grew heavier, and the roaring waves of the people’s unkindness tormented her pure soul. Suddenly there shone a flash on the horizon of her soul, she opened her eyes and saw four women near her, and she became greatly worried. One of the four women called, “Be not afraid, nor sad. Your kind God has sent us to your aid, we are your sisters.” “I am Sarah! And this is Asiyah, the wife of Pharaoh who will be one of your friends in heaven. The other is Maryam (SA, the daughter of Imran. And this fourth that you see is the sister of Musa son of Imran Kulthum! We have come so that at this hour we may be of aid to you.” And they remained with her until Fatemeh (SA), the lady of Islam, opened her eyes to the world. (Tabray in Zakharato-al Ughba). That is why the Holy Prophet (S) points out in following verse: “(As for) those who say, our Lord is Allah, then continue in the right way, the angels descend upon them, saying, Fear not, nor be grieved, Not only Angels, but women of high worldly status rushed to the aid of the first believing woman of Islam, Khadijeh (SA).” The birth of this auspicious child so pleased the Prophet (S) that he began speaking in praise and eulogy of Allah, and the tongues of the ill-wishers who called him “Abtar” (which means man without offspring) were forever silenced. Almighty Allah gave glad tidings of this blessed child to the Prophet (S) in the Holy Qoran in a chapter named Kauthar (heavenly fountain of unbounded grace and benefits): “In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, (1) Surely we have given you Kauthar, (2) So pray unto your Lord and make a sacrifice, (3) Surely your enemy is the one who shall be without posterity." Name and Titles of the Heavenly Lady This heavenly lady had many names and titles, each being more meaningful than the other. The following are the most popular: 1) Fatemeh: its root is Fatm, meaning being separated or taken off from milk. The Holy Prophet (S), in a very authentic tradition accepted by both Sunni and Shia, asked Ali (AS), the commander of the faithful: "Do you know why my daughter was named Fatemeh?" Ali (AS) replied: “Please say so.” The Holy Prophet (S) said, “Because she and the Shia, the followers of her way, are separated from the fires of hell." 2) Zahra means shining. When Imam Sadeq (AS) was asked why they call Fatemeh Zahra, he replied: “Because Zahra means shining and Fatemeh was such that when she stood in mehrab of prayer, her light was a radiance for the inhabitants of the skies (heavens) just as the light of the stars is for the inhabitants of the earth.  Therefore she was given the name Zahra." 3) Seddiqeh (most truthful lady) 4) Tahereh (pure lady) 5) Mobarakeh (blessed lady) 6) Zakieh (purified lady) 7) Razieh (lady Allah is satisfied with) 8) Marzieh (Allah is satisfied with her) 9) Mohaddatheh (narrator of the traditions) Prophet’s Love of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) The Holy Prophet (S) many times said: "Fatemeh is a part of me and the light of my eyes, the fruit of my heart, and my soul …. And she is a Huri [woman of paradise] with human qualities.” All of the historians and masters of the traditions (hadith) have written that the Prophet (S) had an astonishing attachment to his daughter Fatemeh Zahra (SA). No doubt the Prophet’s affection was not only because of their relationship as father and child, even though this sentiment swelled the Prophet’s being, the phrases and words the Prophet (S) spoke when he expressed his affection for his daughter Fatemeh Zahra (SA) showed that there was something else. The affection was unique. The Love of the beloved of God is the love of God. Following are some traditions quoted from authentic Shia and Sunni sources: 1) Whenever the desire for heaven appears in my heart I (the Holy Prophet [S] kiss Fatemeh. 2) Maryam (Mary) (SA) was the greatest woman of her time, but my daughter Fatemeh is the greatest woman of the whole world, from the first to the last. 3) The first person to come to me in heaven will be Fatemeh. 4) Aisha reported, ”There was no man near to Prophet (S) who was more love than Ali (AS) and not of the women more loved than Fatemeh.” 5) Referring to one of the verses of the Qoran, Fatemeh (SA) said: “After this verse was revealed I did not dare to call my father dear and when I went to him I would say, O, Messenger of God.” One or two times after I repeated this address, I saw that the Prophet (S) became upset and turned his face away from me, the third time he turned to me and said, “O, Fatemeh, this verse was not revealed for you, and not for your family and descendants, you are of me and I am of you. This was revealed in relation to the oppressors and ill-mannered of the Quraish.” 6) The Holy Prophet (S) said, “Whoever harms her, surely has harmed me, and whoever angers her, surely has made me angry; whoever makes her glad, has surely made me glad, and whoever saddens her, surely has made me sad.” Heavenly Lady's Personality Fatemeh Zahra (SA) is the only shining jewel of the creation, a luminous star, a bright star in the heavens of sainthood, the intermediary for earthly and heavenly creation, the wise one, the daughter and a part of the flesh of Holy Prophet (S), the worthy wife of the commander of the faithful, Imam Ali (AS), unparalleled heroine throughout the history of Islam. Lady Fatemeh (SA) always appearing as the manifestation of self-sacrifice, bravery, affection, abundant generosity in the way of the presentation of Islam and the Qoran and support of the Imamate. Her value and personality is so high that in many places the Holy Qoran talks about her, such as the following: 1) The revelation of verse 33 of chapter 33 of the Holy Qoran When the Holy Prophet (S) gathered all four people, Ali (AS), Hassan (AS), Hussein (AS), and Fatemeh (SA), under a woolen cloak, Gabriel revealed: “Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House, and to purify you a (thorough) purifying." Every one would be aware as to who was considered the Holy Prophet’s (S) Household. It was only after this event that these five, the Prophet, Fatemeh (AS), her husband Ali (AS) and her two children Hassan and Hussein (AS) were known as “Companions of Cloak”. 2) Event of Mubahela (Mutual Invocation of a Curse) Where, as per the Divine command, the Holy Prophet (S), called the Christians of Najran for “Mubahela,” then this verse was revealed. “Truth is from your Lord. So do not allow doubt to enter yourself. Then to the one who quarrels and disputes with you after having knowledge and awareness (about Jesus Christ), say: “Let us call our children and your children, our women and your women, our beloved ones and your beloved ones and then engage in mutual invocation of cursing (Mubahela) until the curse of God descends upon the group telling the lie,” (Holy Qoran). In complying with this divine command, the Holy Prophet (S) appeared on the scene of Mubahela along with Hassanain (AS), the two children of lady Fatemeh (SA), and Ali (AS). 3) Revelation of 76th chapter of Holy Qoran, to show us the strength of sacrifice. When the news of the sickness of the Hassanian, the two sons of lady Fatemeh (AS), reached Holy Prophet (S), his heart began to beat and became impatient, he rushed to visit them. Two other people accompanied him. The Holy Prophet (S) patted his two sons with his kind hands and prayed for their recovery from the depth of his heart. One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) gave a suggestion to Ali (AS) to make a vow (Nazr) for their recovery that whenever they regain their health he would fulfill his vow. His wife lady Fatemeh (SA), the children and Fizzah, the loyal maid of the house, also made the same decision that when the children recovered from the illness they would keep fast for three days. In those times the Muslims were living in severe poverty and were destitute. Most of the close companions of the Holy Prophet (S) did not even have food to eat every day. The Holy Prophet (S) and most Muslims were experiencing lives of hardship. Like the other people, Ali (AS), too, had nothing at all. When the two children recovered from their illness, all of them fasted on the next day. Any how, after Ali (AS) brought a measure of barley, Fatemeh Zahra (AS) baked five loaves of bread, for each of them one loaf. At the time of breaking the fast (sunset), when all sat around the table cloth, Ali (AS) took the first morsel of bread to eat when suddenly a sorrowful cry of a poor man who was standing outside the door was heard. “Peace and salutations be upon you (all), O household of Mohammad (S),the messenger of God, I am a helpless, needy Muslim; give me also from whatever you eat, so that God may give you in exchange a table of food from paradise.” On hearing the cry of that disappointed poor man, Ali (AS) and the other four members of the holy house decided to help him and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) picked up all that was on the table cloth and gave it to that poor man. That night, they broke their fast with water and went to sleep hungry. The next day they once again fasted and then again at the time of breaking the fast an orphan knocked on the door and asked for help. That night too, they broke their fast with water and all went to sleep more hungry than the previous night. The next day, they again fasted. The third day, there was no longer strength. It was two days that they had not eaten food. Hunger was severely tormenting them. They sat beside the table cloth, but as Ali (AS) picked up the first morsel of bread, a captive greeted them loudly and asked for food and for the third time, this holy family donated their meals (only bread) to the needy man. When the Holy Prophet (S) realized that they had eaten nothing for three days, he said, "I take refuge in Allah. It is three days that you all are in such a state, and I am unaware of your condition." Yes, the Holy Prophet (S) was not aware what his most beloved ones had to suffer in this period of time; however the God of the Prophet (S) knew what had happened and knew the splendor and magnificence of the sacrifice of these chosen ones of creation. For this reason Gabriel descended and addressed the Holy Prophet (S), saying, “O, Mohammad, take away what God has prepared for your household members.” The Messenger of God asked, "What should I take?" Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib. You also marry her to Ali on earth.'” The extraordinary virtue of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) one side and on the other side, her blood relations with the Prophet (S) and still on another side, the nobility of her family, caused many of the high-ranking supporters of the Prophet (S) to propose to her, but all received negative answers. The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).

The Prophet said in reply: “Whenever I kiss Fatemeh (SA), I smell the scent of the Highest Heaven on her.” It was thus that this great child from a father such as the Holy Prophet (S) and mother such as Khadijeh (SA), the first woman to believe in Islam, the loyal wife of the Holy Prophet (S), on the 20th day of Jamadi al-Thani in the eighth year before the hijra (615 C.E.) came into the world. And the taunts and reproaches of the Prophet’s opponents, that he was as they thought without a succeeding generation, were all made in vain. No one can forget the condition of Khadijeh (SA) at that historic and divine moment. As narrators report, “As the difficult, critical moments of giving birth began, she was alone in her home, and not a woman who could aid her was there. Her heart grew heavier, and the roaring waves of the people’s unkindness tormented her pure soul. Suddenly there shone a flash on the horizon of her soul, she opened her eyes and saw four women near her, and she became greatly worried. One of the four women called, “Be not afraid, nor sad. Your kind God has sent us to your aid, we are your sisters.” “I am Sarah! And this is Asiyah, the wife of Pharaoh who will be one of your friends in heaven. The other is Maryam (SA, the daughter of Imran. And this fourth that you see is the sister of Musa son of Imran Kulthum! We have come so that at this hour we may be of aid to you.” And they remained with her until Fatemeh (SA), the lady of Islam, opened her eyes to the world. (Tabray in Zakharato-al Ughba). That is why the Holy Prophet (S) points out in following verse: “(As for) those who say, our Lord is Allah, then continue in the right way, the angels descend upon them, saying, Fear not, nor be grieved, Not only Angels, but women of high worldly status rushed to the aid of the first believing woman of Islam, Khadijeh (SA).” The birth of this auspicious child so pleased the Prophet (S) that he began speaking in praise and eulogy of Allah, and the tongues of the ill-wishers who called him “Abtar” (which means man without offspring) were forever silenced. Almighty Allah gave glad tidings of this blessed child to the Prophet (S) in the Holy Qoran in a chapter named Kauthar (heavenly fountain of unbounded grace and benefits): “In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, (1) Surely we have given you Kauthar, (2) So pray unto your Lord and make a sacrifice, (3) Surely your enemy is the one who shall be without posterity." Name and Titles of the Heavenly Lady This heavenly lady had many names and titles, each being more meaningful than the other. The following are the most popular: 1) Fatemeh: its root is Fatm, meaning being separated or taken off from milk. The Holy Prophet (S), in a very authentic tradition accepted by both Sunni and Shia, asked Ali (AS), the commander of the faithful: "Do you know why my daughter was named Fatemeh?" Ali (AS) replied: “Please say so.” The Holy Prophet (S) said, “Because she and the Shia, the followers of her way, are separated from the fires of hell." 2) Zahra means shining. When Imam Sadeq (AS) was asked why they call Fatemeh Zahra, he replied: “Because Zahra means shining and Fatemeh was such that when she stood in mehrab of prayer, her light was a radiance for the inhabitants of the skies (heavens) just as the light of the stars is for the inhabitants of the earth.  Therefore she was given the name Zahra." 3) Seddiqeh (most truthful lady) 4) Tahereh (pure lady) 5) Mobarakeh (blessed lady) 6) Zakieh (purified lady) 7) Razieh (lady Allah is satisfied with) 8) Marzieh (Allah is satisfied with her) 9) Mohaddatheh (narrator of the traditions) Prophet’s Love of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) The Holy Prophet (S) many times said: "Fatemeh is a part of me and the light of my eyes, the fruit of my heart, and my soul …. And she is a Huri [woman of paradise] with human qualities.” All of the historians and masters of the traditions (hadith) have written that the Prophet (S) had an astonishing attachment to his daughter Fatemeh Zahra (SA). No doubt the Prophet’s affection was not only because of their relationship as father and child, even though this sentiment swelled the Prophet’s being, the phrases and words the Prophet (S) spoke when he expressed his affection for his daughter Fatemeh Zahra (SA) showed that there was something else. The affection was unique. The Love of the beloved of God is the love of God. Following are some traditions quoted from authentic Shia and Sunni sources: 1) Whenever the desire for heaven appears in my heart I (the Holy Prophet [S] kiss Fatemeh. 2) Maryam (Mary) (SA) was the greatest woman of her time, but my daughter Fatemeh is the greatest woman of the whole world, from the first to the last. 3) The first person to come to me in heaven will be Fatemeh. 4) Aisha reported, ”There was no man near to Prophet (S) who was more love than Ali (AS) and not of the women more loved than Fatemeh.” 5) Referring to one of the verses of the Qoran, Fatemeh (SA) said: “After this verse was revealed I did not dare to call my father dear and when I went to him I would say, O, Messenger of God.” One or two times after I repeated this address, I saw that the Prophet (S) became upset and turned his face away from me, the third time he turned to me and said, “O, Fatemeh, this verse was not revealed for you, and not for your family and descendants, you are of me and I am of you. This was revealed in relation to the oppressors and ill-mannered of the Quraish.” 6) The Holy Prophet (S) said, “Whoever harms her, surely has harmed me, and whoever angers her, surely has made me angry; whoever makes her glad, has surely made me glad, and whoever saddens her, surely has made me sad.” Heavenly Lady's Personality Fatemeh Zahra (SA) is the only shining jewel of the creation, a luminous star, a bright star in the heavens of sainthood, the intermediary for earthly and heavenly creation, the wise one, the daughter and a part of the flesh of Holy Prophet (S), the worthy wife of the commander of the faithful, Imam Ali (AS), unparalleled heroine throughout the history of Islam. Lady Fatemeh (SA) always appearing as the manifestation of self-sacrifice, bravery, affection, abundant generosity in the way of the presentation of Islam and the Qoran and support of the Imamate. Her value and personality is so high that in many places the Holy Qoran talks about her, such as the following: 1) The revelation of verse 33 of chapter 33 of the Holy Qoran When the Holy Prophet (S) gathered all four people, Ali (AS), Hassan (AS), Hussein (AS), and Fatemeh (SA), under a woolen cloak, Gabriel revealed: “Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House, and to purify you a (thorough) purifying." Every one would be aware as to who was considered the Holy Prophet’s (S) Household. It was only after this event that these five, the Prophet, Fatemeh (AS), her husband Ali (AS) and her two children Hassan and Hussein (AS) were known as “Companions of Cloak”. 2) Event of Mubahela (Mutual Invocation of a Curse) Where, as per the Divine command, the Holy Prophet (S), called the Christians of Najran for “Mubahela,” then this verse was revealed. “Truth is from your Lord. So do not allow doubt to enter yourself. Then to the one who quarrels and disputes with you after having knowledge and awareness (about Jesus Christ), say: “Let us call our children and your children, our women and your women, our beloved ones and your beloved ones and then engage in mutual invocation of cursing (Mubahela) until the curse of God descends upon the group telling the lie,” (Holy Qoran). In complying with this divine command, the Holy Prophet (S) appeared on the scene of Mubahela along with Hassanain (AS), the two children of lady Fatemeh (SA), and Ali (AS). 3) Revelation of 76th chapter of Holy Qoran, to show us the strength of sacrifice. When the news of the sickness of the Hassanian, the two sons of lady Fatemeh (AS), reached Holy Prophet (S), his heart began to beat and became impatient, he rushed to visit them. Two other people accompanied him. The Holy Prophet (S) patted his two sons with his kind hands and prayed for their recovery from the depth of his heart. One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) gave a suggestion to Ali (AS) to make a vow (Nazr) for their recovery that whenever they regain their health he would fulfill his vow. His wife lady Fatemeh (SA), the children and Fizzah, the loyal maid of the house, also made the same decision that when the children recovered from the illness they would keep fast for three days. In those times the Muslims were living in severe poverty and were destitute. Most of the close companions of the Holy Prophet (S) did not even have food to eat every day. The Holy Prophet (S) and most Muslims were experiencing lives of hardship. Like the other people, Ali (AS), too, had nothing at all. When the two children recovered from their illness, all of them fasted on the next day. Any how, after Ali (AS) brought a measure of barley, Fatemeh Zahra (AS) baked five loaves of bread, for each of them one loaf. At the time of breaking the fast (sunset), when all sat around the table cloth, Ali (AS) took the first morsel of bread to eat when suddenly a sorrowful cry of a poor man who was standing outside the door was heard. “Peace and salutations be upon you (all), O household of Mohammad (S),the messenger of God, I am a helpless, needy Muslim; give me also from whatever you eat, so that God may give you in exchange a table of food from paradise.” On hearing the cry of that disappointed poor man, Ali (AS) and the other four members of the holy house decided to help him and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) picked up all that was on the table cloth and gave it to that poor man. That night, they broke their fast with water and went to sleep hungry. The next day they once again fasted and then again at the time of breaking the fast an orphan knocked on the door and asked for help. That night too, they broke their fast with water and all went to sleep more hungry than the previous night. The next day, they again fasted. The third day, there was no longer strength. It was two days that they had not eaten food. Hunger was severely tormenting them. They sat beside the table cloth, but as Ali (AS) picked up the first morsel of bread, a captive greeted them loudly and asked for food and for the third time, this holy family donated their meals (only bread) to the needy man. When the Holy Prophet (S) realized that they had eaten nothing for three days, he said, "I take refuge in Allah. It is three days that you all are in such a state, and I am unaware of your condition." Yes, the Holy Prophet (S) was not aware what his most beloved ones had to suffer in this period of time; however the God of the Prophet (S) knew what had happened and knew the splendor and magnificence of the sacrifice of these chosen ones of creation. For this reason Gabriel descended and addressed the Holy Prophet (S), saying, “O, Mohammad, take away what God has prepared for your household members.” The Messenger of God asked, "What should I take?" Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib. You also marry her to Ali on earth.'” The extraordinary virtue of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) one side and on the other side, her blood relations with the Prophet (S) and still on another side, the nobility of her family, caused many of the high-ranking supporters of the Prophet (S) to propose to her, but all received negative answers. The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).

                  It was thus that this great child from a father such as the Holy Prophet (S) and mother such as Khadijeh (SA), the first woman to believe in Islam, the loyal wife of the Holy Prophet (S), on the 20th day of Jamadi al-Thani in the eighth year before the hijra (615 C.E.) came into the world. And the taunts and reproaches of the Prophet’s opponents, that he was as they thought without a succeeding generation, were all made in vain. No one can forget the condition of Khadijeh (SA) at that historic and divine moment. As narrators report, “As the difficult, critical moments of giving birth began, she was alone in her home, and not a woman who could aid her was there. Her heart grew heavier, and the roaring waves of the people’s unkindness tormented her pure soul. Suddenly there shone a flash on the horizon of her soul, she opened her eyes and saw four women near her, and she became greatly worried. One of the four women called, “Be not afraid, nor sad. Your kind God has sent us to your aid, we are your sisters.” “I am Sarah! And this is Asiyah, the wife of Pharaoh who will be one of your friends in heaven. The other is Maryam (SA, the daughter of Imran. And this fourth that you see is the sister of Musa son of Imran Kulthum! We have come so that at this hour we may be of aid to you.” And they remained with her until Fatemeh (SA), the lady of Islam, opened her eyes to the world. (Tabray in Zakharato-al Ughba). That is why the Holy Prophet (S) points out in following verse: “(As for) those who say, our Lord is Allah, then continue in the right way, the angels descend upon them, saying, Fear not, nor be grieved, Not only Angels, but women of high worldly status rushed to the aid of the first believing woman of Islam, Khadijeh (SA).” The birth of this auspicious child so pleased the Prophet (S) that he began speaking in praise and eulogy of Allah, and the tongues of the ill-wishers who called him “Abtar” (which means man without offspring) were forever silenced.

Name and Titles of the Heavenly Lady This heavenly lady had many names and titles, each being more meaningful than the other. The following are the most popular: 1) Fatemeh: its root is Fatm, meaning being separated or taken off from milk. The Holy Prophet (S), in a very authentic tradition accepted by both Sunni and Shia, asked Ali (AS), the commander of the faithful: "Do you know why my daughter was named Fatemeh?" Ali (AS) replied: “Please say so.” The Holy Prophet (S) said, “Because she and the Shia, the followers of her way, are separated from the fires of hell." 2) Zahra means shining. When Imam Sadeq (AS) was asked why they call Fatemeh Zahra, he replied: “Because Zahra means shining and Fatemeh was such that when she stood in mehrab of prayer, her light was a radiance for the inhabitants of the skies (heavens) just as the light of the stars is for the inhabitants of the earth.  Therefore she was given the name Zahra." 3) Seddiqeh (most truthful lady) 4) Tahereh (pure lady) 5) Mobarakeh (blessed lady) 6) Zakieh (purified lady) 7) Razieh (lady Allah is satisfied with) 8) Marzieh (Allah is satisfied with her) 9) Mohaddatheh (narrator of the traditions) Prophet’s Love of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) The Holy Prophet (S) many times said: "Fatemeh is a part of me and the light of my eyes, the fruit of my heart, and my soul …. And she is a Huri [woman of paradise] with human qualities.” All of the historians and masters of the traditions (hadith) have written that the Prophet (S) had an astonishing attachment to his daughter Fatemeh Zahra (SA). No doubt the Prophet’s affection was not only because of their relationship as father and child, even though this sentiment swelled the Prophet’s being, the phrases and words the Prophet (S) spoke when he expressed his affection for his daughter Fatemeh Zahra (SA) showed that there was something else. The affection was unique. The Love of the beloved of God is the love of God. Following are some traditions quoted from authentic Shia and Sunni sources: 1) Whenever the desire for heaven appears in my heart I (the Holy Prophet [S] kiss Fatemeh. 2) Maryam (Mary) (SA) was the greatest woman of her time, but my daughter Fatemeh is the greatest woman of the whole world, from the first to the last. 3) The first person to come to me in heaven will be Fatemeh. 4) Aisha reported, ”There was no man near to Prophet (S) who was more love than Ali (AS) and not of the women more loved than Fatemeh.” 5) Referring to one of the verses of the Qoran, Fatemeh (SA) said: “After this verse was revealed I did not dare to call my father dear and when I went to him I would say, O, Messenger of God.” One or two times after I repeated this address, I saw that the Prophet (S) became upset and turned his face away from me, the third time he turned to me and said, “O, Fatemeh, this verse was not revealed for you, and not for your family and descendants, you are of me and I am of you. This was revealed in relation to the oppressors and ill-mannered of the Quraish.” 6) The Holy Prophet (S) said, “Whoever harms her, surely has harmed me, and whoever angers her, surely has made me angry; whoever makes her glad, has surely made me glad, and whoever saddens her, surely has made me sad.” Heavenly Lady's Personality Fatemeh Zahra (SA) is the only shining jewel of the creation, a luminous star, a bright star in the heavens of sainthood, the intermediary for earthly and heavenly creation, the wise one, the daughter and a part of the flesh of Holy Prophet (S), the worthy wife of the commander of the faithful, Imam Ali (AS), unparalleled heroine throughout the history of Islam. Lady Fatemeh (SA) always appearing as the manifestation of self-sacrifice, bravery, affection, abundant generosity in the way of the presentation of Islam and the Qoran and support of the Imamate. Her value and personality is so high that in many places the Holy Qoran talks about her, such as the following: 1) The revelation of verse 33 of chapter 33 of the Holy Qoran When the Holy Prophet (S) gathered all four people, Ali (AS), Hassan (AS), Hussein (AS), and Fatemeh (SA), under a woolen cloak, Gabriel revealed: “Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House, and to purify you a (thorough) purifying." Every one would be aware as to who was considered the Holy Prophet’s (S) Household. It was only after this event that these five, the Prophet, Fatemeh (AS), her husband Ali (AS) and her two children Hassan and Hussein (AS) were known as “Companions of Cloak”. 2) Event of Mubahela (Mutual Invocation of a Curse) Where, as per the Divine command, the Holy Prophet (S), called the Christians of Najran for “Mubahela,” then this verse was revealed. “Truth is from your Lord. So do not allow doubt to enter yourself. Then to the one who quarrels and disputes with you after having knowledge and awareness (about Jesus Christ), say: “Let us call our children and your children, our women and your women, our beloved ones and your beloved ones and then engage in mutual invocation of cursing (Mubahela) until the curse of God descends upon the group telling the lie,” (Holy Qoran). In complying with this divine command, the Holy Prophet (S) appeared on the scene of Mubahela along with Hassanain (AS), the two children of lady Fatemeh (SA), and Ali (AS). 3) Revelation of 76th chapter of Holy Qoran, to show us the strength of sacrifice. When the news of the sickness of the Hassanian, the two sons of lady Fatemeh (AS), reached Holy Prophet (S), his heart began to beat and became impatient, he rushed to visit them. Two other people accompanied him. The Holy Prophet (S) patted his two sons with his kind hands and prayed for their recovery from the depth of his heart. One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) gave a suggestion to Ali (AS) to make a vow (Nazr) for their recovery that whenever they regain their health he would fulfill his vow. His wife lady Fatemeh (SA), the children and Fizzah, the loyal maid of the house, also made the same decision that when the children recovered from the illness they would keep fast for three days. In those times the Muslims were living in severe poverty and were destitute. Most of the close companions of the Holy Prophet (S) did not even have food to eat every day. The Holy Prophet (S) and most Muslims were experiencing lives of hardship. Like the other people, Ali (AS), too, had nothing at all. When the two children recovered from their illness, all of them fasted on the next day. Any how, after Ali (AS) brought a measure of barley, Fatemeh Zahra (AS) baked five loaves of bread, for each of them one loaf. At the time of breaking the fast (sunset), when all sat around the table cloth, Ali (AS) took the first morsel of bread to eat when suddenly a sorrowful cry of a poor man who was standing outside the door was heard. “Peace and salutations be upon you (all), O household of Mohammad (S),the messenger of God, I am a helpless, needy Muslim; give me also from whatever you eat, so that God may give you in exchange a table of food from paradise.” On hearing the cry of that disappointed poor man, Ali (AS) and the other four members of the holy house decided to help him and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) picked up all that was on the table cloth and gave it to that poor man. That night, they broke their fast with water and went to sleep hungry. The next day they once again fasted and then again at the time of breaking the fast an orphan knocked on the door and asked for help. That night too, they broke their fast with water and all went to sleep more hungry than the previous night. The next day, they again fasted. The third day, there was no longer strength. It was two days that they had not eaten food. Hunger was severely tormenting them. They sat beside the table cloth, but as Ali (AS) picked up the first morsel of bread, a captive greeted them loudly and asked for food and for the third time, this holy family donated their meals (only bread) to the needy man. When the Holy Prophet (S) realized that they had eaten nothing for three days, he said, "I take refuge in Allah. It is three days that you all are in such a state, and I am unaware of your condition." Yes, the Holy Prophet (S) was not aware what his most beloved ones had to suffer in this period of time; however the God of the Prophet (S) knew what had happened and knew the splendor and magnificence of the sacrifice of these chosen ones of creation. For this reason Gabriel descended and addressed the Holy Prophet (S), saying, “O, Mohammad, take away what God has prepared for your household members.” The Messenger of God asked, "What should I take?" Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib. You also marry her to Ali on earth.'” The extraordinary virtue of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) one side and on the other side, her blood relations with the Prophet (S) and still on another side, the nobility of her family, caused many of the high-ranking supporters of the Prophet (S) to propose to her, but all received negative answers. The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).
                  The birth of this auspicious child so pleased the Prophet (S) that he began speaking in praise and eulogy of Allah, and the tongues of the ill-wishers who called him “Abtar” (which means man without offspring) were forever silenced. Almighty Allah gave glad tidings of this blessed child to the Prophet (S) in the Holy Qoran in a chapter named Kauthar (heavenly fountain of unbounded grace and benefits): “In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, (1) Surely we have given you Kauthar, (2) So pray unto your Lord and make a sacrifice, (3) Surely your enemy is the one who shall be without posterity."

And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib. You also marry her to Ali on earth.'” The extraordinary virtue of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) one side and on the other side, her blood relations with the Prophet (S) and still on another side, the nobility of her family, caused many of the high-ranking supporters of the Prophet (S) to propose to her, but all received negative answers. The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).
                  All of the historians and masters of the traditions (hadith) have written that the Prophet (S) had an astonishing attachment to his daughter Fatemeh Zahra (SA). No doubt the Prophet’s affection was not only because of their relationship as father and child, even though this sentiment swelled the Prophet’s being, the phrases and words the Prophet (S) spoke when he expressed his affection for his daughter Fatemeh Zahra (SA) showed that there was something else. The affection was unique. The Love of the beloved of God is the love of God. Following are some traditions quoted from authentic Shia and Sunni sources: 1) Whenever the desire for heaven appears in my heart I (the Holy Prophet [S] kiss Fatemeh. 2) Maryam (Mary) (SA) was the greatest woman of her time, but my daughter Fatemeh is the greatest woman of the whole world, from the first to the last. 3) The first person to come to me in heaven will be Fatemeh. 4) Aisha reported, ”There was no man near to Prophet (S) who was more love than Ali (AS) and not of the women more loved than Fatemeh.” 5) Referring to one of the verses of the Qoran, Fatemeh (SA) said: “After this verse was revealed I did not dare to call my father dear and when I went to him I would say, O, Messenger of God.” One or two times after I repeated this address, I saw that the Prophet (S) became upset and turned his face away from me, the third time he turned to me and said, “O, Fatemeh, this verse was not revealed for you, and not for your family and descendants, you are of me and I am of you. This was revealed in relation to the oppressors and ill-mannered of the Quraish.” 6) The Holy Prophet (S) said, “Whoever harms her, surely has harmed me, and whoever angers her, surely has made me angry; whoever makes her glad, has surely made me glad, and whoever saddens her, surely has made me sad.” Heavenly Lady's Personality Fatemeh Zahra (SA) is the only shining jewel of the creation, a luminous star, a bright star in the heavens of sainthood, the intermediary for earthly and heavenly creation, the wise one, the daughter and a part of the flesh of Holy Prophet (S), the worthy wife of the commander of the faithful, Imam Ali (AS), unparalleled heroine throughout the history of Islam. Lady Fatemeh (SA) always appearing as the manifestation of self-sacrifice, bravery, affection, abundant generosity in the way of the presentation of Islam and the Qoran and support of the Imamate. Her value and personality is so high that in many places the Holy Qoran talks about her, such as the following: 1) The revelation of verse 33 of chapter 33 of the Holy Qoran When the Holy Prophet (S) gathered all four people, Ali (AS), Hassan (AS), Hussein (AS), and Fatemeh (SA), under a woolen cloak, Gabriel revealed: “Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House, and to purify you a (thorough) purifying." Every one would be aware as to who was considered the Holy Prophet’s (S) Household. It was only after this event that these five, the Prophet, Fatemeh (AS), her husband Ali (AS) and her two children Hassan and Hussein (AS) were known as “Companions of Cloak”. 2) Event of Mubahela (Mutual Invocation of a Curse) Where, as per the Divine command, the Holy Prophet (S), called the Christians of Najran for “Mubahela,” then this verse was revealed. “Truth is from your Lord. So do not allow doubt to enter yourself. Then to the one who quarrels and disputes with you after having knowledge and awareness (about Jesus Christ), say: “Let us call our children and your children, our women and your women, our beloved ones and your beloved ones and then engage in mutual invocation of cursing (Mubahela) until the curse of God descends upon the group telling the lie,” (Holy Qoran). In complying with this divine command, the Holy Prophet (S) appeared on the scene of Mubahela along with Hassanain (AS), the two children of lady Fatemeh (SA), and Ali (AS). 3) Revelation of 76th chapter of Holy Qoran, to show us the strength of sacrifice. When the news of the sickness of the Hassanian, the two sons of lady Fatemeh (AS), reached Holy Prophet (S), his heart began to beat and became impatient, he rushed to visit them. Two other people accompanied him. The Holy Prophet (S) patted his two sons with his kind hands and prayed for their recovery from the depth of his heart. One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) gave a suggestion to Ali (AS) to make a vow (Nazr) for their recovery that whenever they regain their health he would fulfill his vow. His wife lady Fatemeh (SA), the children and Fizzah, the loyal maid of the house, also made the same decision that when the children recovered from the illness they would keep fast for three days. In those times the Muslims were living in severe poverty and were destitute. Most of the close companions of the Holy Prophet (S) did not even have food to eat every day. The Holy Prophet (S) and most Muslims were experiencing lives of hardship. Like the other people, Ali (AS), too, had nothing at all. When the two children recovered from their illness, all of them fasted on the next day. Any how, after Ali (AS) brought a measure of barley, Fatemeh Zahra (AS) baked five loaves of bread, for each of them one loaf. At the time of breaking the fast (sunset), when all sat around the table cloth, Ali (AS) took the first morsel of bread to eat when suddenly a sorrowful cry of a poor man who was standing outside the door was heard. “Peace and salutations be upon you (all), O household of Mohammad (S),the messenger of God, I am a helpless, needy Muslim; give me also from whatever you eat, so that God may give you in exchange a table of food from paradise.” On hearing the cry of that disappointed poor man, Ali (AS) and the other four members of the holy house decided to help him and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) picked up all that was on the table cloth and gave it to that poor man. That night, they broke their fast with water and went to sleep hungry. The next day they once again fasted and then again at the time of breaking the fast an orphan knocked on the door and asked for help. That night too, they broke their fast with water and all went to sleep more hungry than the previous night. The next day, they again fasted. The third day, there was no longer strength. It was two days that they had not eaten food. Hunger was severely tormenting them. They sat beside the table cloth, but as Ali (AS) picked up the first morsel of bread, a captive greeted them loudly and asked for food and for the third time, this holy family donated their meals (only bread) to the needy man. When the Holy Prophet (S) realized that they had eaten nothing for three days, he said, "I take refuge in Allah. It is three days that you all are in such a state, and I am unaware of your condition." Yes, the Holy Prophet (S) was not aware what his most beloved ones had to suffer in this period of time; however the God of the Prophet (S) knew what had happened and knew the splendor and magnificence of the sacrifice of these chosen ones of creation. For this reason Gabriel descended and addressed the Holy Prophet (S), saying, “O, Mohammad, take away what God has prepared for your household members.” The Messenger of God asked, "What should I take?" Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive.

The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).
                  [S] kiss Fatemeh. 2) Maryam (Mary) (SA) was the greatest woman of her time, but my daughter Fatemeh is the greatest woman of the whole world, from the first to the last. 3) The first person to come to me in heaven will be Fatemeh. 4) Aisha reported, ”There was no man near to Prophet (S) who was more love than Ali (AS) and not of the women more loved than Fatemeh.” 5) Referring to one of the verses of the Qoran, Fatemeh (SA) said: “After this verse was revealed I did not dare to call my father dear and when I went to him I would say, O, Messenger of God.” One or two times after I repeated this address, I saw that the Prophet (S) became upset and turned his face away from me, the third time he turned to me and said, “O, Fatemeh, this verse was not revealed for you, and not for your family and descendants, you are of me and I am of you. This was revealed in relation to the oppressors and ill-mannered of the Quraish.” 6) The Holy Prophet (S) said, “Whoever harms her, surely has harmed me, and whoever angers her, surely has made me angry; whoever makes her glad, has surely made me glad, and whoever saddens her, surely has made me sad.” Heavenly Lady's Personality Fatemeh Zahra (SA) is the only shining jewel of the creation, a luminous star, a bright star in the heavens of sainthood, the intermediary for earthly and heavenly creation, the wise one, the daughter and a part of the flesh of Holy Prophet (S), the worthy wife of the commander of the faithful, Imam Ali (AS), unparalleled heroine throughout the history of Islam. Lady Fatemeh (SA) always appearing as the manifestation of self-sacrifice, bravery, affection, abundant generosity in the way of the presentation of Islam and the Qoran and support of the Imamate. Her value and personality is so high that in many places the Holy Qoran talks about her, such as the following: 1) The revelation of verse 33 of chapter 33 of the Holy Qoran When the Holy Prophet (S) gathered all four people, Ali (AS), Hassan (AS), Hussein (AS), and Fatemeh (SA), under a woolen cloak, Gabriel revealed: “Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House, and to purify you a (thorough) purifying." Every one would be aware as to who was considered the Holy Prophet’s (S) Household. It was only after this event that these five, the Prophet, Fatemeh (AS), her husband Ali (AS) and her two children Hassan and Hussein (AS) were known as “Companions of Cloak”. 2) Event of Mubahela (Mutual Invocation of a Curse) Where, as per the Divine command, the Holy Prophet (S), called the Christians of Najran for “Mubahela,” then this verse was revealed. “Truth is from your Lord. So do not allow doubt to enter yourself. Then to the one who quarrels and disputes with you after having knowledge and awareness (about Jesus Christ), say: “Let us call our children and your children, our women and your women, our beloved ones and your beloved ones and then engage in mutual invocation of cursing (Mubahela) until the curse of God descends upon the group telling the lie,” (Holy Qoran). In complying with this divine command, the Holy Prophet (S) appeared on the scene of Mubahela along with Hassanain (AS), the two children of lady Fatemeh (SA), and Ali (AS). 3) Revelation of 76th chapter of Holy Qoran, to show us the strength of sacrifice. When the news of the sickness of the Hassanian, the two sons of lady Fatemeh (AS), reached Holy Prophet (S), his heart began to beat and became impatient, he rushed to visit them. Two other people accompanied him. The Holy Prophet (S) patted his two sons with his kind hands and prayed for their recovery from the depth of his heart. One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) gave a suggestion to Ali (AS) to make a vow (Nazr) for their recovery that whenever they regain their health he would fulfill his vow. His wife lady Fatemeh (SA), the children and Fizzah, the loyal maid of the house, also made the same decision that when the children recovered from the illness they would keep fast for three days. In those times the Muslims were living in severe poverty and were destitute. Most of the close companions of the Holy Prophet (S) did not even have food to eat every day. The Holy Prophet (S) and most Muslims were experiencing lives of hardship. Like the other people, Ali (AS), too, had nothing at all. When the two children recovered from their illness, all of them fasted on the next day. Any how, after Ali (AS) brought a measure of barley, Fatemeh Zahra (AS) baked five loaves of bread, for each of them one loaf. At the time of breaking the fast (sunset), when all sat around the table cloth, Ali (AS) took the first morsel of bread to eat when suddenly a sorrowful cry of a poor man who was standing outside the door was heard. “Peace and salutations be upon you (all), O household of Mohammad (S),the messenger of God, I am a helpless, needy Muslim; give me also from whatever you eat, so that God may give you in exchange a table of food from paradise.” On hearing the cry of that disappointed poor man, Ali (AS) and the other four members of the holy house decided to help him and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) picked up all that was on the table cloth and gave it to that poor man. That night, they broke their fast with water and went to sleep hungry. The next day they once again fasted and then again at the time of breaking the fast an orphan knocked on the door and asked for help. That night too, they broke their fast with water and all went to sleep more hungry than the previous night. The next day, they again fasted. The third day, there was no longer strength. It was two days that they had not eaten food. Hunger was severely tormenting them. They sat beside the table cloth, but as Ali (AS) picked up the first morsel of bread, a captive greeted them loudly and asked for food and for the third time, this holy family donated their meals (only bread) to the needy man. When the Holy Prophet (S) realized that they had eaten nothing for three days, he said, "I take refuge in Allah. It is three days that you all are in such a state, and I am unaware of your condition." Yes, the Holy Prophet (S) was not aware what his most beloved ones had to suffer in this period of time; however the God of the Prophet (S) knew what had happened and knew the splendor and magnificence of the sacrifice of these chosen ones of creation. For this reason Gabriel descended and addressed the Holy Prophet (S), saying, “O, Mohammad, take away what God has prepared for your household members.” The Messenger of God asked, "What should I take?" Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib.

Every one would be aware as to who was considered the Holy Prophet’s (S) Household. It was only after this event that these five, the Prophet, Fatemeh (AS), her husband Ali (AS) and her two children Hassan and Hussein (AS) were known as “Companions of Cloak”. 2) Event of Mubahela (Mutual Invocation of a Curse) Where, as per the Divine command, the Holy Prophet (S), called the Christians of Najran for “Mubahela,” then this verse was revealed. “Truth is from your Lord. So do not allow doubt to enter yourself. Then to the one who quarrels and disputes with you after having knowledge and awareness (about Jesus Christ), say: “Let us call our children and your children, our women and your women, our beloved ones and your beloved ones and then engage in mutual invocation of cursing (Mubahela) until the curse of God descends upon the group telling the lie,” (Holy Qoran). In complying with this divine command, the Holy Prophet (S) appeared on the scene of Mubahela along with Hassanain (AS), the two children of lady Fatemeh (SA), and Ali (AS). 3) Revelation of 76th chapter of Holy Qoran, to show us the strength of sacrifice. When the news of the sickness of the Hassanian, the two sons of lady Fatemeh (AS), reached Holy Prophet (S), his heart began to beat and became impatient, he rushed to visit them. Two other people accompanied him. The Holy Prophet (S) patted his two sons with his kind hands and prayed for their recovery from the depth of his heart. One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) gave a suggestion to Ali (AS) to make a vow (Nazr) for their recovery that whenever they regain their health he would fulfill his vow. His wife lady Fatemeh (SA), the children and Fizzah, the loyal maid of the house, also made the same decision that when the children recovered from the illness they would keep fast for three days. In those times the Muslims were living in severe poverty and were destitute. Most of the close companions of the Holy Prophet (S) did not even have food to eat every day. The Holy Prophet (S) and most Muslims were experiencing lives of hardship. Like the other people, Ali (AS), too, had nothing at all. When the two children recovered from their illness, all of them fasted on the next day. Any how, after Ali (AS) brought a measure of barley, Fatemeh Zahra (AS) baked five loaves of bread, for each of them one loaf. At the time of breaking the fast (sunset), when all sat around the table cloth, Ali (AS) took the first morsel of bread to eat when suddenly a sorrowful cry of a poor man who was standing outside the door was heard. “Peace and salutations be upon you (all), O household of Mohammad (S),the messenger of God, I am a helpless, needy Muslim; give me also from whatever you eat, so that God may give you in exchange a table of food from paradise.” On hearing the cry of that disappointed poor man, Ali (AS) and the other four members of the holy house decided to help him and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) picked up all that was on the table cloth and gave it to that poor man. That night, they broke their fast with water and went to sleep hungry. The next day they once again fasted and then again at the time of breaking the fast an orphan knocked on the door and asked for help. That night too, they broke their fast with water and all went to sleep more hungry than the previous night. The next day, they again fasted. The third day, there was no longer strength. It was two days that they had not eaten food. Hunger was severely tormenting them. They sat beside the table cloth, but as Ali (AS) picked up the first morsel of bread, a captive greeted them loudly and asked for food and for the third time, this holy family donated their meals (only bread) to the needy man. When the Holy Prophet (S) realized that they had eaten nothing for three days, he said, "I take refuge in Allah. It is three days that you all are in such a state, and I am unaware of your condition." Yes, the Holy Prophet (S) was not aware what his most beloved ones had to suffer in this period of time; however the God of the Prophet (S) knew what had happened and knew the splendor and magnificence of the sacrifice of these chosen ones of creation. For this reason Gabriel descended and addressed the Holy Prophet (S), saying, “O, Mohammad, take away what God has prepared for your household members.” The Messenger of God asked, "What should I take?" Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib. You also marry her to Ali on earth.'” The extraordinary virtue of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) one side and on the other side, her blood relations with the Prophet (S) and still on another side, the nobility of her family, caused many of the high-ranking supporters of the Prophet (S) to propose to her, but all received negative answers. The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).

When the two children recovered from their illness, all of them fasted on the next day. Any how, after Ali (AS) brought a measure of barley, Fatemeh Zahra (AS) baked five loaves of bread, for each of them one loaf. At the time of breaking the fast (sunset), when all sat around the table cloth, Ali (AS) took the first morsel of bread to eat when suddenly a sorrowful cry of a poor man who was standing outside the door was heard. “Peace and salutations be upon you (all), O household of Mohammad (S),the messenger of God, I am a helpless, needy Muslim; give me also from whatever you eat, so that God may give you in exchange a table of food from paradise.” On hearing the cry of that disappointed poor man, Ali (AS) and the other four members of the holy house decided to help him and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) picked up all that was on the table cloth and gave it to that poor man. That night, they broke their fast with water and went to sleep hungry. The next day they once again fasted and then again at the time of breaking the fast an orphan knocked on the door and asked for help. That night too, they broke their fast with water and all went to sleep more hungry than the previous night. The next day, they again fasted. The third day, there was no longer strength. It was two days that they had not eaten food. Hunger was severely tormenting them. They sat beside the table cloth, but as Ali (AS) picked up the first morsel of bread, a captive greeted them loudly and asked for food and for the third time, this holy family donated their meals (only bread) to the needy man. When the Holy Prophet (S) realized that they had eaten nothing for three days, he said, "I take refuge in Allah. It is three days that you all are in such a state, and I am unaware of your condition." Yes, the Holy Prophet (S) was not aware what his most beloved ones had to suffer in this period of time; however the God of the Prophet (S) knew what had happened and knew the splendor and magnificence of the sacrifice of these chosen ones of creation. For this reason Gabriel descended and addressed the Holy Prophet (S), saying, “O, Mohammad, take away what God has prepared for your household members.” The Messenger of God asked, "What should I take?" Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib. You also marry her to Ali on earth.'” The extraordinary virtue of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) one side and on the other side, her blood relations with the Prophet (S) and still on another side, the nobility of her family, caused many of the high-ranking supporters of the Prophet (S) to propose to her, but all received negative answers. The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).
                  3) Revelation of 76th chapter of Holy Qoran, to show us the strength of sacrifice. When the news of the sickness of the Hassanian, the two sons of lady Fatemeh (AS), reached Holy Prophet (S), his heart began to beat and became impatient, he rushed to visit them. Two other people accompanied him. The Holy Prophet (S) patted his two sons with his kind hands and prayed for their recovery from the depth of his heart. One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) gave a suggestion to Ali (AS) to make a vow (Nazr) for their recovery that whenever they regain their health he would fulfill his vow. His wife lady Fatemeh (SA), the children and Fizzah, the loyal maid of the house, also made the same decision that when the children recovered from the illness they would keep fast for three days. In those times the Muslims were living in severe poverty and were destitute. Most of the close companions of the Holy Prophet (S) did not even have food to eat every day. The Holy Prophet (S) and most Muslims were experiencing lives of hardship. Like the other people, Ali (AS), too, had nothing at all.

At the time of breaking the fast (sunset), when all sat around the table cloth, Ali (AS) took the first morsel of bread to eat when suddenly a sorrowful cry of a poor man who was standing outside the door was heard. “Peace and salutations be upon you (all), O household of Mohammad (S),the messenger of God, I am a helpless, needy Muslim; give me also from whatever you eat, so that God may give you in exchange a table of food from paradise.” On hearing the cry of that disappointed poor man, Ali (AS) and the other four members of the holy house decided to help him and Fatemeh Zahra (SA) picked up all that was on the table cloth and gave it to that poor man. That night, they broke their fast with water and went to sleep hungry. The next day they once again fasted and then again at the time of breaking the fast an orphan knocked on the door and asked for help. That night too, they broke their fast with water and all went to sleep more hungry than the previous night. The next day, they again fasted. The third day, there was no longer strength. It was two days that they had not eaten food. Hunger was severely tormenting them. They sat beside the table cloth, but as Ali (AS) picked up the first morsel of bread, a captive greeted them loudly and asked for food and for the third time, this holy family donated their meals (only bread) to the needy man. When the Holy Prophet (S) realized that they had eaten nothing for three days, he said, "I take refuge in Allah. It is three days that you all are in such a state, and I am unaware of your condition." Yes, the Holy Prophet (S) was not aware what his most beloved ones had to suffer in this period of time; however the God of the Prophet (S) knew what had happened and knew the splendor and magnificence of the sacrifice of these chosen ones of creation. For this reason Gabriel descended and addressed the Holy Prophet (S), saying, “O, Mohammad, take away what God has prepared for your household members.” The Messenger of God asked, "What should I take?" Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib. You also marry her to Ali on earth.'” The extraordinary virtue of Fatemeh Zahra (SA) one side and on the other side, her blood relations with the Prophet (S) and still on another side, the nobility of her family, caused many of the high-ranking supporters of the Prophet (S) to propose to her, but all received negative answers. The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).

The interesting point here being that the Prophet (S) would usually answer them saying “Fatemeh’s matter (of marriage) is in the hands of God.” And in many places his holiness said, “In the event that Ali (AS) would not have been created, there would have been no one worthy to be Fatemeh’s spouse.” The wedding ceremony took place and the honorable Prophet of Islam (S) initiated a program that made his enemies angry and his friends proud, the establishment of a family by which an important part of Islam’s history was changed and of which the Infallible successors of the Holy Prophet (S) would all come into existence, especially their descendant Imam Mahdi (AS). At the end of ceremony when all of the people had returned to their houses, his holiness prayed for them, saying, “O, Allah: They (Ali and Fatemeh )are of me and I am of them, o Allah, just as you removed every kind of filth and impurity from me, also remove it from them making them pure.” Hessan, the famous Persian poet has nicely described the prestige and personality of this heavenly lady. It is here presented to all her true followers as translated by Michele Ahmadi: “It is I (Fatemeh), God’s immaculate, and ornamentation of the thrones’ front leg. The beloved of God, is I, I am the intermediary of His Light, Pleasing me is pleasing Him Friendship with me is friendship with Him For I am God’s elect and purified of every wrong Ali is the blood and essence of Mohammad, it is I, the Prophet’s flesh and commensurate with Ali Upon this throne of Power I have sat, at their side On this growth of glory, I am the single gem Except for Mohammad and Ali of which our light was one I am superior to the Prophets and Saints of God. The Prophet said publicly: if there was not Ali, no one else could be my husband Ali is a shooting star and I am the evening star’s brightness By the culmination of purity and modesty in every era, I am illuminated A sapling of divine love, in the spring of eternal virtue Mohammad’s flower bud, a gift of the Lord and the abundant fountain (kauthar) Hassan and Hussein adorn me as two earrings Ali is the necklace upon my neck, Mohammad is my crown Mohammad and Ali and I are the essence and source of creation It is I in this regard who I smother, what display was (fadak) of my wealth? When the ownership of paradise was in my hand, just as my father was I rose against the usurpers of Fadak to show the Jihad-filled way of God to my daughter Hassan is the Prophet’s love and the progeny of Mostafa (Ali) was My hope in purgatory and refuge on the Day of Judgment I am hope in purgatory, and refugee on the judgment day” Wishing all readers a blessed birth anniversary of Lady Fatemeh Zahra (SA).
                  Thereafter Gabriel recited chapter 76 of the Holy Qoran for the Prophet (S), which was revealed on the occasion of this great incident, and the story of the sacrifice of this household, especially Lady Fatemeh (SA), became eternal. “Surely, the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor, A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink. They make it to flow a goodly flowing forth. They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be speaking far and wise. And they give food out of love for him to the poor, and the orphan and the captive. We only feed you for Allah’s sake, we desire from you neither reward nor thanks." 4) Fatemeh Zahra (SA) the Loyal Wife of Ali (AS) The Holy Prophet said, “An angel of God came to me and said, 'God sends you greetings and says that in heaven I have made Fatemeh the wife of Ali son of Abutalib.
