Gahvareh-bandan ritual is held on the tenth day after the birth of a baby in Gilan province, northern Iran. During the ritual, which literally means cradle-bonding, family members and relatives gather at the new parentsâ€™ home and maternal grandmother puts the newborn in the cradle for the first time. The guests dine with sweets, almonds, walnuts and fruits. The grandmother puts the baby three times in the cradle praying for his or her health and prosperity. She breaks a walnut on the handle of the cradle wishing the newborn to become a wise person. The invitees bring gifts, which include clothes or pieces of gold, to the ceremony. Various tribes and ethnic groups who live in different parts of Iran are just like colors, which make a great painting. Iran is home to about 20 ethnic groups who live in different regions of the country.
