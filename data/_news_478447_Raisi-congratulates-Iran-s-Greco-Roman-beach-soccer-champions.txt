TEHRAN- In separate messages on Sunday night, President Ebrahim Raisi congratulated Iran's national Greco-Roman team on their great triumph in the Azerbaijan World Wrestling Championship and the national beach football team on its championship in the UAE Intercontinental Beach Football Championship. In his statement on the occasion, President Raisi said that the victory of the national Iranian wrestling team in the Azerbaijan World Wrestling Championship was both pride-inspiring and a testament to the skills and aptitude of the prestigious Islamic, Iranian youth in sports fields, as well as the efforts made by the coaches, technical team, and all members of the Greco-Roman team, which brought international grandeur for Iran and are sincerely appreciated. “The mighty championship of the national Iran Greco-Roman wrestling team in Azerbaijan World Wrestling Championship was another golden medal added to many gold medals of the proud Iranian wrestling, which I congratulate and wish the team and our nation happiness,” the president added. He asserted that this triumph, which gave him great pride, demonstrated the strength and prowess of the renowned Iranian sportsmen in a variety of sports. Despite the referees' regrettably biased decisions in favor of the hosts, the Iran national Greco-Roman wrestling team defeated the host team, Azerbaijan, in the final of the 2022 Baku Greco-Roman Global Championship on Sunday to claim the top spot in the world rankings. Raisi expressed deep appreciation for the national beach football players, the beloved Iranian people, the team's coaches, and the supporting team in his Sunday night message on the occasion of Iran's beach football team winning the title. In his message to the Iranian national beach football team's victory in the UAE Intercontinental Cup, the president said it "was another display of Iran's power at international sports venues." The president said, “I celebrate this wonderful and pride-inspiring win and praise the coaches, players, and team management who produced this pride, and I pray to Almighty Allah for grandeur of our dear nation, Iran.” Iran's national beach football team defeated the strong Brazil team 2-1 in the final game to clinch Asia-America championship in the 2022 UAE Intercontinental Beach Football.
