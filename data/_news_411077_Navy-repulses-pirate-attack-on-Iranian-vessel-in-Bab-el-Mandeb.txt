TEHRAN – Iran’s naval forces saved one of the country’s trade vessels from a massive pirate attack in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait on Sunday. The Navy’s 44th flotilla of warships, which patrols the Gulf of Aden waters in an overseas mission, saved the trade vessel when Somalian pirates tried to hijack it, Tasnim reported. The pirates, equipped with modern and expensive vessels such as refueling ships, had launched the attack on the Iranian trade vessel on board 11 speed boats. SP/PA
