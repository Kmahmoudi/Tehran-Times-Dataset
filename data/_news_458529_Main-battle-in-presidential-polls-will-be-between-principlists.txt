It seems leading principlist candidates will compete with second rate reformist activists.”  Regarding the speculation of Qalibaf candidacy, the Iranian parliament speaker, he said, “Qalibaf is the right person for management affairs. We need to compare the capabilities of Qalibaf with those who compete in the next election.” On turnout in the presidential election, Hashemi Taba noted, “The country and the political system will lose if Iranians take part in the election at a low rate.” Hashemi Taba ran unsuccessfully in the 2005 and 2017 presidential elections.
