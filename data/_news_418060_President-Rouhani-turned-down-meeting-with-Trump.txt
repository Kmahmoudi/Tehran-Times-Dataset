TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday that President Hassan Rouhani rebuffed a request from the White House to meet U.S. President Donald Trump while in New York for the 72nd UN General Assembly in September. “Such a meeting was suggested by the American side, but was not accepted by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani,” Qassemi said. He also denied reports that French President Emmanuel Macron had been prepared to mediate a meeting between the two leaders. MH/PA
