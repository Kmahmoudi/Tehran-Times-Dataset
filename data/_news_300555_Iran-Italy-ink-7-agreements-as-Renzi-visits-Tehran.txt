TEHRAN - Iran and Italy on Tuesday signed seven cooperation agreements, bringing the two countries closer in cultural, industrial, and economic fields. 
 President Hassan Rouhani and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and other senior officials from the two countries attended the signing ceremony. 
In one of the memoranda of understanding, National Iranian Gas Export Company (NIGC) and Italian Eni agreed to establish their ties. 
Eni is mainly engaged worldwide in exploring, producing, transporting, transforming, and marketing activities associated with oil and gas. 
Other contracts were on automotive industry, tourism, renewable energy, airport construction, railways, and exhibition staging. 
“Italy was Iran’s biggest trade partner in the European Union prior to the sanctions, and today we want the country to perform its previous role,” Rouhani said at a joint press conference with Renzi. 
Also, the Italian prime minister called for close economic interactions between the two countries, stressing that establishing banking links and opening credit lines are key to strong economic and trade flourishing.  
Renzi vowed to call on the G7 countries to completely lift sanctions against Iran, thereby smoothing the path for expansion of economic and cultural bonds.   
Heading a 250-strong political and economic delegation, Renzi arrived at Tehran early on Tuesday, making him the first Italian official in such capacity to visit Iran since 2001. 
Parts of the delegation are Italian ministers of infrastructures and transports, economic development, and agriculture, food and forestry policies. Businessmen and personalities from Italy’s public and private sectors are also accompanying Renzi in the visit. 
Already in January, Iran and Italy concluded 17 deals, worth €17 billion during Rouhani’s visit to the European country.   
Europeans are willing to reestablish trade ties with Tehran, which rejoined the global economy in January following the implementation of the JCPOA, commonly called the nuclear deal.
These days, Tehran has turned into a political hive. Just before the Italian prime minister, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev left Tehran for Astana. 
Also, EU foreign policy chief Mogherini, heading a high-ranking delegation, will be visiting Iran to exchange views with Iranian officials on a wide range of issues. Seven European commissioners will accompany Mogherini.  AK/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
