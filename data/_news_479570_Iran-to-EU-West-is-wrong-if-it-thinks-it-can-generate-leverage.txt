TEHRAN - In a conversation with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Friday that lasted for 70 minutes, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian stressed that the Islamic Republic is firm to “respond to sanctions and interference”. The phone call came from Borrell, who is responsible to coordinate the talks to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the official name for the 2105 nuclear deal. Following the unrest in Iran, which started after the tragic death of Mahsa Amini in September, Western countries, particularly the U.S. and the three European countries of Britain, France and Germany (E3) that are still party to the 2015 nuclear deal, have been pressing Iran under the allegation that the Islamic Republic has cracked down on protestors.  They have slapped new rounds of sanctions against Iran and helped approve two resolutions against the country, one at the IAEA Board of Governors and another at the UN Human Rights Council.  However, Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian said the U.S. and the European trio are “wrong” if they think they can get concessions from Iran through pressure. “Talked to @JosepBorrell following his call. I said, if the US & the E3 think, via pressure, they generate leverage in the negotiations, they are wrong! We respond to sanctions & interference. Concurrently, we are on the way to the final stage of a good, strong & durable agreement.” Amir Abdollahian tweeted. Iran has been saying that it is seeking a lasting and durable nuclear agreement. Iran is insisting on its position as the U.S. quit the JCPOA in May 2018 and returned sanctions lifted under the agreement. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, had earlier emphasized that “American officials know that Iran is not willing to negotiate and make concessions under pressure and threats, the agreement has its own logic, and Iran's position toward the JCPOA negotiations is completely clear.” The hesitancy of the Western parties, mainly the U.S., to make up for the unilateral withdrawal of Washington from the JCPOA has caused the discussions on the renewal of lifting sanctions on Iran to drag on. The sanctions-lifting negotiations have advanced to the point where the final agreement can be reached if the United States accepts Iran's reasonable demands and the prerequisites for the formation of a stable and reliable agreement.  Iran's major requests include the verification of the lifting of sanctions, assurances for the JCPOA's viability, and the cessation of IAEA claims relating to safeguards.
