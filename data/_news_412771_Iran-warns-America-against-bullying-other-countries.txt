TEHRAN – Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan has warned the American leaders against bullying other countries and intervening in their internal affairs, saying “such era has come to an end.” Dehqan’s remarks came amidst growing tension between Tehran and Washington as they increasingly accuse each other of sponsoring terrorism. On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis accused Iran of creating chaos in the region. “Iran has been spreading chaos and havoc in several regional countries, including Yemen. The Houthis and ousted Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh are like puppets controlled by Iran; they do what the Iranians tell them to do,” Mattis claimed Tuesday during his visit to Saudi Arabia. Responding to the his comments, the Iranian defense minister said, “I advise the American defense minister to first study the history of American administrations’ military conflicts in Vietnam, Iraq, Somalia, Afghanistan, and more recently Syria and Yemen.” And then, Dehqan said, they will discover the root cause of their accusations. “Today, Takfiri-Wahhabi terrorists are committing atrocities across the globe, especially in Syria and Iraq, with American weapons and ammunition,” he said. He also criticized the role that the United States plays in supporting Saudi Arabia’s aggression against Yemen. Innocent Yemeni people are fighting against the Saudi-led coalition which has the full support of the Washington, Dehqan said.
