TEHRAN – A torrential rain that struck Tehran Friday afternoon caused damages at the 30th Tehran International Book Fair in the Shahr-e Aftab Fairgrounds. As a result, a large number of publishers were forced to gather up their books at the main halls as their stands were inundated by water that had leaked inside through the ceilings. In addition, a number of the temporary pavilions set up in the courtyard of the fairgrounds suffered heavy losses.       Insurance experts estimated extent of the publishers’ losses. However, they did not disclose the monetary amount. The Tehran International Book Fair resumed its activities on Saturday.
