TEHRAN- The Al-Mayadeen network, quoting some Iranian sources, refuted allegations by the British newspaper Financial Times surrounding Iran in regard to Iraqi Kurdistan. Lately, the Financial Times chimed in to argue that General Ismail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force, had made a threat in his tour to Baghdad that Tehran would launch a ground operation in northern Iraq if separatist terrorists were not prevented from infiltrating Iran. Al-Mayadeen reported that such unfounded claims are totally untrue and General Qaani did not make such statements during his meetings with the Iraqi officials. Sources familiar with the matter underscored that the IRGC Quds Force commander did not threaten any ground strike in northern Iraq.
