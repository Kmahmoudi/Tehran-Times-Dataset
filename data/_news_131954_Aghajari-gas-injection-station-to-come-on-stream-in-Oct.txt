“The project is now 90 percent complete and it is due to become operational in October,” Seifollah Jashnsaz told the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) in Ahvaz, the capital of the southwestern province of Khuzestan. He explained that the station will be used for injecting the gas produced from South Pars phases 6-8 into the Aghajari Oilfield. Two billion cubic feet of natural gas will be conveyed from these phases to the field via a 56-inch pipeline 500 kilometers long, the official added. He went on to say that the Mansurabad, Kabud, and Ab Teimur oilfields and the Khami Paznan, Khami Marun, and Khami Karanj gas fields are all currently being developed in southern Iran. Jashnsaz also stated that the Mansurabad Oilfield would produce 35,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil. NISOC is a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), operating on onshore oil and gas fields in southern Iran. The company’s main office was relocated to Ahvaz last summer, in line with an order by President Mahmud Ahmadinejad to move the main offices of Oil Ministry affiliates to their operation areas.
