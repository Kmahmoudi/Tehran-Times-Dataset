TEHRAN – Attracting $3.372 billion worth of foreign investment in 2016, Iran has registered a 63 percent rise in this regard, IRNA reported on Sunday. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)’s latest report called World Investment Report 2017, Iran has been among successful countries in terms of signing investment agreements in 2016. The report also said Iran’s highest rate of foreign investment attraction goes back to 2012 when the country recorded $4.662 billion of foreign investment. The figure though fell significantly in the next few years due to the sanctions imposed on the country’s economy. In 2015, the total value of foreign investment in the country stood at $2.05 billion, the lowest rate in the last six years. Based on the report, signing a total of 37 international investment agreements (IIA) in 2016, Iran ranked third among the world’s top economies in terms of the number of signed IIAs. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was established in 1964 as a permanent intergovernmental body. UNCTAD is the principal organ of the United Nations General Assembly dealing with trade, investment, and development issues.
