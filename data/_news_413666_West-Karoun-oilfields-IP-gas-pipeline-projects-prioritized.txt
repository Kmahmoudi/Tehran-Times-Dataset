TEHRAN - Iran’s First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri has tasked the Oil Ministry with implementing 11 prioritized projects in the oil and gas sector by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2018). Increasing the output of West Karoun oilfields by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to reach 350,000 bpd, and completing the gas pipeline project with Pakistan are the top priorities, Shana reported on Monday. Moreover, acquiring up-to-date knowledge for upstream projects, including improved oil recovery (IOR) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR), expanding the national gas network in rural areas and adding 900,000 new households to the network, and allocating 3.5 trillion rials (about $93.8 million) for implementing public utility projects in underprivileged regions which enjoy large oil and gas reserves are among the projects.  West Karoun region includes five oilfields Iran shares with Iraq at the western part of Iran’s southwestern region of Karoun. Based on the latest studies, the in-situ deposit of West Karoun oilfields is estimated to be 67 billion barrels containing both light and crude oils. The Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project was launched in 2010, aiming to construct 1,800 kilometers of pipeline from Iran to Pakistan. Iran plans to deliver 21.5 million cubic meters per day of gas to Pakistan through the project.  While Iran has completed its part of the gas pipeline, Pakistan has fallen behind the target to take delivery of gas, initially scheduled for 2014.
