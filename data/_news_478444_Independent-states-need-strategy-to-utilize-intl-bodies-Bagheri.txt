TEHRAN- Accentuating how America unfairly uses international organizations against independent nations, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Ali Bagheri Kani has stated that such nations also require strategy to utilize the capabilities of such organizations. Bagheri Kani held separate meetings on Sunday with the deputy foreign ministers of Russia, Venezuela, and Cuba who visited Tehran for participation in the 1st Meeting of Coordinators of National Group of Friends to Support the UN Charter. In his meeting with Bagheri Kani, Sergey Vreshnin, the deputy foreign minister of Russia, lambasted U.S. policies for using human rights as political leverage.  He also stressed the need for cooperation between Tehran and Moscow in fending off Western political and economic pressure. In separate meetings with Bagheri Kani, Venezuelan Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Julio Martinez and Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Elio Rodrguez Perdomo, while emphasizing the need for increased economic cooperation and resistance to the U.S. totalitarian approach in various fields, said that safeguarding the interests of independent countries is a dire necessity. Combining the political, economic, legal, and media capabilities of the independent countries against the totalitarian approach of the Americans and their Western allies will lessen the pressure that is applied, the Iranian deputy foreign minister stated in those meetings, referring to the various and numerous capacities in any of the member countries of the Coordinators of National Group of Friends to Support UN Charter. According to Bagheri Kani, the U.S. unfairly uses international institutions and foundations against sovereign nations in order to further its own illegal goals.
