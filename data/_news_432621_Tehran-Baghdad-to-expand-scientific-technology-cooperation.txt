TEHRAN – Iraq’s Higher Education Minister Qusay Abdul Wahab al-Suhail and the Iranian vice president for science and technology Sourena Sattari discussed ways to boost cooperation in the field of science and technology during a meeting on Sunday, Mehr reported. The two sides also discussed cooperation in the field of nanotechnology, medical sciences and stem cells. The Iranian young generation of entrepreneurs can establish cooperation with other countries, Sattari said. Iranian young entrepreneurs pave the way for development of their country and create added value by their actives, he said. Startups provide high quality services and products in international level and have a great capacity for cooperation with other countries, he said. However, an appropriate infrastructure should be provided by the government for cooperation between countries, he added. Sattari also pointed to knowledge-based companies which are connecting universities to industries.
