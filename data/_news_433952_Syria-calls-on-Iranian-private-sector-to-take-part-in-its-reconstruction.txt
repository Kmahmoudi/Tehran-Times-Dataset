TEHRAN – Syria has called on Iranian private sector to have a greater part in reconstruction of the war-damaged country, IRNA reported. A trade delegation from Syria visited Iran this week and attended a meeting which was held at Iran Chamber of Cooperatives in Tehran on Monday. In the meeting the Syrian side expressed their appreciation for Iran’s significant role in helping the Arab nation in various areas and called on Iranian private companies to cooperate with their Syrian counterparts in order to accelerate the reconstruction process. According to the officials, Syria is going to need billions of dollars of investment for reconstruction. The two sides further emphasized the need for using the local currencies in trade in order to facilitate the transactions between the two countries. Many urban areas across Syria, particularly around Damascus, have been hard-hit by war, and President Bashar Assad said this month that rebuilding would be his “top priority”. Iran and Syria have been exchanging numerous trade delegations in the past few months and Iranian private companies are already investing in different areas like providing construction materials especially cement and working on several reconstruction projects in Syria. In August 2018, a delegation comprised of Iranian economic experts traveled to Syria to explore investment opportunities and finalize the reconstruction plans of the war-stricken country. Also in January, the 14th preparatory meeting of Iran-Syria high joint technical committee of economic cooperation was held at Damascus. The event was attended by the Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Amir Amini and Deputy Head of the Planning and International Cooperation Authority of Syria Thoraya Idlbi. Amini had also said that Iranian private sector has started cooperation with Syria in order to rebuild the country’s war-damaged infrastructures. According to the official, Iranian investors and enterprises are eager to play a key role in Syria’s potential $600-billion worth of projects.
