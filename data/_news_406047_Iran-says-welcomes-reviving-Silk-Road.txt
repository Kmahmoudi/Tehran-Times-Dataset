TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Velayati, the senior foreign policy advisor to the Leader, said on Saturday that Iran welcomes cooperation with China to revive the Silk Road.
 “Some countries may not agree on reviving the Silk Road, however Iran has no problem in this respect,” Velayati told a forum of Silk Road mayors held in the city of Qazvin, northwest of Tehran. He also said that Iran is interested in expanding economic and political relations with China. Velayati, a former foreign minister who is the current president of the Expediency Council Center for Strategic Research, said Tehran is seeking “strategic ties” with China. Velayati said that Iran and China are adopting “closer” position in their foreign policies, citing the two countries’ stances on Syria as an example. Velayati said that Iran as the “safest” country in the Middle East links East Asia with Europe and Africa. “Security is an important issue and a prerequisite for investment in reviving the Silk Road and Iran has no problem in this regard,” he explained. He expressed hope that the Silk Road summit would bring many achievements. The 11th international summit of the Silk Road started in Qazvin on Saturday and will end on Sunday.
