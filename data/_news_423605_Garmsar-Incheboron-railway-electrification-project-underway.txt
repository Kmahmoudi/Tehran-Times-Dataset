TEHRAN- The project for electrification of Garmsar–Incheboron railway to the length of 495 kilometers, linking Garmsar in the north-central province of Semnan to Incheboron in the northeastern province of Golestan, is being implemented. The project will be financed by Russia and will be operated through cooperation of Russian and Iranian companies. It includes supplying fleet and repairing and upgrading entire infrastructures such as tracks, stations, and signaling systems along the route. Preliminary and contractual measures have been completed over the past couple of years and the project is now in the phase of construction, the public relations department of the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (known as RAI) announced on Tuesday. Maziyar Yazdani, the deputy head of RAI for infrastructure and technical affairs, said: “The route contains Garmsar to Incheboron, branch line of Gorgan to Sabz Dasht and branch line of Rostam Kola to Amir Abad, that all of them are single track lines. Major part of this route is in the oldest line of Iran railways network.” This route’s severe gradient and being single track have made it a bottleneck for north to south corridor of Iran railways, he noted. As this route throws out mountains and due to its difficult accessibility, for increasing carrying capacity of line, technical studies resulted in the option of electrification, the official explained.
