TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani on Monday hailed the successful launch of the Qaem-100 satellite-carrying rocket by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force, saying it has made the foes “angry and delirious”. Nasser Kan'ani made the remark just two days after the launch of the three-stage solid fuel suborbital carrier. Qaem-100, the first of its kind manufactured by Iranian scientists, is capable of putting satellites weighing up to 80 kilograms into orbit 500 kilometers from the earth's surface. The spokesman called launch a symbol of “national power”. “The successful launch of the Qaem-100 satellite carrier was another demonstration of the national power and the ability of Iran’s young scientists for surmounting the summits of science and modern technologies,” Kanaani tweeted, Press TV reported. The point that makes the launch even more important is that it took place despite the enemies’ sanctions, including the United States’ so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran, Kanaani remarked. “This is the very thing that has made the Iranian nation’s known enemies angry and delirious.” According to IRGC officials, Qaem-100 is now ready to launch Nahid, a satellite manufactured by the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, into orbit in the near future. Speaking on the sidelines of the Saturday ceremony, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC Aerospace Division, said arrogant countries, led by the United States, are doing all they can to hinder Iran's progress. "They cannot stand the impressive achievements of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Hajizadeh pointed out. Previous launches have drawn criticism from the United States and its allies, which have long been wary of Iran’s satellite program as the same technology can be used to develop long-range missiles. Iran says its satellite program is aimed at scientific research and other civilian applications. The United States claimed the launch was “unhelpful and destabilizing”. “The United States remains concerned with Iran’s continued development of space launch vehicles (SLVs), which pose a significant proliferation concern,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said, according to euro news. The spokesperson added, “SLVs incorporate technologies that are virtually identical to, and interchangeable with, those used in ballistic missiles, including longer-range systems.” Iran has over the past years succeeded in manufacturing and putting into space different satellites as well as launching various carriers. Late in June, Iran tested its domestically-developed hybrid-propellant satellite carrier rocket called Zuljanah for “predetermined research purposes” for the second time. Also, a new air defense missile powered by solid propellants was unveiled by the Defense Ministry on Sunday. The missile, called “Sayyad 4B”, is paired with Bavar-373 air defense system. It has a range of 300 kilometers. In a recent test, the Bavar-373 air defense system successfully hit a target at a distance of over 300 km with the new missile. The Iranian air defense system managed to detect the target at a range of more than 450 kilometers with its optimized radar and tracked the target at a distance of around 405 km before detonating it with Sayyad 4B, Tasnim reported. The missile’s engine runs on hybrid solid fuel and has undergone an operational test for the first time. The new breakthrough has increased the range of the detection radar of Bavar 373 from 350 to 450 km, while its tracking radar’s range has risen from 260 to 400 kilometers. The employment of the new missile also means that the range of the Iranian air defense system missiles has been extended to 300 km and the altitude of engagement has increased from 27 to 32 km. Army’s Air Defense Force Commander Sabahi Fard said on Sunday that Bavar-373 has the capability to counter drones and all fighter jets, including “generation 5” warplanes. Sabahi Fard also said Iran is among the few countries in the world which has succeeded to build such a powerful air defense system. The top military official added Bavar-373 and other air defense systems will be upgraded superior to the threats. Defense Minister Mohammadreza Ashtiani also called Bavar-373 a great defense and national achievement and said, “This system will have a very important role in upgrading military power of armed forces.”    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
