TEHRAN — NGOs should talk to people directly and inform them of their natural and legal citizenship rights, said Elham Aminzadeh, the advisor to President Hassan Rouhani on citizenship rights. She made the remarks during a meeting with executive directors of a number of Tehran-based NGOs here on Monday. The session was coordinated following President Rouhani’s order to draft a citizenship right charter. The charter is yet to be approved. Over the course of the meeting, Aminzadeh who was formerly the vice president for legal affairs, explained how NGOs which are non-governmental groups set up and run by the citizens themselves rather than the government can help make people aware of their rights as citizens. She further regretted the fact that sometimes in some cases the NGOs are perceived as a threat to the national security and that such an attitude towards the public led non-governmental organizations which are merely after social changes for the better must be changed.   “What we are seeking most is to adopt an administrative law at the parliament which can govern the NGOs and recognize them as independent public bodies to empower them,” she highlighted. The meeting culminated with the NGOs directors defining their key requirements and major obstacle they normally come across while pursuing and pushing for a social reform.
