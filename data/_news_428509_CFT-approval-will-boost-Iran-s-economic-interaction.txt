TEHRAN – The Iranian parliament on October 7 ratified a global convention to cut off terror financing, a move that Reza Kami, chairman of the Iran-Turkey Joint Chamber of Commerce, says will improve Iran’s international image and facilitate Iran’s economic interaction with the outside world.
 A total of 143 lawmakers, out of 268 ones present in the 290-seat parliament voted to join "Combating the Financing of Terrorism," or CFT. To become a law, however, the oversight Guardian Council should vet the bill for compliance with the Constitution.   “Turkey is a member to this convention and it will facilitate our banking and financial relations,” he Kami said in an interview with ILNA published on Saturday. He noted that transparency in financial interaction will encourage businessmen and investors.
