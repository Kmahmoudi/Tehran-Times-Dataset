TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has slammed U.S. hypocrisy in dealing with Saudi Arabia’s human rights and nuclear program, saying neither human rights nor a nuclear program have been the real concern of the U.S. “Day by day it becomes clearer to the world what was always clear to us: neither human rights nor a nuclear program have been the real concern of the U.S. First a dismembered journalist; now illicit sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia fully expose #USHypocrisy,” Zarif tweeted on Wednesday. According to a new report, the Trump administration sought to rush the transfer of American nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in potential violation of the law.
