TEHRAN – More than 140 people were killed and more than 525 wounded when airstrikes hit a funeral ceremony in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, a senior UN official has said. According to the Guardian, The dead and wounded include senior military and security officials from the ranks of the Shia Houthi rebels fighting President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi .
In the aftermath of the strike on Saturday, hundreds of body parts were found strewn in and outside the hall. Rescuers collected them in sacks. “The place has been turned into a lake of blood,” said one rescuer, Murad Tawfiq.
Ambulances rushed to the site to ferry the wounded to hospitals. In radio broadcasts, the health ministry summoned off-duty doctors and called on residents to donate blood. Rescuers, meanwhile, sifted through the rubble in search of more casualties but a fire hindered their efforts.
The funeral was for Ali al-Rawishan, the father of the interior minister Galal al-Rawishan, an ally of both the Houthi movement and their chief ally, Saleh.
Witnesses and medics said a missile hit the hall in the south of the capital, destroying the building. They described ambulances ferrying casualties from the scene, where a plume of black smoke rose into the sky.
The Houthi-controlled news site sabanews.net said: “Dozens of citizens fell as martyrs or were wounded in this attack by planes of the Saudi-American aggression.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
