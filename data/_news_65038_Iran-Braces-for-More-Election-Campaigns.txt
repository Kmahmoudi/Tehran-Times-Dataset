All the presidential hopefuls have been appearing on TV and installing posters and placards in the streets with the hope of getting as many people as possible to vote for them at the polls. Groups and parties as well as the candidates themselves have been calling on mass participation of the nation in the elections which determines the future of the "reforms", which President Mohammad Khatami had made the cornerstone of his first term in office. In an opinion poll conducted by the TEHRAN TIMES, more than 80% of Tehran citizens have said they will participate in the elections although many of interviewees said they have not yet made up their mind which candidate they would vote for. In order to give a wide spectrum on all the candidates, TEHRAN TIMES has already carried parts of televised interviews of six candidates and will today cover the interviews of the remaining four. ---------- Kashani Criticizes Iranian Presidents ----------- Seyed Mahmoud Kashani, in his interview with the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) criticized former Iranian presidents and said they had not properly used their capacity as president in accordance with the power the Constitution has provided for them. Referring to the youth issue on his platform, Kashani said the youth should be respected and their legitimate demands should be heeded. He called for a judicial system for the youth different from that of adults as specified by a 1989 protocol to which Iran is a signatory. He called for guaranteeing security of investment, creation of jobs, government's non-intervention in economy and industry, abandoning traditional policies concerning productive jobs, preserving a line of action free from extremes, free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections, creation of various decision-making centers and classification of cities. He said a president should make optimum use of the tools available and employ the competent individuals in his future cabinet. Born in Tehran in 1942, Kashani holds a Ph.D. in law and the highest degree in jurisprudence. ---------- Sadr to Push for Educational Reforms -------- Seyed Shahaboddin Sadr said that should he be elected president he would use his authority as stipulated in the Constitution to improve the country's educational system. Sadr also urged easing of people's problems such as unemployment, further attention to research, strong link between the academic centers and society through government support, manpower development, attraction of the elite and talented individuals, more attention to the youth through suitable planning, improvement of the political, economic and cultural reforms and prioritizing agriculture in a national development plan. Born in Tehran in 1962, Sadr is a medical doctor and physiologist from Tehran University. ------- Hashemi-Taba Wants No More Authority Than Stipulated in Current Constitution ------ Presidential advisor, Mostafa Hashemi-Taba said that if elected president he would abide by the Constitution. Hashemi-Taba told IRIB that he did not want any more authority than what is already envisaged in the Constitution. He said people should not expect more than that. Touching on the president's responsibilities clarified by the Constitution, he said that naturally, in matters related to the armed forces, Judiciary and leadership as envisioned in the Constitution, the president has no authority. He said the president has such responsibilities as safeguarding the Islamic Republic and the Constitution, handling state affairs in the best possible manner, uplifting the status of the country, promoting religion and ethics, supporting justice, preventing selfishness, supporting freedom and people's dignity and rights, protecting borders and the country's political, economic and cultural independence. --------- Ghafoorifard Familiar With People's Demands ------ Another candidate Hassan Ghafoorifard said he is familiar with the people's needs and requirements and his reason for taking part in the elections is his familiarity with people's demands. Like his rival Hashemi-Taba, Ghafoorifard said he believes the Constitution has given enough authority to the president. He pointed to poverty, discrimination, corruption and unemployment as main problems the country is facing now. Expressing views on "reforms", the former MP said the word should be defined first and then any implementation attempted. Referring to remarks of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ghafoorifard said the greatest reforms are campaigning against poverty and corruption. He also said he was concerned for the earnings of the people and their living situation.

Hashemi-Taba told IRIB that he did not want any more authority than what is already envisaged in the Constitution. He said people should not expect more than that. Touching on the president's responsibilities clarified by the Constitution, he said that naturally, in matters related to the armed forces, Judiciary and leadership as envisioned in the Constitution, the president has no authority. He said the president has such responsibilities as safeguarding the Islamic Republic and the Constitution, handling state affairs in the best possible manner, uplifting the status of the country, promoting religion and ethics, supporting justice, preventing selfishness, supporting freedom and people's dignity and rights, protecting borders and the country's political, economic and cultural independence. --------- Ghafoorifard Familiar With People's Demands ------ Another candidate Hassan Ghafoorifard said he is familiar with the people's needs and requirements and his reason for taking part in the elections is his familiarity with people's demands.
