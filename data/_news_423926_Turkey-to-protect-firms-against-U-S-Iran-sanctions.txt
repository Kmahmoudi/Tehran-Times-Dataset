TEHRAN – Ankara will take steps to protect Turkish companies which may suffer as a result of new U.S. sanctions against Iran, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said on Friday. Aksoy, however, did not disclose any specific plans to protect companies from U.S. sanctions, Trend reported. Turkey has criticized the anti-Iran sanctions by the U.S. government, with President Erdogan saying the new sanctions will not have any effect. He added, “The U.S. refusal to stick to the nuclear deal shows that Washington was not sincere in relation to the nuclear agreement with Iran.”  MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
