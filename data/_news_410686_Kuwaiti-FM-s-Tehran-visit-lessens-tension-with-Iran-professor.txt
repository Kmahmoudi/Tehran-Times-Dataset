TEHRAN – Nader Entessar, an Alabama University political science professor, has said Kuwaiti foreign minister’s recent trip to Iran “may signify a less confrontational approach to Iran by some members of the GCC.”

 Speaking to Mehr in an interview published on Wednesday, Entessar said Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Hamad al-Sabah “very likely carried messages from other regional leaders and conveyed them to Foreign Minister Zarif and President Rouhani. But the symbolic value of this trip was important.” SP/PA
