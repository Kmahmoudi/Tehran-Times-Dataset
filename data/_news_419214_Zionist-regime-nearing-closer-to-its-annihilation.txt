TEHRAN – By naming al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel, the United States has made the Zionist regime closer to its annihilation, a lawmaker said on Sunday.  Hossein Naqavi Hosseini, spokesman of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Majlis, said the decision came after Washington failed in its Middle-East policies and wanted to compensate for its shortcomings, ISNA reported. “America and the Zionists should know that al-Quds will remain Islamic and the Muslim world will be united against Americans’ aggressive measure,” he added.
