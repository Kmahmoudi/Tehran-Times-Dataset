TEHRAN – The Islamic Republic of Iran Railways will add a fresh tourism rail line, linking the historical cities of Tabriz and Maragheh in the northwestern province of East Azarbaijan.  “This train is being run by the private sector in order to develop the tourism industry of the province and it will make its debut on May 11, departing Tabriz for Maragheh,” Shapour Aslani, the provincial railway chief, told IRNA on Tuesday.    Just east of Lake Urmia lies the historic city of Maragheh, which was briefly the capital of Ilkhanid dynasty (1256–1353). It’s famous for five distinctive 12th-century tomb towers, and for the ruins of the world’s greatest medieval observatory. Tabriz bears the title of the capital of Islamic tourism in 2018. It hosts variety of historical sites such as Jameh Mosque of Tabriz and Arg of Tabriz, and UNESCO-registered Tabriz Historic Bazaar Complex to name a few.
