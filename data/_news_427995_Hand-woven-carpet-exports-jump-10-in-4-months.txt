TEHRAN – Iran’s export of hand-woven carpets increased 10 percent in terms of value during the first four months of the current Iranian calendar year 1397 (March 21-July 22, 2018), from a year earlier, ISNA reported on Saturday. “According to the customs statistics, exports of Iranian handmade carpets has increased by 10% over the [year’s first] four months,” said Abdollah Bahrami, the head of the National Union of Cooperatives of Iran’s Carpet Manufacturers. He didn’t mention the value of exports but noted, “Last year, our exports were about $400 million, up 20% from the preceding year, and on average, from [the Iranian year] 1395 onward, we had 15 to 20% growth each year.” Persian carpets are sought after internationally for their delicate designs and their good quality. The country’s official figures show the carpets have a significant share in Iran’s non-oil exports.  AFM/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
