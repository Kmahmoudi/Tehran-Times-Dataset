TEHRAN – Head of the Presidential Office has said the JCPOA is not only a commitment which the bargaining sides have to meet, but also it is an “international document.” Iran and six global powers of the U.S., China, Russia, England, France, and Germany clinched a deal on Tehran’s nuclear program, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, last July in Vienna. 
The deal went into effect on January 16th, called the Implementation Day.  “The JCPOA now is not only a commitment between Iran and six countries but also it is an international document,” Mohammad Nahavandian told ISNA in an interview published on Friday.  The comments by Nahavandian are a reply to opponents of the deal inside Iran as well as those in the U.S. who keep lambasting the Obama administration for signing the pact. 
“The same people who created hurdles for the ratification of the deal continue to do so now,” Nahavandian lamented. 
Inside Iran, those ill-disposed toward the agreement have unleashed a barrage of sarcastic attacks on the Rouhani administration as the presidential election, slated for May 19, is approaching. 
Tehran would expect economic gains following the deal. Opponents say the deal ironically has resulted in almost “nothing,” citing Washington getting in the way of Iran’s re-engagement with the global economic mainstream.  Driven by the “almost nothing” mindset, the opponents have been lobbying for reconstituting nuclear capabilities rolled back under the nuclear deal. 
The situation in the U.S. is no better.  While Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has backed the deal, her Republican wayward rival Donald Trump has been threatening to “rip up” the JCPOA.  
Although opponents of the deal inside both countries have always been each other’s archenemies, both agree on one thing: the countries would have been better off without the deal. 
Both camps, however, have failed to provide cogent reasons for their disagreement.  AK/PA
