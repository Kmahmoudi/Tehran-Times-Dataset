TEHRAN- Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the speaker of Iran's Parliament, has emphasized that all Iranians, even critics and protesters, love the Islamic nation and would never support warmongers or terrorists. Speaking in an open session of the Parliament on Wednesday, Ghalibaf said that Iranians will press their demands while expressing resentment toward the Americans who had planned a coup after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  As a result, the authorities in the Islamic country must create a conducive environment for hearing their demands and implementing them, he added. The remarks by the top lawmaker came two days before Iran commemorate National Day of Fight against Global Arrogance and U.S. Embassy Takeover (Den of Espionage) as well as Students’ Day.  The speaker asserted that the U.S., as the symbol of global arrogance, has tried to harm other countries by using various tactics like coups, civil wars, arming extremist groups, occupation, and planned revolutions. He added that the Iranians reached the point where the highest official of their nation should not be a pawn of the U.S., so the will of no imperialist should be able to disintegrate a part of the country.  The Iranian nation decided to stand against the global arrogance four decades ago and seized the den of spies in order to impose its own will on the U.S. as a hegemon. As a result, on November 4, 1979, the Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy to demonstrate that the period of coups had come to an end, he stated. The speaker argued that although the U.S., its spy network, and their saboteurs projected a sophisticated plan in the recent incidents in the country, they erred once more.  The U.S. knows that people around the world are on the verge of acquiring the same historical knowledge against global arrogance, so they made great efforts to spread the myth that there is some sort of impasse in Islamic Iran, the speaker remarked. “As I've already stressed, the fundamental strategy for opposing the U.S. is to demand that the Iranian government serve the needs of the Iranian people in order to lessen national issues.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
