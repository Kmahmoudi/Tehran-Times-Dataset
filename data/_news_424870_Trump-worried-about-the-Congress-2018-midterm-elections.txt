Public opposition to the policies of Donald Trump, the controversial president of the United States, is still on the rise. Polls conducted in the United States indicate that many of the American citizens who voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections, are now regretting their choice. The latest CNN poll shows that only 9 percent of Americans opposed to President Donald Trump are content with his policies towards Iran. The results of the poll suggest that most of those Americans who are generally dissatisfied with Trump’s policies, are almost dissatisfied with his decisions on various issues. Such dissatisfaction can be seen both in domestic politics and in the U.S. foreign policy. Even Trump’s protectionist policies have not been able to win the satisfaction of American voters. According to the CNN recent poll, only 12% of Trump’s opponents have confirmed his policies in foreign trade, and only 10% confirmed his approach towards the Congress’ Republican representatives. This is while only 8% thoroughly agreed with his performance in international affairs. This poll, along with dozens of other polls, highlights the weakness of the U.S. President during the Congress 2918 midterm elections, as well as the 2020 presidential elections. One of the main concerns of Trump and his government is about results of the midterm elections this year. Polls conducted in the United States show that Democrats aren’t going to have a hard time to win this election, and in capturing the majority seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate. In that case, the gap between the traditional Republicans and Trump will also intensify, and many Republicans prefer to lobby against the President of the United States in order to secure their victory in 2020 and thereafter. This process could result in the impeachment of Trump in the next American Congress. The U.S. President has recently stated his worries over his impeachment in case Democrats could win the Congress seats. Polls results suggest that more Americans support impeaching President Donald Trump than oppose it. The poll, conducted by Democratic polling company Public Policy Polling, found that 48 per cent supported such a move, while 41 per cent opposed it. In any case, Trump's controversial policies and actions such as his withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran and moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem have imposed hefty costs on U.S. domestic and foreign policy. This same issue has led to more anger and dissatisfaction with Trump in the United States. Obviously, under such circumstances, Trump can’t rely on his "9 percent" army to support his extremist policies towards Iran! It should not be forgotten that, in the 2016 presidential election, Trump didn’t really succeed in defeating his rival Hillary Clinton, and she has won the popular vote by more than 2.86 million ballots. However, Trump moved to the White House based on the Electoral College (which is an example of an objective violation of democracy in the United States). Trump has now received news on his declining popularity with American citizens in important and determining states. Under such conditions, most American analysts don’t predict a good, stable political future for their controversial president!   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
