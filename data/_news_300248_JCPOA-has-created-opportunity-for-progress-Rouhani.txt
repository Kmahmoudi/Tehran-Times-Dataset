TEHRAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly called the nuclear deal, has created an atmosphere to tap all the capacities in line with the efforts to develop the country.  A “wise and fast” move towards development and progress is required, Rouhani said during a meeting with the information and communications technology minister and the other high-ranking officials of the ministry. He said that the atmosphere of hope that has been created after the JCPOA should not be spoiled. Rouhani also highlighted the importance of maintaining unity in the country. He also said that Iran is an “influential and capable” country in the global energy market. Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany – reached the JCPOA in Vienna on July 14, 2015. The JCPOA went into effect in January 2016.   NA/PA         All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
