The daily said that Iran has been making efforts to increase its share of the world tourism market and that such efforts are evident in Iran's increasing participation in international conventions and exhibitions on tourism. "Iranian officials and managers of international tourism exhibitions receive a great number of applications from travel agencies and businesses interested in signing contracts to send individuals or groups of travelers to Iran," the daily reported. The editor of Al-Akhbar said, "There has been a significant increase in the number of tourists from Persian Gulf countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. This is the first time that Arab tourists have outnumbered other international tourists in Iran. The main reasons have been the mild weather, the historical sites and the feeling of comfort and relaxation that exists in Iran." Many experts believe that after the events of September 11, because of the problems in obtaining visas to visit Western countries, Iran has become a new favorite destination for international travelers. Iran welcomes 1.5 million tourists every year. Most of these travelers go to religious cities like Mashhad or historical sites such as Isfahan, Rasht, and Persepolis. Iran's revenues from tourism amount to U.S.$1 billion per year.
