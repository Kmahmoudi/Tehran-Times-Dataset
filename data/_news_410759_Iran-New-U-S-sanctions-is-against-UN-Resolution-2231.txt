TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday saying the U.S. move in imposing sanctions on 25 individuals and companies is illegitimate and contrary to the UN Security Council Resolution 2231.
 The resolution 2231 was adopted on July 20, 215, endorsing the nuclear deal - officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - between Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany, and the European Union. Under the nuclear agreement Iran slowed down its nuclear agreement for a termination of the sanctions. On Friday President Donald Trump’s administration imposed new sanctions on 25 individuals and companies connected to Iran’s missile program. Following is an excerpt of the statement by the Foreign Ministry: The Foreign Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran considers the U.S. government’s illegal action in adding new Iranian and non-Iranian individuals and institutions to the list of illegitimate sanctions under the pretext of recent missile test by Iran is contrary to the U.S. commitments and the spirit of the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. The Development of missile capability is the right of the Iranian people based on international law and the UN Charter. The Islamic Republic of Iran will take retaliatory and proper action if its people’s interests are targeted. Iran will take action in exerting legal restriction on a number of the U.S. individuals and companies that help terrorists in the region. Security of Iran is non-negotiable and the U.S. inconsiderate action will not stop Iran from following its principled policy in maintaining regional peace and stability and fighting terrorism and extremism.
