TEHRAN- The French charg√© d'affaires to Tehran has been called by the Iranian Foreign Ministry in protest to France's interference in domestic Iranian matters and of France's position on protests in Iran.
 According to Iran's Foreign Ministry, the diplomat was called on Wednesday as a result of a meddling statement by the French Foreign Ministry, participation of three French government advisors in rallies in Paris against Iran, and the ludicrous behavior of the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in the absence of ambassador to Tehran, and he was informed that the Islamic Republic vehemently opposes and condemns their intervention in Iranian internal matters through the use of "false interpretations." The French Foreign Ministry's statement was intended to defend rioters who had no other intention but to incite damage and endanger the lives and property of Iranian citizens, the charge d'affaires was informed. The head of Iran's Second Bureau of West Europe at the Foreign Ministry told the French diplomat that "the French authorities are playing a double game because on the one hand, they host groups that have been directly involved in the recent unrest in Iran over the years, and on the other hand, they criticize the Iranian police forces for confronting such rioters." It seems that the French government has forgotten how harshly the police responded to the Yellow Vest demonstrators who disrupted national security and defied law and order. The Iranian diplomat said "under no circumstances will the Islamic Republic tolerate any interference in its internal affairs. Iran will consider a proportionate and timely measure by carefully monitoring the stances and movements of foreigners" in response to a part of the French Foreign Ministry's statement in which it says that France, the European Union, and other allies would consider all options to deal with the recent developments in Iran. The Islamic Republic has already summoned the ambassadors of Sweden, Norway, and the United Kingdom to express its displeasure with the respective governments' attitudes on the unrest in Iran and their reluctance to defend Iranian embassies. Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian lady, died on September 16 at a hospital after falling inside a police station in Tehran, where she and a group of others were receiving instruction on dress code laws. Amini's death sparked protests in a number of Iranian towns. Despite the government's clarification surrounding her death, the protests quickly became violent as protesters attacked ambulances, police, and Islamic holy sites, among other targets. Ebrahim Raisi, the President of Iran, has stated that those who have harmed the nation's security and tranquility will be dealt with "decisively".
