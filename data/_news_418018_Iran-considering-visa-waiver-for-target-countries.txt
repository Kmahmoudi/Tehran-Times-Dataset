TEHRAN – Iran tourism chief has said that the country is considering to grant visa-free entry to nationals of several ‘target’ countries. “A visa waiver scheme will ease foreign tourist arrivals, albeit the current procedure is reasonable as visas on arrival are being issued for citizens of 180 countries at several airports across the country,” Ali-Asghar Mounesan said, without giving further details.    “We are closely pursuing the objective with the [participation of] Foreign Ministry”, CHTN quoted Mounesan as saying on Thursday. In 2016, over 5.5 million foreign travelers from the Middle East, the Americas, Europe, South and East Asia set foot in Iran, fetching close to $8b in revenues. Filled from corner to corner with ancient bazaars, museums, mosques, monuments, gardens, historical sites, rich natural and rural landscapes, the country is increasingly filled with camera-wielding Westerners who are seeking adventure, archeology and art. Iran hosts some of the world’s oldest cultural monuments, including 22 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Its varied terrain ranges from desert locales to ski resorts.
