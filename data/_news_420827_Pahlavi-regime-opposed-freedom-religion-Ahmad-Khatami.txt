TEHRAN – A senior cleric says the Pahlavi dynasty, which ruled Iran from 1925 to 1979, opposed freedom and religion, calling for raising public awareness about corruption in the Pahlavi regime as the ceremonies marking the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution is nearing. “The looter Pahlavi regime was not only anti-religion, but also anti-freedom,” Ahmad Khatami was quoted by Tasnim as saying. “It fought and opposed freedom and the basic rights of the Iranian nation.” He added that during the Pahlavi rule, no free elections based on people’s choice were held as the regime did not believe in people’s role in politics.
