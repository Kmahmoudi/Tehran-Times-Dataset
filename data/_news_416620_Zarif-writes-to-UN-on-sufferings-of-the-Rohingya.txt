TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sent a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday urging swift action to end the agonies of the Rohingya Muslim community in Myanmar.
 According VICE News, over a quarter of a million refugees from Myanmar’s Muslim Rohingya group have poured over the border into teeming camps and makeshift shelters in Bangladesh over the past two weeks. They’re fleeing a brutal campaign of executions, sexual violence and village-burning allegedly being waged by government forces. “It is expected that the United Nations act swiftly and undertake all necessary measures towards addressing international concerns about the deteriorating situation in Myanmar,” Zarif said in the letter published on the Iranian Foreign Ministry website. Following is full text of the letter: Pursuant to my letter dated 6 January 2017, I would like to once again draw your attention to the alarming situation of the Rohingya Muslim community in Myanmar. The recent horrifying news coming out of the region reveals the scope of the atrocities committed against this community. The indiscriminate systematic attacks against Muslims by extremist elements and some associated with the security forces have resulted in significant loss of life and exacerbated a history of discrimination, injustice and desperation. The gravity of the situation has caused serious anguish among the peoples of the world regardless of their faith and nationality. Should the systematic and extensive violation of the basic human rights of the Rohingya Muslims be left unattended, it would encourage extremism and instigate violence even beyond the borders of Myanmar and become a destabilizing factor for the whole region.
Should the systematic and extensive violation of the basic human rights of the Rohingya Muslims be left unattended, it would encourage extremism and instigate violence even beyond the borders of Myanmar and become a destabilizing factor for the whole region. Forcing people out of their homeland and displacing them in other countries will not resolve this deep-rooted crisis. The Government of Myanmar needs to address the long-standing grievances and the plight of its Muslim community including through effective restoration of their right to be recognized as equal citizens and enjoy protection against violence and discrimination. The international community and Islamic countries expect the government of Myanmar to put an immediate end to the ongoing violence against Rohingya Muslim community, allow unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to the violence-stricken regions, bring those responsible for the atrocities to justice and put in place necessary measures to prevent their recurrence in the future. It is disappointing that such minimum global demands are yet to receive a proper response. Meanwhile, it is also expected that the United Nations act swiftly and undertake all necessary measures towards addressing international concerns about the deteriorating situation in Myanmar. The United Nations’ support for de-escalating violence, ensuring humanitarian assistance for the people in need and finding a sustainable solution for the crisis is essential and urgently needed. The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready and willing to support all such efforts towards the achievement of a durable and peaceful solution to the crisis, ensuring full respect for the human rights, wellbeing and security of the Rohingya Muslim Community in Myanmar. Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.
