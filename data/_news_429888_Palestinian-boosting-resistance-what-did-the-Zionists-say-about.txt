The defeat of Israeli forces by the Islamic resistance group in the Gaza strip has recorded a new setback in the Zionist blackmail report on the war on Gaza. The Zionist regime thinking to break up the Islamic resistance groups in the early hours the military invasion in Gaza was unrealized. It was well understood that the battle equations in this stratum had completely changed and that the situation was no longer the way the Tel Aviv authorities imagined.  Resistance groups in Palestine have proved it to the world that Zionists are much smaller than they can assassinate and eliminate senior members and elites of the resistance. The failure of the Zionist enemy to assassinate leaders of the Palestinian Islamic resistance groups brought a devastating blow to Tel Aviv, and the regime's authorities realized that the defense capability of the resistance was a reality they had failed to realize. Zionist War Minister Avigdor Lieberman has been calling for assassinations of leaders of Islamic resistance movements in the occupied territories of Palestine and especially in the Gaza Strip over the past three years. He also recently announced that the Palestinian initiative to send arson balloons to Tel Aviv's positions should take the policy of terror. Meanwhile, Israeli economy minister Eli Cohen has also called for assassinations of leaders of Islamic Resistance groups in Palestine. He argued that the use of the policy of assassination against resistance leaders would instigate terror among the Palestinians. Education Minister Naftali Bennett has also sponsored a policy of assassination, saying that the leaders of Hamas must be assassinated and their missile infrastructure completely destroyed. A long time ago, the Israel Security Agency (Shabak) issued a new list of commanders of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades is the military wing of the Palestinian Hamas organization for assassination. It is clear that increasing the self-defense and deterrence of Islamic resistance groups in the occupied territories has made the Zionist enemy to realize one of its most important war policies, namely, “the policy of terror” has failed. Within a few days of come back of the Zionist regime, resistance groups fired a total of 500 missiles and rockets at the Zionist settlement that shocked the most powerful Zionist military commanders. It was a massive missile force that not only forced the enemy to retreat but also led Zionist authorities and their affiliated media to admit defeat to resistance.
