TEHRAN - The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday summoned London’s ambassador to Tehran, Simon Shercliff, over Britain’s meddlesome remarks about Iran’s internal affairs. “The Islamic Republic of Iran considers interference of the British Foreign Office in the internal affairs of Iran through resort to bogus and provocative interpretations” as unacceptable “and strongly condemns it,” the Foreign Ministry director general for Western Europe said in a report on Wednesday. “Unfortunately, by issuing one-sided and selective statements, the British side shows that it virtually has a share in orchestrating scenarios of those adversaries who are acting in that country against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the director general said. The Foreign Ministry also said the Islamic Republic will consider possible options in response to any “unconventional measure” by the British side. Britain’s Foreign Office said on Monday it had summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires, Iran’s most senior diplomat in Britain, over what it called a “shocking” crackdown on protests following the death of Mahsa Amini, Press TV reported. “Today we have made our view clear to the Iranian authorities. Instead of blaming external actors for the unrest, they should take responsibility for their actions and listen to the concerns of their people,” British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said. Also in late September, the Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador over the “hostile atmosphere” created by the London-based Farsi-language TV channels, such as Iran International, the BBC Persian and Manoto, against developments in Iran. At the time the Foreign Ministry strongly protested Britain for hosting such media outlets, saying they had been fiercely trying to inflame violent protests in Iran. Protests erupted in several cities over the death of Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman who fainted at a police station in mid-September and pronounced dead at hospital. Iran has been investigating the cause of the death, saying it will publish a report as soon as it concludes the probe.
