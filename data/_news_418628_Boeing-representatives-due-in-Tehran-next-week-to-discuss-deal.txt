TEHRAN – Representatives of the U.S. aircraft maker Boeing are due to visit Tehran next week to finalize financial parameters of their deal with Iran, Shargh Daily quoted Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan on Monday. “Last week, Iran Air’s Managing Director Farzaneh Sharafbafi had a meeting with Boeing representatives in Dubai and next week they will come to Tehran to finalize matters related to financing of the purchases,” the official said. Asked about the effect of possible new U.S. sanctions on deal with French aircraft maker Airbus, Fakhrieh Kashan said, “We are definitely taking all necessary measures to prevent any probable risk.” “All ambiguities must be cleared before signing any final contract,” he added. According to the official, Airbus is completely adhering to the deal so far, because if something happens “That would be them who suffer financial damage.” Iran Air inked a deal with Boeing on December 11, 2016 to buy 80 aircrafts valued at $16.6 billion. It is Iran’s biggest deal with an American company since the 1979 revolution and the U.S. embassy takeover. The national flag carrier also signed a deal with the French giant plane maker Airbus on January 28, 2016 for the purchase of 118 Airbus jets worth $27 billion.
