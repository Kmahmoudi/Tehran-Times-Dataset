Men living in highlands and lowlands of the northern province of Gilan wear very different outfits.  Shepherds in mountainous parts of Gilan wear garments made from locally woven fabric, cut out by the tailor of the nearest hamlet, however, the peasants on the plains of Gilan wear European-style clothing purchased in the bazaars.  The men wear close-fitting skullcaps made either of four pieces of wooden fabric stitched together or of felt.  Old shepherds and woodcutters in highlands wrap themselves with mufflers and cape during the cold season.  Mountain herders and peasants wear skullcaps. Poorer peasants and older persons use the muffler and cape.   The men in lowlands wear European-style shirts. Depending on the weather, men put on over the tunic a waistcoat and a doublet. Merchants and town dwellers use a qaba, a long-sleeved garment, either cut straight and worn open or partly lapped and fitted to the waist with a flowing knee-length skirt.  According to Iranica Encyclopedia, travelers’ descriptions from the 19th and early 20th centuries include mention of two types of trousers. One, worn in summer by the peasants of the lowlands, was of light-blue cotton, calf length, and tied with a cord at the waist; the other, worn only in winter in the lowlands but all year round among the mountain pastoralists, which was made of rough wool or cotton and reached to the ankles. In summer men wear trousers of light material, a shirt, and occasionally a jacket when they go to the bazaar or to the teahouse.  In winter they put on several additional layers of clothing: a pajama, trousers of heavy material, an undershirt, two or three shirts, a waistcoat, and a jacket.  Variations for festive or socially important occasions are less emphatic than among women; Even bridegrooms for their weddings, put on the same type of clothing that they wear every day, though newer or seldom worn.  Iranians in different parts of the country used to wear ethnic costume in past time. In some regions, people still use traditional dresses. The clothes reveal facts about lifestyle, history and beliefs of the locals.   SB/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
