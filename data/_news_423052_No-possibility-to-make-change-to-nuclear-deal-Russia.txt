Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that there is no possibility to make changes to the 2015 nuclear deal.
 “We are seriously concerned by all of this - I am referring to comments made by the presidents of the United States and France about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iran nuclear program. Russia has repeatedly said that there is no possibility for some kind of revote for this document, changing or enlarging it,” Press TV quoted her as saying.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
