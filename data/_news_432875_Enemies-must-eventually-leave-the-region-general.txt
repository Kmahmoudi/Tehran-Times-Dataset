TEHRAN – Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps second-in-command, said on Monday the enemies of the Islamic Republic must eventually leave the region instead of expecting Iran to end its regional presence. “They want Iran to leave the region to clear the way for their dominance and allow them once again to control our borders [in order] to be able to create problems for the Iranian nation," Salami said in the city of Shahrekord. He said Iran is constantly altering its strategies in proportion to the enemies’ approaches, adding, “The enemy should not ask us to leave the region, because they themselves must leave the region.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
