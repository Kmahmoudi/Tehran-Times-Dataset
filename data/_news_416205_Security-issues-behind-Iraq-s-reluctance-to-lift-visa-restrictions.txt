TEHRAN – Iranian interior minister has said that due to security reasons the Iraqi government is reluctant to lift visa requirements for Iranian pilgrims. “Iraqi officials say the security conditions are not good enough for hosting a massive crowd (of pilgrims) without a visa,” Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said on Wednesday. He also said that if Iraqi authorities manage to resolve the issues, it’s possible that visa restrictions be lifted for Iranians during Arbaeen, an event marking the 40th day after the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hussein (AS).
