TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday that establishing the special purpose vehicle (SPV), a European mechanism which aims to facilitate trade with Iran in defiance of U.S. sanctions, has been faced with a number of problems as it is the first time such mechanism is implemented. Qassemi said facilitating trade between Iran and Europe is a substitute for the United States’ withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with world powers in July 2015, ISNA reported. He also called on the United Nations to defy Washington’s policies with regard to the deal by remaining committed to the international agreement.
