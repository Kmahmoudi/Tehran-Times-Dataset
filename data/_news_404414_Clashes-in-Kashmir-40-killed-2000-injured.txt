At least 40 people are now confirmed dead and over 2,000 others injured following days of violent clashes between protesters in Kashmir and Indian forces, but the government has put the number of fatalities at 36. Clashes erupted after Burhan Wani, a top figure in the pro-independence Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) group, was killed along with two others in a shootout with Indian troops on July 8. With a curfew entering its eleventh straight day, medical sources have expressed serious concern that a severe lack of blood donations and life-saving medicines could cause more deaths. Anti-riot troops have used live ammunition, pellet guns and tear gas to disperse the crowds and calm down the outrage over the past few days. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought its cooperation in ensuring the passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill and commended all parties for speaking in “one voice” on Kashmir which has been rocked by protests over the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani. At an all-party meeting on Sunday, Modi welcomed remarks by Ghulam Nabi Azad, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, who said no issue was more topical today than that of Kashmir. Agreeing with calls for a discussion on the Kashmir situation, the Prime Minister said: “Various parties have given statements on Kashmir events which benefited the country. This has sent a right message and I thank all the parties for the same.” Noting that important Bills including the GST will be taken up during the session, Modi expressed the hope that there will be meaningful discussions and outcomes.
Around 2,000 more Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were being sent to Kashmir, a government official said. About 2,800 troops of the CRPF were sent to assist the state police last week. Internet and mobile networks have already been suspended in the region, and authorities have halted cable television broadcasting. The state government has ordered restrictions on the movement of people and traffic in several parts of the valley. It said in a statement that only people involved in medical emergencies would be allowed to travel across the troubled region. Kashmir has been at the heart of a bitter territorial dispute since India and Pakistan became independent in 1947. New Delhi and Islamabad both claim the Himalayan region in full, but rule parts of it. The two countries have fought two wars over the disputed territory. India is blinding young Kashmiri protesters Meantime, two sets of images have haunted me these last few days. One is a series of photos of people splashing bucket loads of water to wash away blood from the streets of Kashmir, where Indian forces have shot dead at least 45 people since 9 July. Thousands came out to protest and mourn the death of a rebel leader who was killed in an encounter with the Indian army and police. The other set of images is that of scores of young men with bandages on their eyes, before or after undergoing surgery to remove tiny steel pellets from their retinas. Indian forces deployed in Kashmir now routinely use pellet guns to stymie roadside demonstrations. The second set of images is relatively new, as it’s the fruit of “non-lethal” weapons introduced in Kashmir in 2010. But the pictures haunt you nonetheless, as you peer into the bloodied, plum-sized eyes of those who suspect they may never see again.
