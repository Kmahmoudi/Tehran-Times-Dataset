TEHRAN – “Sofreh: The Art of Persian Celebration”, a two-volume book on Persian spreads, was introduced during a special ceremony at Tehran’s Shirin Art Gallery on Friday. Published by ACC Art Books in UK, the book is written by Iranian collector Maryam Khosrowshahi in English with historical essays by Dutch Iranologist Willem Floor and a preface by Iranian artist Parviz Tanavoli. The version, which was unveiled at the gallery, has been republished by Vijeh Publications in Tehran. The book was originally unveiled in 2013 in London and later in Vancouver in 2016. It will later go to Los Angeles within a few months after Iran. The first volume is about the special spread set up during Noruz, the Persian New Year celebration, and the second book explores the spreads that are decorated as part of wedding customs in Iran. “The book also covers the spreads that Ms. Khosrowshahi herself decorated,” Tanavoli told the Persian service of ILNA at the ceremony.   “The spreads include the original items but look much richer, more artistic and more creative,” he added. “Ms. Khosrowshahi has gradually enhanced the spreads in her collections and has actually made new artistic installations, and several photographers have taken beautiful photos of the spreads all gathered in the book,” he added. “Ms. Khosrowshahi long ago left Iran. She is an art enthusiast, a collector of Iranian textiles, hand-woven textiles decorated with embroidery and needlework,” Tanavoli said.   Khosrowshahi has lived, worked and studied in Iran, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Switzerland, where she now works on the research and design of her personal projects. On the website set up for the book is written, “These two lavishly illustrated volumes devoted to compositions created for the Persian New Year and marriage ceremonies are beautifully presented and richly documented.” It also adds, “The history and symbolism of ancient Persian customs are discussed. References to Persian poetry, literature, art and folklore stimulate the imagination, and the text is illuminated with exquisite details of old manuscripts, antique woven textiles and embroideries.” Photo: A poster “Sofreh” republished by Vijeh Publications in Tehran
