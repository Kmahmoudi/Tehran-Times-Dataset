TEHRAN – Ahmad Vahidi, president of the Supreme National Defense University, said on Saturday that Iran’s enemies have always failed in their policy of economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic, stressing the new U.S. sanctions will fail as well. “The Islamic Revolution has so far thwarted many plots hatched by the enemies,” Brigadier General Vahidi said, adding that the Islamic Republic will, as always, emerge victorious against such plots, Mehr reported. Pointing to Saddam Hussein’s war against Iran in the 1980s, he said the war was one of the plots hatched by the enemies, after which an even stronger Islamic Republic emerged.  MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
