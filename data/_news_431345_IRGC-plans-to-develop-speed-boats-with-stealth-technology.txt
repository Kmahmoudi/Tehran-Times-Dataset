TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps announced on Monday that it plans to upgrade its speed boats in the Persian Gulf with radar-evading stealth technology and new missile launchers. “We are trying to increase the agility of the Guards’ speed boats and equip them with stealth technology to facilitate their operations,” Alireza Tangsiri, the IRGC Naval Force chief, was quoted as saying by IRNA. Tangsiri also said the speed boats will be equipped with new missiles, and their speed will reach 80 knots per hour. The IRGC last week launched war games in the Persian Gulf, where third of the world’s sea-borne oil passes through, and warned that its forces were ready to respond to any hostile U.S. action. A U.S.-Iranian war of words has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump took Washington out of a world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran in May, and reimposed sanctions on its banking and energy sectors. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani recently warned that if the country cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, a threat which many have taken as meaning to block the strategic Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.
