TEHRAN – Tehran was severely critical on Saturday of comments by Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir who again had accused Iran of backing terrorism, calling his remarks “hackneyed and boring.” “The groundless accusations and unsubstantiated claims by the Saudi officials, particularly those by Mr. al-Jubeir, against the Islamic Republic’s constructive and positive role and efforts in the region have become excessively hackneyed and boring,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said in an announcement.  
Speaking in the Japanese capital of Tokyo on Friday, Adel al-Jubeir accused Tehran of committing aggressive acts in the Middle East and shipping arms to Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, according to Press TV. 
The spokesm“The groundless accusations and unsubstantiated claims by the Saudi officials, particularly those by Mr. al-Jubeir, against the Islamic Republic’s constructive and positive role and efforts in the region have become excessively hackneyed and boring,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. an called on the Saudi decision-makers to revise their political approach toward the region. 
“Saudi Arabia would be better off reconsidering its behavior in the region seriously, and it is necessary that rationality replace illusion.”  
Saudis’ blame game is increasingly losing force, Iran says, as the people in the region have come to grips with the behind-the-scene realities.  
“Today, more than before, the public opinion have come to know the hidden reality of the region and main causes of instability and insecurity, and propaganda and distortion of realities are no longer able to deceive the informed and vigilant conscience,” Qassemi said in the statement carried on the Foreign Ministry website.  He added, “It is the Saudi government that needs to change its incorrect and unconstructive approach in the region and across the world and, while it is needed to cease strikes against the unprotected Yemeni women and children, it should stop backing terrorist groups in regional countries, particularly in Syria.”  Relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia have been strained over a number of issues, particularly over Syria, where the two back opposing sides in the now five-year conflict.  
The two states have had no direct political contact when Saudi Arabia severed its ties with Tehran after an Iranian mob attacked the Saudi diplomatic posts in Tehran and Mashhad following the kingdom’s execution of a top Saudi Shiite cleric in January.  
Contrary to Tehran who backs the Syrian government via it advisory role in the Syrian battlefield, Riyadh is seeking to topple it. 
“The advisory presence of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Syria and its spiritual and political supports for the innocent people of some regional Islamic countries afflicted by the unbridled barbarity and violence of Takfiri-terrorist groups works toward preserving stability and security in the region…,” part of the announcement read.  
Qassemi further called on all regional countries to orchestrate a concerted push toward restoring peace and stability to the beleaguered Middle East.  
“…all regional countries are expected to make efforts to restore security and calmness and prevent more killing of the Yemeni people through adopting a positive approach and acting constructively and practically.”  According to the announcement, Iran’s top priorities are security in the region, the annihilation of terrorism, preservation of the territorial integration of all countries, unity of the Islam world, and peace and stability in the region.  AK/PA
