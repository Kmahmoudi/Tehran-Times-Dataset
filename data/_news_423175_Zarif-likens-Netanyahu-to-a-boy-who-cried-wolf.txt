TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has likened Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a “boy who cried wolf”. “The boy who can’t stop crying wolf is at it again. Undeterred by cartoon fiasco at UNGA,” Zarif tweeted on Monday. “You can only fool some of the people so many times.” The tweet by Zarif came ahead of a televised commotion by Netanyahu about the 2015 nuclear deal.
