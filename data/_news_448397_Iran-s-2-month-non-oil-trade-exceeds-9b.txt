Also on Sunday, Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) published on its news portal that the Iranian customs officials discussed reopening of Mehran border with Iraqi partners to resume trade as both nations have taken health measures to guarantee hygienic transportation of goods. Meanwhile, according to local authorities, Iran has resumed exports to neighboring Afghanistan through the Milak border crossing in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan Province.
