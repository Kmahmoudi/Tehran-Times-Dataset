TEHRAN – The heavy loss against England in the 2022 World Cup has passed. It’s time to keep fighting for the remaining matches in Group B. Iran football team are scheduled to meet Wales on Friday and play the U.S. four days later. Team Melli showed a poor performance in their opener against England and had a disappointing start to the campaign but National Team still have the chance to advance to the knockout stage if they can defeat Wales on Friday. Iran coach Carlos Queiroz has said they have to learn from defeat against England. “My view is simple and very pragmatic: the game finished in the first half when we conceded the goals that usually the Iran national team are not used to conceding,” Queiroz said. “Being 3-0 down, the only goal for our team was to enjoy the game and be part of one moment that we should keep brave, united, fighting and try to play our football in moments England allows us to do that. “But what I can say as a conclusion is we win or learn. We had the privilege to learn a lot of things with the English team and we are much better prepared now to play against Wales.” Iran can change their starting lineup against Wales and change the condition in their favor, however Wales have shown how strong they are and it will be a big challenge for the Persians to win the match.  Iran goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand will be doubt for match against Wales and it could be a great blow for Team Melli. Iran coaching staff must prepare the players mentally for the rest of the competition. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
