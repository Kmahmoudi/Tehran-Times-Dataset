TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that the current U.S. administration has adopted a unilateral and extreme nationalistic ideologies and in such a situation Iran has many things to say at the UN General Assembly.
 “They respect no agreement. They respect neither the (UN) Human Rights Council nor economic agreements and the Paris (climate) agreement… this administration has ideologies of unilateralism and extreme nationalism. In this situation, I think many countries especially Iran have many things to say,” he said before departure to New York to attend the 73th session of the UN General Assembly. He added that the UNGA is an opportunity for Iran to express its stance. “The international situation is not good. The U.S. is taking bullying actions more than ever. It [the U.S.] continues adopting unilateral policies and imagines it can take actions based on force. When a country hosts an organization, it should not think that it has full authority over that organization. The U.S. authority over the United Nations should be to the same extent as of other countries,” Rouhani stated. Elsewhere, Rouhani said that the U.S. seeks to cause chaos in Iran, however, he said Washington will never reach its objectives. The U.S. will regret, because it has chosen a wrong path, he added. ‘Iran will respond to Ahvaz terrorist attack’ Rouhani also said that Iran will respond to terrorist attack in Ahvaz, the capital of Khuzestan province, which left 25 people, including women and children, dead. “It is obvious for us that they [the terrorists] are affiliated to what group. Those who make claims about the human rights should stand accountable. The U.S. supports mercenary countries in the region and provides them with help, however, these actions do not affect our people’s determination. We will respond to these crimes and all the perpetrators will be punished,” the president pointed out.
