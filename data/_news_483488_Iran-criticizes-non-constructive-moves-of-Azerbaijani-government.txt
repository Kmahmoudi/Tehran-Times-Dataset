TEHRAN – The Iranian foreign ministry has reacted to a series of actions by the Azerbaijani that escalated tensions between Tehran and Baku. Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani has reacted to some harsh, emotional and non-constructive moves of the Azerbaijani government against Iranian teachers and diplomats in Baku, according to the Iranian foreign ministry.  Kanaani said, “We believe that such a behavior by the government of the Republic of Azerbaijan is at odds with the principles of neighborliness." He added that while crises and tension have engulfed the occupied Palestinian territories and the Zionist regime is at its weakest point there and at a time when the regime wants to distract attention from its multiple internal crises inside occupied Palestine by attacking fasting Muslims and desecrating al-Aqsa Mosque, the Islamic Republic of Iran thinks that focusing on unity in the Muslim world and simultaneously countering normalization of ties with the criminal and usurping regime of Israel is a must and a religious and humane duty.   Kanaani urged the Azerbaijani government to observe mutual respect, move toward good neighborly ties and avoid what is desired by the Zionists and enemies of the region. The Foreign Ministry spokesman added that the Islamic Republic of Iran underlines the need for observing the principles of neighborly relations and watching out for the evil aim of the Zionist regime to cause division and tension in ties between Muslim countries. At the same time, Kanaani added, Tehran is contemplating diplomatic moves in response. Spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry Aykhan Hajizada responded to the Iranian foreign ministry statement. The statements of Kanaani regarding the announcement of four employees of the Iranian Embassy in Azerbaijan persona non grata for activities not corresponding to diplomatic status and contradicting the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, are biased and emotional, Hajizada claimed, according to Azerbaijani media.
