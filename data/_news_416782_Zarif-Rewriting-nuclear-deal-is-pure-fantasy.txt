TEHRAN – Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that renegotiating the July 2015 nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is just a “pure fantasy”. “The #JCPOA is not (re)negotiable. A ‘better’ deal is pure fantasy,” Zarif tweeted. Zarif added, “About time for U.S. to stop spinning and begin complying, just like Iran.” The tweet by Zarif came after Bloomberg reported Donald Trump and some of his senior officials are now reported to have a new plan in mind — not to blow up the deal but to renegotiate a better one.
On Thursday Trump again ramped up its rhetoric on the nuclear agreement, saying, "You'll see what I'm going to be doing very shortly in October."
Trump is expected to recertify Iran’s nuclear compliance before October 15.
Trump again said, "The Iran deal is one of the worst deals I've ever seen.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
