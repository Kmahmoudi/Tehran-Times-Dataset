TEHRAN – Ali Fadavi, the deputy chief of the IRGC, said on Tuesday that a number of persons who were detained in the recent riots in the country were linked to American intelligence and spy services. “These individuals were not just in contact with (Iran) International, which is a subdivision of the spy services of the foes, but were linked to intelligence and spy services of America,” Fadavi stated. He added, “We are waiting the judicial apparatus to investigate their cases.” Pointing to arrest of the leaders of networks connected to foreign media outlets, he also said, “It is for 44 years that there is a ‘war’ between the right and the wrong (and) the Islamic Revolution front (is standing) against the wrong front of the enemies. The other side does whatever it can. However, all through these 44 years they have not had a single victory.” Fadavi added, “We also do whatever God has ordered us to do to defeat the enemy.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
