TEHRAN â€“ A total of ten ancient Iranian villages, scattered across the western Kurdestan province, have recently been inscribed on the National Heritage List. Halvan, Dulab, Takhteh, Vasi-ye Olya, Shian, Zhan and four other mountainous villages were added to the list by the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization on Wednesday, CHTH reported. Some of the villages are within the Uraman cultural landscape which contains rows of dense and step-like rows of houses. Uraman is considered a cradle of Kurdish art and culture from the days of yore. The CHHTO is following up on possible inscription of the cultural landscape on the UNESCO World Heritage list by 2018.
