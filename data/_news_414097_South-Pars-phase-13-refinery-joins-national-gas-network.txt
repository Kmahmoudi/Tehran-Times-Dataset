TEHRAN- Refinery of phase 13 of developing Iran’s South Pars gas field (in the Persian Gulf) was connected to the country’s national gas network, Payam Motamed, the operator of the phase, announced. He said the produced sweet gas will be injected to the national network in autumn, Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), which is in charge of developing the gas field, wrote in its official website on Friday. Motamed further put the progress of developing the onshore part of phase 13 at 87 percent. The project for development of phase 13 is aimed at daily extraction of 56 million cubic meters (mcm) of enriched gas from South Pars field. Once the operation is complete, the phase will yield 50 mcm of sweet gas, 75,000 barrels of gas condensate and 400 tons of sulfur per day in addition to one million tons of ethane and one million tons of propane and butane per annum. South Pars is divided into 24 standard phases of development in the first stage. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment. The huge offshore field, shared with Qatar, covers an area of 9,700 square kilometers, 3,700 square kilometers of which, called South Pars, are in Iran’s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf. The remaining 6,000 square kilometers, called North Dome, are situated in Qatar’s territorial waters. The field is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate. MA/MG
