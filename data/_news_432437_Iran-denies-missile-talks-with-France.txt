TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has denied any talks with France over Tehran’s missile program, calling claim of missile talks an “absolute lie”.
 “Missile program is an internal issue and we will not hold talks on it. The country’s internal policies are set inside the country and we act based on these policies,” he said in an interview with the Young Journalists Club published on Tuesday. Iran’s position on its missile program is “clear” and “unchangeable”, he noted. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that France was ready to impose further curbs if no progress was made in talks over the program, Reuters reported. Qassemi said, “The French foreign minister may have meant the political talks that have being held every six months at the level of deputy foreign minister.” “We talk about regional and political issues with France ... but our missile capability is not negotiable ... we have repeatedly said that during our political talks with France,” he said.
