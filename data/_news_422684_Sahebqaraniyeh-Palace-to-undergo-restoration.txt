TEHRAN – The 19th-century Sahebqaraniyeh Palace in northern Tehran will undergo extensive restoration project after some 2.5 years of closure. Heritage experts are about to commence a rehabilitating mission as related studies have been completed, ISNA quoted Rahmatollah Ra’ouf, head of the complex, as saying on Saturday. Speaking about deteriorating situation of the palace, Ra’ouf said: “In 2010, a crack appeared on the ceiling of its Hozkhaneh hall … and one of its chandeliers fell down in 2013. Later in 2014, some cracks started to run on Talar-e Aineh (Mirror Hall) of the palace.” Beautifully decorated and fully-furnished interior spaces of the palace feature loads of art works including precious paintings and sculptures by Iranian and foreign artists. The palace stands within the Niavaran Cultural-Historical Complex, which houses 19th- and 20th-century landmark buildings, museums and monuments in an area of about eleven hectares.
