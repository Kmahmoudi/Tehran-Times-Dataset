TEHRAN – With just a month-and-half left to the presidential polls, President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday that election is key to “democracy” and is a “principle of legitimacy”. 
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran relies on the people’s vote and election and the country’s long term objectives are fulfilled in this way,” he said during a meeting with state directors and managers. He attached great importance to the people’s participation in the elections, saying it will boost the country’s international status. The president urged officials to encourage maximum participation in the elections.  He added, “People should have hope on the ballot box. People’s disappointment will be an end to democracy.” Rouhani also said that a “healthy, transparent and competitive atmosphere” should be created to help the people make the right choice. He added, “Some are making efforts to turn the facts upside down to undermine the government, but such act makes the people disappointed and undermines the system, country and people.”  Elsewhere, Rouhani called on the state directors and managers to make efforts to increase production and create jobs. “Employment is one of the most important economic and social issues in the country. Hope and peace of mind will be raised in the society if the people feel that (plans to create) job is on the right track,” he noted. He said that a production which helps create jobs opportunities is a “religious, national and revolutionary duty”. The government created jobs for 700,000 people in the past year and plans to create more jobs in the new calendar year, which began on March 21, he said. Rouhani also said that improvements in the health sector are a source of pride for his government.
