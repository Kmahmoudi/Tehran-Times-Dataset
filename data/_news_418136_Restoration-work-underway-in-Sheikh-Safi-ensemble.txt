TEHRAN â€“ Sheikh Safi al-din Shrine Ensemble, a UNESCO World Heritage in northwest Iran, is being restored. A patchwork of murals and frescos have so far been rehabilitated, ISNA reported on Tuesday. The scheme also includes tilework, plasterwork and woodwork projects. As a spiritual retreat in the Sufi tradition, the ensemble was built between the beginning of the 16th century and the end of the 18th century. It embraces well-preserved and richly ornamented facades and interiors, with a remarkable collection of antique artefacts.
