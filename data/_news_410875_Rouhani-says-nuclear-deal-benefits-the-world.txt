TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday defended the nuclear agreement between Iran and the 5+1 group, calling it a win-win game which benefits all the parties, the region and the larger world.
 The president also said the historic nuclear agreement can serve as model for resolving regional crises including the Syria conflict. Iran, Russia and Turkey have succeeded to broker a ceasefire between the warring sides in Syria and also brought the hostile forces to the negotiating table in Astana, Kazakhstan, on January 23-24.
 
“The (nuclear) agreement is a win-win game and beneficial to all and the region. The Astana talks is being held. The nuclear negotiations can be a model for other talks that lead to security and stability in the region,” Rouhani said during a speech at a ceremony held to mark the 34th Islamic Republic of Iran National Award for the Book of the Year. He said the nuclear negotiations were the result of “great national political power” in Iran. “Then, some (at home) were against the talks, but heroic flexibility proposed by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei opened the way,” he noted. Iran and the 5+1 group (the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany) finalized the text of the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in July 2015. It took effect in January 2016. Trump has toughened his language against Iran in recent days. In interview with Fox News published on Sunday, Trump said, “They [Iran] have total disregard for our country.” Trump has said he is seeking a review of the nuclear deal which has been approved by the UN Security Council. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on November 9 that the JCPOA is a “multilateral agreement” and that she is tasked to guarantee its full implementation. EU foreign ministers also issued a statement on November 14 reiterating the 28-nation bloc’s “resolute” commitment to the implementation of the nuclear agreement. NA/PA
