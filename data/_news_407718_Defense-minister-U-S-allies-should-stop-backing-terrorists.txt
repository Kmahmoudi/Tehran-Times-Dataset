TEHRAN - To end the crises in Middle East the U.S. and its allies should stop supporting terrorists and abandon the idea of partitioning countries in the region, Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan said on Wednesday.
 There are reports that the Al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate, is using civilians as human shield in the Syrian city of Aleppo and prevents them from leaving the city.  “The U.S. and its regional and extra-regional allies chant humanitarian slogans while giving the terrorist groups such as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham or Al-Nusra Front green light and prevent the people from getting out of the military regions so that they be used as human shields.”  Russia and the Syrian army resumed bombing Aleppo after a pause.  The United States and its allies have been critical of Russia and Syria for targeting Al-Nusra militants in eastern Aleppo.  Dehqan said the Islamic Republic has repeatedly warned about the danger of terrorist groups to international security, however the hegemonic powers are backing these groups.  He also said that spread of terrorism and extremism in the region is aimed at serving the interests of the Zionist regime of Israel.
