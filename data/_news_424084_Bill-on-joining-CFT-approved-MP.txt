TEHRAN – The vice chairman of the parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee said on Tuesday that the bill on joining the convention on Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) was approved earlier in the day during a meeting of the committee. Kamal Dehqani Firouzabadi said the committee has conditionally approved the bill to protect the country’s national security and to meet the requirements set forth by the lawmakers, ISNA reported. The parliamentary committee discussed the bill during two sessions and after receiving comments and reports of government bodies and Judiciary experts, it approved the bill with certain conditions, he stated. The parliamentarian added that one of the conditions is that if the bill contradicts with the constitution, the implementation of the constitution is given priority, and the other is that Iran would join the CFT only if it is removed from FATF blacklist.
