TEHRAN - President-elect Donald Trump divided the American society through hate remarks during the campaign speeches. He created the rift by dividing the people based on their religion, color, culture, among other things, showing disdain for Muslims, Latinos and the disabled.  His campaign speeches revived the smells of racism and fascism.  Now it would be too much difficult to heal the wounds opened in the multicultural American society. The United States has been proud of its respect for human dignity irrespective of origin, skin color, religion, gender, etc.  However, Trump defied all these values. Trump’s victory also heartened populists, nationalists, hardliners and extremists in America and around the world. His statements on international issues have also sent shockwaves across the world.  The French president said Trump’s win “opens up a period of uncertainty” that “must be faced with lucidity and clarity”. He said Trump must clarify his position on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal among other things. In a statement the German chancellor also sought to know about the president-elect’s “climate policy.” Trump had rejected the validity of science by surprisingly calling climate change a “hoax”. This statement is more embarrassing than anything else because it may put the Paris climate agreement in jeopardy.  The German foreign minister also said, “…I hope that we aren’t facing bigger tectonic shifts in international politics (under the Trump presidency).” Dan McAdams, a professor of psychology at Northwestern University in Illinois, believes Trump is highly unstable and considers him to be a neurotic narcissist. Arshin Adib-Moghaddam, head of the Iran center at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, told the Tehran Times that Trump must be considered “the most dangerous man in the world today” because of his “politically uncivilized persona and lack of intelligence”. Now, it remains to be seen how Trump will heal the wounds he opened in the American society and how he will approach issues of international concern.  However, early signs are not promising as Trump is recruiting “neo-conservatives”.  In interviews with CNN, white nationalist leaders, who vehemently oppose multiculturalism, have praised Trump's decision to name former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. According to media reports, John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani, two hawks who strongly defended the war on Iraq under the Bush administration, are also being floated as candidates for the post of secretary of state.  However, there is a hope that moderate Republicans will tame Trump and the hardliners surrounding him.
