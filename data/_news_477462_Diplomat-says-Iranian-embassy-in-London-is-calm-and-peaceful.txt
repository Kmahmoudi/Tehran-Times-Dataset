TEHRAN- The Iranian chargé d'affaires has said Tehran’s embassy in London is quiet and the Islamic Republic's flag is being raised once more. Speaking to IRNA on Sunday night, Mehdi Hosseini-Matin stressed that the Islamic Republic’s flag that the anti-revolutionary elements had insulted is hoisting again in its proper location. Following the attack on Iran's representative office that was carried out by anti-revolutionary forces while London Police were not there, the official said that things are now peaceful. He said after the recent violent actions, those individuals scaled the embassy's structure and insulted "our country's flag" in addition to breaking several windows. It appeared that they had rushed to destroy the Iranian embassy building when there were no police around, he added. Five males, according to the London police, have been detained for vandalizing the representative's office, and three more men and a woman have been held for disturbing the tranquility and assaulting police officers. The Iranian embassy personnel have frequently emphasized the need to increase security following the anti-revolutionary attacks on the representative office. In a related development, Nasser Kanaani, the spokesperson for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated a few days ago that, in accordance with the Vienna Convention, countries are tasked to provide security for foreign embassies, and that the Foreign Ministry has emphasized the necessity of ensuring the security of its embassies through telephone contacts. However, it still appears that the UK government is not taking real steps to secure the embassy.
