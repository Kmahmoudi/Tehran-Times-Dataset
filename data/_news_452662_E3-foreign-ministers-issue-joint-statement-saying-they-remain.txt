In a joint statement the foreign ministers of the three European countries party to the 2015 nuclear deaL issued a joint statement on Sunday, September 2, stating that they “remain committed” to the JCPOA endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2231. The statement by foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, known as E3, followed after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday evening that the U.S. has reimposed UN sanctions against Iran.  “The E3 remains committed to fully implementing UNSCR 2231 (2015) by which the JCPoA was endorsed in 2015,” they said, according to gov.uk. Following is the text of the statement:  Today marks 30 days since the US sought to initiate the ‘snapback mechanism’, which allows a participant to the JCPoA to seek the re-imposition of the multilateral sanctions against Iran lifted in 2015 in accordance with resolution 2231, adopted by the UN Security Council. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (“the E3”) note that the US ceased to be a participant to the JCPoA following their withdrawal from the deal on 8 May, 2018. Consequently, the purported notification under paragraph 11 of UNSCR 2231 (2015), received from the United States of America and circulated to the UN Security Council Members, is incapable of having legal effect. It flows from this that any decisions and actions which would be taken based on this procedure or on its possible outcome would also be incapable of having any legal effect. We remain guided by the objective of upholding the authority and integrity of the United Nations Security Council. The E3 remains committed to fully implementing UNSCR 2231 (2015) by which the JCPoA was endorsed in 2015. We have worked tirelessly to preserve the nuclear agreement and remain committed to do so.
