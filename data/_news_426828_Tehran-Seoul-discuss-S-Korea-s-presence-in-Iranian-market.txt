Making the remarks in this meeting, Iran’s Ambassador to Seoul Mohammad Hassan Taherian highlighted South Korean companies’ long presence and good reputation in Iran’s domestic market. “The growth in Iran-South Korea trade ties during the past recent months is due to the efforts of the South Korean small and medium-sides enterprises (SMEs),” he said.   Underscoring that Chinese, Indian, Russian, and Turkish companies are competing with each other to find a share from Iran’s market, the Iranian envoy proposed South Koreans to continue their presence in Iran under the current circumstance.
