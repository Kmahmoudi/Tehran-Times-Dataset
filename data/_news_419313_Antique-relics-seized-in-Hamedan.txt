TEHRAN – Three historical objects have been confiscated in an anti-smuggling operation in Hamedan, west central Iran, Mehr reported on Tuesday. The raid, followed by an intelligence operation, yielded two copper vessels and a piece of engraved metal which had been concealed at the home of a local citizen, Mehr reported on Tuesday.  Experts with the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization suggest the objects date back to Seljuk (1037–1194) and Qajar (1789–1925) eras.  The seizure was carried out in coordination with the judicial body and the CHTHO conservation unit.  AFM/MQ/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
