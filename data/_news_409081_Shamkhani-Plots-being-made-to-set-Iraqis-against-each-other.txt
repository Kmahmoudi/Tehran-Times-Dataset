TEHRAN - Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said on Monday that “mysterious efforts” are being made to create division among Iraqis and undermine their unity.
 “Mysterious efforts are being made to create division among the Iraqi people which should be foiled by awareness, altruism and convergence of the Iraqi groups,” he said during a meeting with Chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) Ammar Hakim and his accompanying delegation. Shamkhani said that campaigns against terrorists by various ethnic and religious groups indicate unity and integrity among Iraqi people.  The important role of the popular mobilization forces in fighting the Takfiri terrorists demonstrates that the involvement of people is vital in the process of establishing security, noted Shamkhani, a former defense minister and IRGC Naval Force chief. Elsewhere, Shamkhani suggested that Islamic countries and the larger world must put fight against the roots of extremism on their agenda. For his part, Hakim praised Iran’s supports for the Iraqi people and government. He also attached great importance to Iraq’s “political and territorial integrity”. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met separately with Hakim on Monday. Zarif said the close relationship between Iran and Iraq can be a role model of regional interaction. NA/PA
