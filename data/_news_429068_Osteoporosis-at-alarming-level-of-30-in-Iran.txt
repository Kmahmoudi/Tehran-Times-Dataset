TEHRAN - The prevalence rate of Osteoporosis is at alarming level as 30% of Iranians have the disease, said Baqer Larijani, deputy health minister who doubles as director general of the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute. He made the remarks in a one-day symposium on osteoporosis updates in Tehran on Thursday, IRNA reported.    In Iran, 1 in every 3 women and 1 in every 5 men over the age of 50 are suffering from osteoporosis, he noted. The symposium was held to develop scientific techniques and pass on relevant experience on osteoporosis in order to fight the disease.  Osteoporosis reduces density and quality of bones, so the risk of fracture is greatly increased. The loss of bone occurs silently and progressively. Often there are no symptoms until the first fracture occurs. According to the International Osteoporosis Foundation, Osteoporosis causes more than 8.9 million fractures annually, resulting in an osteoporotic fracture every 3 seconds.
