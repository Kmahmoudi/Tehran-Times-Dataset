TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that it is essential for all the countries in the region to respect each other’s interests, according to ISNA.
 
Writing an article in the Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak, Zarif said any act by the regional countries in line with seeking superiority will cause instability. He also called arms race as an example of destructive rivalries in the region which will not help establish peace and stability. The chief diplomat also attached great importance to “dialogue” and “trust-building acts” as steps to stabilize the region. As a first step, he said, Iran proposes holding regional dialogue conference on the Persian Gulf security. Iran is waiting for the day that its neighbors accept this proposal, he added. NA/PA
