In an interview with Euronews on Wednesday, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani described U.S. President Donald Trump as a liar, denouncing the U.S. president for calling Iran “the terrorist nation". Euronews correspondent in Tehran asked Shamkhani for his view on the U.S., Europe and how relations with Iran are progressing. “Unfortunately, Trump is a liar. The U.S. imposes sanctions on Iran, supports the growth of terrorism in Iraq and Syria, and bombards Yemen,” he told euronews. “When Trump calls Iran ‘the terrorist nation’, or distorts the 2,500 years of history the “Persian Gulf” has, by calling it the “Arabian Gulf”, people realize that they are being targeted.” He made the remarks in the wake of Washington’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal. Europe needs to do more than just lip service Asked about the role of Europe since the nuclear agreement was struck, Shamkhani said, “It has always been our plan to develop our ties and relations with Europe within our values and beliefs.” However, he said, the truth is that Europe has not done the same since the nuclear deal was signed. “It has mainly paid lip service, with a few exceptions. It is now stating that it is against the elimination of the nuclear deal by the U.S.,” Admiral Shamkhani added. Ayatollah Khamenei, Leader of the Islamic Revolution, on Wednesday welcomed the European governments for condemning Trump’s refusal to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal. However, the leader said, “This is not enough for them to say that he (Trump) should not tear up the JCPOA. The JCPOA serves their interests.” The Leader also said, “As long as the other party has not torn up the JCPOA, we will not tear it up,” said the Leader. However he warned that Iran will rip the deal into shreds if the other side decides to tear it up. On October 7 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, “The nuclear negotiations and deal have achieved benefits that are irreversible. Nobody can roll them back, neither Mister Trump nor 10 other Trumps.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
