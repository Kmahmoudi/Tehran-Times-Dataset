TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Wednesday criticized recent remarks against Iran by Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, saying he is following the same wrong, futile approach pursued by Riyadh in recent years. “It is highly regrettable that the Saudi foreign minister still insists on following the same wrong, costly and futile approach pursued by this country (Saudi Arabia) over the recent years, and is continuing to bang the drum for tension and violence as well as destructive behavior and policies,” Qassemi was quoted by Tasnim as saying. Qassemi also urged Saudi officials to reconsider their approach towards the Islamic Republic, instead of being infatuated with Washington’s hostility against Tehran. Such approach, he said, will cause the kingdom, its people and the region to fall victim to Saudi Arabia’s illusionary, wrong and superficial calculations. The spokesman also advised Riyadh to accept the realities in the region based on farsightedness and in accordance with their interests and responsibilities and without any “prejudice” and “obstinacy”. The remarks came in reaction to Jubeir’s address to the annual Chatham House conference in London on Tuesday. Saudi Arabia supports U.S. President Donald Trump’s stance on Iran after he decided not to certify that Tehran is complying with a nuclear accord, he said. The Saudi foreign minister said the nuclear deal, also called the JCPOA, had shortcomings, and that he agreed with Trump’s assessment that Iran was working to destabilize the region and was funding militant organizations. “(Iran’s behavior) is not acceptable, and there will be consequences to the Iranians. This is what President Trump has said, and we are very supportive of that,” he added. Earlier this month, Trump refused to formally certify Tehran’s compliance with the JCPOA, and threatened to exit the deal altogether. That put the issue in the hands of U.S. congressmen, who have until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the accord.
