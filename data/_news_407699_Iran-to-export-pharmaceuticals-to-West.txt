TEHRAN – Iran’s vice president for science and technology has announced the country’s plan to export pharmaceuticals to European countries in the near future. Sorena Sattari made the remarks while visiting a pharmaceutical company, which uses modern biotechnology in production of medicine, in the province of Alborz.  Sattari said that most of Iran’s pharmaceuticals have been produced using biotechnology. “Ninety-eight percent of the country’s required pharmaceuticals are produced domestically,” he noted. He also said that “since two years ago, Iran has exported large amounts of pharmaceuticals to neighboring countries, including Russia,” adding that the Islamic Republic aims to start exporting pharmaceuticals to European countries.  Following the implementation of the nuclear deal in January, Iran has been attempting to promote scientific cooperation with the world.  Earlier in October, a high-ranking scientific delegation visited Iran to discuss scientific cooperation between Tehran and Berlin.  During a joint meeting with the German delegation, Sattari boasted the Islamic Republic’s scientific achievements, saying, “Iran has made considerable progress in biotechnology.” Also, in a move to increase pharmaceutical ties with Russia, Iran in September launched a production line for raw material of Fingolimod, a drug used in treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), in Saint Petersburg.
