TEHRAN- A comprehensive plan to enhance bilateral cooperation has been agreed by the foreign ministries of Iran and Nicaragua. The agreement was signed on Sunday in Tehran by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Denis Moncada Colindres and his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir Abdollahian. The senior diplomats earlier in the day talked about recent regional and global developments as well as potential methods to strengthen bilateral relations. Amir Abdollahian praised the appropriate degree of connections between Tehran and Managua during the meeting, notably in the political sphere, and suggested that the two nations focus more on enhancing their trade and economic cooperation. Tehran is prepared to deepen the bilateral relationships in a variety of economic and commercial relations, he continued. The senior Iranian diplomat described the agreement as a "new and strategic" initiative to improve ties between the two nations. Nicaragua's foreign minister praised both his nation's cordial relations with Iran and their bilateral collaboration in international fora. Colindres expressed optimism that relations between Iran and Nicaragua will advance soon as a result of the recently agreed pact and the joint commission's first meeting. On the sidelines of the 77th General Assembly of the UN, Colindres and Amir Abdollahian had a meeting in September in New York.Â  In a phone call with Daniel Ortega in September 2021, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi stressed the importance of tight coordination with Nicaragua and other Latin American governments on the international scene in order to thwart U.S. sanctions against independent nations. In order to neutralize American sanctions and make it expensive for the U.S. administration to take action against independent states and nations, notably Iran and Nicaragua, close collaboration between the two countries at international scenes is essential, according to the Iranian president.
