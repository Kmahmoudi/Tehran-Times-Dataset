TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Tuesday that the Lebanese people’s participation in the parliamentary elections was a “negative response” to the U.S. and the Zionist regime of Israel.
 “The Lebanese people’s participation in the elections and victory of Hezbollah were a negative response to the U.S. and the Zionists,” he said in an open session of the parliament. Lebanon’s first parliamentary vote in nine years was held on Sunday. Unofficial results from Lebanon’s parliamentary elections show that Hezbollah and its political allies secured over half the seats, Press TV reported. In a televised speech on Monday, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of the Lebanese Hezbollah resistance movement, called the outcome a “national achievement”. Larijani congratulated Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, President Michel Aoun and Nasrallah on Hezbollah victory. Elsewhere in his remarks, Larijani told Trump that the result of the elections in Lebanon is a proof that the “oppressed nations will resist bullying”. Larijani who was speaking just hours before Trump announced his final decision on the 2015 nuclear accord warned Washington that refusing to remain committed to the multilateral agreement will yield similar results. “Mr. Trump! See the result of the U.S. and Zionists’ dishonesties in helping the terrorists in the past years in the votes of the great Lebanese people, and have no doubt that refraining to be committed to the nuclear issue will yield similar results…,” the top parliamentarian stated.
