TEHRAN —Philanthropists and some high ranking officials made a 21-billion-rial (nearly $600,000) contribution to release prisoners committed involuntary crimes, Blood Money Organization director said. The contributions were made over the 29th charity fund raising ceremony held in Tehran on Sunday arranged by Blood Money Organization with some MPs, judiciary and military officials in attendance, IRIB quoted Asadollah Jolaei as saying. Some 12.34 billion rials (nearly $350,000) was collected over the ceremony and those who were invited to the event but couldn’t show up also sent their contributions which increased the final sum to 21 billion rials, Jolaei noted. Additionally, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani, Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani and Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani also made 3-billion-rial ($85,700), 2.5-billion-rial ($71,400), 500-milion-rial ($14,200), and 500-million-rial ($14,200) contributions respectively, he added. He further explained that some 21,000 philanthropists made a 2.33-billion-rial ($66,500) contribution via their cellphones [by dialing a special number dedicated to charity fundraising activities]. It is customary for Iranians to hold special events to raise money for those who are imprisoned for involuntary crimes particularly in the month of Ramadan.
