TEHRAN – The deputy chief of the Iranian Army on Wednesday dismissed any need for presence of foreign powers in the Middle East, saying regional countries can ensure the security of the region. “The countries of the region can resolve issues and problems through dialogue and interaction,” Brigadier General Ahmadreza Pourdastan said in a meeting with Commander of the Royal Air Force of Oman Marshal Matar bin Ali al-Obaidani. Regional states have the capability to establish security in the region without the presence of outsiders, he added. MH/PA
