TEHRAN- The Ukrainian president claimed late on Wednesday that Iran had given Russia weapons to use in the war in Ukraine, but the Iranian foreign ministry denied such an allegation and cautioned Zelenskyy that Iran's strategic patience’ is limited. Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani issued a statement on Thursday denouncing the "hackneyed claims and discourteous statements" of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy against Iran in the U.S.  In his speech to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday night, Zelenskyy charged that Iran had supported Russia militarily in the war on Ukraine. “Iran poses a serious threat to Ukraine's infrastructure,” Zelenskyy claimed.  “When Russia cannot reach our cities with its artillery, it attempts to destroy them with missile assaults and allies in the murderous program with Iran,” he added. "Once again, we reiterate that the Islamic Republic of Iran has not transferred any military equipment to any party for use in the Ukraine war," Kanaani stated in response to the claims made by Ukrainian officials regarding drone sales to Russia. The spokesperson reminded the Ukrainian president that Iran's strategic tolerance with regard to the “unfounded claims” is limited. He reiterated Iran's support for the territorial integrity of all nations, including Ukraine. Kanaani added, “Mr. Zelenskyy had better take lessons from the destiny of those presidents of nations who depended on U.S. backing.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
