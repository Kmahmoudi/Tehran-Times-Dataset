TEHRAN – Iran’s Ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeedinejad, has said that Trump is seeking a “psychological-media objective” by calling for talks with Iran.
 “U.S. sets 12 impossible conditions for Iran and at the same time calls for talks without any condition at highest political level. They seek psychological-media objective by calling for talks,” Baeedinejad said in a post on his Instagram, ISNA reported on Wednesday. The ambassador also noted that the U.S. violated the 2231 resolution of the UN Security Council by quitting the 2015 nuclear deal in May and has “no clear policy for the future”. In a press conference at the White House on July 30, Trump said he would meet with Iran “anytime they want to” and without “preconditions”. However, hours after Trump’s statements, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CNBC to set some conditions. Back in May, Pompeo had set 12 conditions for talks with Iran, which were dismissed by Tehran. In remarks on August 13, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there will be no war between Iran and the U.S. and nor will be any negotiation between the two countries. The Leader noted that negotiation with the current U.S. administration is impossible. “Even if we were to negotiate with the U.S., we would never hold talks with the current U.S. administration.” NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
