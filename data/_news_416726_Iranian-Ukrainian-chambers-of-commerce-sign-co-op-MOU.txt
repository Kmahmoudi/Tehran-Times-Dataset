TEHRAN- Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (UCCI) and Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) signed a cooperation MOU during an Iran-Ukraine business forum in Ukraine, the portal of ICCIMA reported on Monday. The MOU was signed by President of UCCI Gennady Chijikov and the Chairman of ICCIMA Gholam-Hossein Shafeie, who led a delegation to the eastern European country. During the signing ceremony both sides underscored the significance of developing mutual economic cooperation. Addressing the held business forum, ICCIMA chairman underlined the importance of expanding economic bonds as well as banking ties between the two countries, saying that “the first step should be taken on tightening banking relations, since banking ties will ease joint investments and economic cooperation.”  “Iran can use its booming economy, available work force, and its suitable political condition in the region to pave the way for presence of Ukrainian companies in the regional markets,” he added. Chijikov, for his turn, expressed hope that bilateral trade relations between Iran and Ukraine will continue its positive trend in future as it did during the past two years.  Ukraine intends to increase agricultural trade with Iran up to $1 billion this year, said Vasyl Antonenko, the chief specialist of the bilateral trade and economic cooperation department of the International Cooperation Department of the Agrarian Policy and Food Ministry of Ukraine, in the mentioned forum. “Upon seven months of 2017, Iran ranks 8th among the importers of Ukrainian agricultural products. It is expected that we will be able to reach $1 billion agricultural products turnover by the end of this year due to joint efforts of the businesses of both countries,” he noted. HJ/MA
