TEHRAN – President Ayatollah Seyed Ebrahim Raisi has instructed the governor-general of Khuzestan province to look into the terrorist attack in Izeh. Expressing condolences to the families of the victims of the terrorist attack, the President had a telephone conversation with Governor General Sadegh Khalilian ordering him to follow up on the actions of the security and law enforcement agencies to identify and arrest the perpetrators and leaders of this tragic event in the shortest possible time, according to a statement by the Iranian presidency.  After the terrorist attack on people and police forces in the central market of Izeh, Raisi had a conversation with the governor general on Wednesday evening to be informed of the details of the incident. He ordered the security and law enforcement agencies to urgently identify the perpetrators of the deadly attack and hand them over to court to face trial. The terrorist attack took place on Wednesday night and claimed the lives of more than 7 people, including 10-year-old Kiyan Pirfalak, whose martyrdom plunged the entire nation into deep grief.  Offering his condolences to the families of the martyrs, Raisi ordered the provision of all necessary facilities to treat the injured. A funeral service for the victims of the attack was held on Friday. The ceremony was attended by high-level officials, including Mohsen Rezaei, the vice president for economic affairs.  Rezaei said on the sidelines of the funeral that the perpetrators were nabbed on Thursday on the border with the Republic of Azerbaijan while trying to flee the country.  He also said the enemy wants to replicate the Syria crisis in Iran. “The enemy, through creating insecurity, is aspiring to Syrianize [Iran] but this dream will not materialize with the mighty and knowing presence of this great nation,” he said, according to Iran’s state news agency IRNA.  The Iranian authorities have said that the enemy is waging a “hybrid war” against the Islamic Republic of Iran with the ultimate goal of bringing about a civil war in Iran à la the Syrian one. And this hybrid war, the official argument goes, is pursued through the media.  Also on Thursday, Raisi underlined the need for public relations agencies in countering the lies propagated by the enemy.  He advised all public relations managers to employ competent and committed personnel in this regard. "Public relations should be viewed as an important task because they are working against those who are trying to enumerate and magnify weaknesses and downplay strengths," he pointed out while speaking at the National Conference of Jihad of Explanation and Artistic Information. Referring to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution's emphasis on the necessity of “Jihad of Explanation” and thanking all those who play a role in enlightening the public opinion, the president said, "Jihadist work has a meaning and concept and it is different from normal work." He added, "In a jihadist movement, the jihadist must see and evaluate his own and insider's ability, mission, actions, as well as the enemy's actions, ability, capacities, methods, and tools, and then adjust his effort and movement to what is necessary for a jihadist movement." Raisi further referred to the important and effective role of rumormongers and liars in misleading society, suggesting that the “destructive role” of such persons should not be underestimated. The president said this movement is seeking to shape the perception of society based on their goals and interests. "In such an atmosphere where rumormongers and liars are trying to disrupt the society's perceptions, display good as bad, bad as good, highlight weak points and downplay the strengths, the role of public relations is very important."    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
