TEHRAN â€“ With the future of Jose Nestor Pekerman is still up in the air, the Colombian Football Federation is going to negotiate with Iran current coach Carlos Queiroz. With the 2019 Copa America in Brazil and the 2020 World Cup in Qatar ahead, the Colombian federation needs to arrange its plan for the future as soon as possible.  Argentine Gerardo "Tata" Martino is the main candidate to replace Pekerman at The Tricolors. Martino, who currently leads Atlanta United in MLS, has already worked at Paraguay and Argentina and has more chance to continue his successful career in Colombia. In addition to Martino, Juan Carlos Osorio and Carlos Queiroz are potential candidates to take charge of the Colombian team, Canal1.com reported. Osorio did not renew his contract after nearly three years in charge of Mexican football team. Queiroz has also yet to extend his contract with Iran national football team. Under guidance of the Portuguese coach, Iran fought to the last moment and only narrowly missed the chance to reach the knockout phase of the 2018 World Cup. Queiroz had been also linked with a move to Algeria and South Korea football teams. Mehdi Taj, the head of the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran (FFIRI), has said Queiroz will remain as Team Melli coach in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, where Iran have been drawn in Group D along with Iraq, Yemen and Vietnam.
