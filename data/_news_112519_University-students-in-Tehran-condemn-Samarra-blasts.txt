The protestors who gathered at Park Daneshju (student park) central Tehran, called for unity of Shia and Sunni Muslims to thwart the conspiracies of the global arrogance, led by the U.S. and the Zionists. Demonstrators chanted slogans against the U.S., Zionists and Britain. They also held signs showing their hatred toward the recent sacrilege of the Islamic religious values by the global arrogance and the Zionists. The students carried black flags as well as pictures of the Father of the Islamic Revolution, the late Imam Khomeini and the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. The demonstrators further left the park and walked toward the British Embassy in Tehran. While gathering in front of the embassy, they expressed their outrage over blasphemous caricatures of the holy Prophet Mohammad (Peace Be Upon Him) published by several Western media. The students signed a petition in condemnation of the bombing. They also wrote a letter addressing the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in which they condemned both the desecration of Muslims’ religious beliefs by printing blasphemous caricatures of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and the bomb blasts at the holy shrines in Iraq. At the end of their rally, the students also issued a statement. The statement said that the world of Islam, in recent weeks, has witnessed tragic events which do not leave any room for keeping silence any longer. The recent Middle East events are among pre-planned conspiracies designed in fear of awareness of the Muslim ummah (nation), it said adding that the events have fortunately resulted in further consolidation of Muslims across the globe. The Muslim ummah has wisely stood against all conspiracies and will not let the global arrogance and its allies sow discord among different Muslim sects, the statement further noted. The demonstrators also voiced their firm support for Iran's peaceful nuclear program.
