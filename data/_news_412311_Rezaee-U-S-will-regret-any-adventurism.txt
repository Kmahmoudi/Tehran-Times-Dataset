TEHRAN – After a top U.S. military commander threatened Tehran with military action, Expediency Council secretary Mohsen Rezaei warned Washington on Monday against any military “adventurism” 

 “You should know that Iran is neither Iraq nor Afghanistan and any adventurism will bring about regret for you,” Rezaei, the former IRGC chief, said on Monday in remarks addressed at Army General Joseph Votel.  In an Instagram post, Rezaei called Votel’s anti-Iran accusations "repetitive", saying "Iran's activities in the Persian Gulf and the region are aimed at maintaining security and peace."
