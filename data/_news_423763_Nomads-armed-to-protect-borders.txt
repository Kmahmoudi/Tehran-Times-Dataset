TEHRAN – Nosratollah Seif, commander of the Nomad Basij Organization, says his organization has recruited, organized and armed thousands of nomads as part of a plan to protect borders. According to the plan, the nomads will be authorized to own the weapons in order to protect the property and geographical areas in which they reside, Mehr quoted Seif as saying on Sunday. He added that because the nomads mainly live in border areas and impassable areas, they can protect and boost the country’s security.
