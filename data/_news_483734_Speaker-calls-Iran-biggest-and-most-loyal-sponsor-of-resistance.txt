TEHRAN- Iran is the “biggest and most loyal” supporter of the resistance movement in the world, according to Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who praised the great participation of Iranians in demonstrations commemorating International Quds Day on the final Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan. Qalibaf made the remarks on Sunday at the start of a plenary session of the Iranian parliament. The Iranians turned out in huge numbers in rallies to express their support for the Palestinian cause and denounce the occupying regime’s decades-long crimes against Palestinians, the senior MP stated. “The outstanding turnout of the Iranian people in the rally on Friday unequivocally is regarded as one of the most influential and magnificent Quds Days in recent years, representing the historic initiative of the great founder of the Islamic Revolution and the true model of resistance against tyranny and domination,” the speaker highlighted. The Iranian people “dazzled in a special and historic way” at this year’s Quds Day rallies, the top lawmaker remarked, adding the rallies shook the Zionist enemy’s back across the whole nation. “Islamic Iran today, with the support of this vigilant and wise nation and under the tutelage of the visionary Leader of the Islamic Revolution, is the biggest and most steadfast supporter of the resistance around the world,” Qalibaf pointed out. More than 40 years ago, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late founder of the Islamic Republic, declared the final Friday of the holy month of Ramadan as Quds Day. The demonstrations take place all across the world to support the Palestinian people’s struggle for the liberation of their occupied territories and their resistance to Israel. The yearly gathering, which is regarded as the pinnacle of Muslims’ vigilance against Israeli atrocities, provides freedom-seekers anywhere in the globe, regardless of creed, with a platform to express their solidarity for the Palestinian cause and their outrage at the occupying regime. Muslims observed Quds Day this year amid outrage over Israel’s recent round of incursions on Palestinian worshipers at the al-Aqsa mosque complex. “Iran main backer of resistance” Sheikh Naim Qassem, the deputy secretary general of Hezbollah, said that Tehran has always been in the forefront in supporting the resistance front in the region despite suffering consequences for adopting such an approach. He made the comments on Saturday during a ceremony honoring International Quds Day at the Iranian embassy in Beirut. “The Islamic Republic of Iran is leading an axis of resistance that has spread throughout the region,” he said, adding, “It has become a force to be reckoned with whereas Palestine remains as its centerpiece.” Qassem also underlined that the resistance trajectory is now more effective than ever since it has imposed deterrence equations, saying that Hezbollah knows no bounds when it comes to opposing the occupying Israeli regime. Al-Quds, according to him, holds the key to releasing the whole region from the grasp of world oppression and arrogance. He noted that “we must seize the opportunity to work toward the emancipation of the Palestinian people since the trends we are witnessing signal significant changes in the region.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
