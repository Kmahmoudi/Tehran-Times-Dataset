TEHRAN - A U.S.-owned media purportedly has said that certain cities of Ukraine have been targeted by the Iranian UAVs. With the conflict of Russia and Ukraine lingering, a new chapter of war of words has emerged in cahoots with American machinations. They pinned the blame on Iran for allegedly selling weapons to Russia!  A Ukrainian intelligence officer showed CNN the wreckage of a downed drone which was used by Russians in a spate of attacks against Ukrainian cities.     To shed light on the veracity of news, it is enough to say that how it is possible a precision-guided gear has been the work of a bungling amateur! The snapshot shows a botched-up label on a UAV which says “launched.” It is by no means clear that Iran plays a pivotal role in supplying Russia with a myriad of weapons including UAVs.  Iranian officials have invariably refuted such a sham allegation, stressing that Tehran has always favored peaceful sentiments in rift between Russia and Ukraine.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
