Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an open session of the parliament here on Sunday, Kazem Jalali said that during the meeting the commission chairman Alaoddin Boroujerdi first briefed the leader about the performance and concerns of the Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission at both the national and international levels, and then the commission members raised their view points about the different issues. He further expressed hope that his commission could move in compliance with the guidelines the Supreme Leader had presented during the meeting. Representative of Shahroud at the Islamic Consultative Assembly said that the issues discussed during the meeting pertained to domestic security, border security, armed forces, Iran's neighbors, foreign policy and nuclear energy, hoping that the session could have paved the ground for the positive and proper performance of the commission. Asked about the Supreme Leader's evaluation of the commission performance, he said that Ayatollah Khamenei had pointed to the nuclear energy-related approvals of the parliament as among the best ratifications of the Islamic Consultative Assembly in the post-revolution era, reminding that the said approvals have been presented to the parliament by the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission.
