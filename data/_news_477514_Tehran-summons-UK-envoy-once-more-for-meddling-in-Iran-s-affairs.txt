TEHRAN - For the third time in recent months, the Iranian Foreign Ministry has summoned Simon Shercliff, the British ambassador in Tehran, in relation to the UK's meddling in Iranian domestic matters and its fresh sanctions on Tehran. In a meeting with the British envoy, the director general of Western Europe at the Foreign Ministry expressed the Islamic Republic's fervent opposition to Britain's meddling in Iraâ€™s domestic affairs. The British ambassador was informed that Tehran views the "arbitrary sanctions" imposed by London and its underlying assumptions as undesirable and useless. The Islamic Republic reserves the right to retaliate against any additional sanctions imposed by the UK due to alleged violations of human rights, the ministry official said. This came after the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office announced earlier on Monday that sanctions had been placed on Iran's "morality police" as a whole, as well as its chief Mohammad Rostami Cheshmeh Gachi and the head of the Tehran Division Ahmad Mirzaei, for their alleged roles in putting an end to recent riots in the country following the death of Mahsa Amini. The FCDO reports that London additionally sanctioned five top Iranian political and security figures after alleging that they had gravely violated human rights during the 2019 Iranian protests. The blacklisting will restrict the people from entering the UK and will lead their assets to be frozen. Amini, a 22-year-old woman, fainted at a police station on September 13 and pronounced dead three days later at a hospital in Tehran. Her death sparked protests first in her home province of Kurdistan and then spread to several other cities, including the country's capital Tehran. Amini's death was thoroughly pursued by President Ebrahim Raisi shortly after she passed away, and a formal report issued on Friday said that she had died of a disease rather than from rumored blows to her skull or other important body parts. After rowdy rioters killed police officers and destroyed public property in many places, what had first been peaceful demonstrations became violent. The United States Treasury Department also on Thursday announced sanctions on seven Iranian officials under the allegation for supporting the shutdown of the internet and repressing protests over the death of Amini. Nasser Kanaani, the spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, criticized the latest round of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic, asserting that the limitations constitute the "backbone" of the purported American human rights laws. On Sunday, the head of the Iranian Army also declared that the country's armed forces will not tolerate any foreign meddling or violence. All branches of the Iranian Armed Forces assist one another and serve as the country's first line of defense in safeguarding national security and staving off threats, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi stated.
