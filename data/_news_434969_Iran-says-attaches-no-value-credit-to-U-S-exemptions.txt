TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Monday that Iran does not attach any value or credit to the United States’ exemptions on Iranian oil exports. “Due to the illegality of the specified sanctions, the Islamic Republic of Iran has not attached any value or credit to the exemptions on sanctions and will not do so,” Mousavi said, Mehr reported. He added that Iran is in constant contact with its partners to hamper the impacts of U.S. sanctions.   Earlier, the U.S announced that it is not extending any waivers exempting importers of Iranian oil from U.S. sanctions and there will be no grace period for those economies to comply.
