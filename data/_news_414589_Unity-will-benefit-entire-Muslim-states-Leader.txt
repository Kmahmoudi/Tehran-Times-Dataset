The Leader described the Quds Day rallies as an example of Islamic unity to be proud of, saying, “This is the very meaning of Islamic unity, in which fasting Shia people pour into the streets with such glory and greatness to voice their solidarity and sympathy for the Palestinians, who are Sunnis.”    Pointing to the occupation of the Muslim country of Palestine and the expulsion of its native inhabitants, the Leader, said, “According to Islamic jurisprudence, once faced with the domination of the enemy over Islamic territory, all Muslims are duty-bound to campaign and carry out jihad in whatever possible form and, therefore, fighting against the Zionist regime is incumbent upon and mandatory for the entire Islamic world.”  Criticizing some Muslim countries for turning down this campaign, the Leader described the Iranian nation as vigilant and conscious in carrying out their duty. “The Muslim world needs unity… and Muslim nations are overwhelmingly in sympathy with each other and it is their governments that must fulfill their responsibilities.”   ‘Valuable social assets’ Addressing the Eid-al Fitr worshippers on the same day at the Mosallah Mosque in Tehran, Leader also praised the IRGC’s powerful missile strikes on ISIL in Syria as well as the massive rallies on Quds Day and huge turnout in the May 19 presidential elections, saying these are all “valuable social assets” which are the source of honor and hope. On June 18, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps fired six surface-to surface missiles at Islamic State targets in Syria in retaliation for the terrorist group’s deadly attacks in Tehran. The missiles were launched from Iran’s western bases at ISIL command centers, logistic sites and suicide car bomb factories in Syria’s eastern Deir al Zour area.
