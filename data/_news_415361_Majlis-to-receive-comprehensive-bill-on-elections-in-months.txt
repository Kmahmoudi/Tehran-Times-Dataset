TEHRAN â€“ A comprehensive bill on elections is expected to go to the Majlis floor in the month of Aban (October 23-November 21), the head of Majlis Committee on Councils said on Sunday.

 Asqar Salimi told Tasnim that the bill had been referred to the government for corrections shortly after the May 19 presidential election, but the government failed to return it within a one-month deadline because it is busy with the future cabinet makeup. He added the government has already passed 140 articles of the bill and will hand it down to the committee in days.
