TEHRAN - A delegation from Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation will arrive in Tehran in December to continue talks on selling MRJ 100 (Mitsubishi Regional Jet) aircrafts to Iran, Iran’s deputy transport minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said on Saturday.
 “We offered purchasing 20 aircrafts under a finance lease agreement,” IRNA quoted Fakhrieh-Kashan as saying. The Japanese side is to announce its final decision in this regard after studying our offer in the second joint working group which is going to be formed in Tehran in December, he explained. “Aseman Airline would be an appropriate choice for buying the MRJ 100 aircrafts,” he added. As reported earlier, the unit of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries began market surveys into Iran last September, four months before the U.S. lifted sanctions. The Japanese company has been touching base with flag carrier Iran Air and Aseman Airlines, as well as the country's aviation authorities. Mitsubishi Aircraft is partnering with the Japanese government in this endeavor, aiming to make use of state-backed financing. Because Mitsubishi Aircraft is developing the 90-seat model first, the company plans to deliver the 70-seater in 2019 at the earliest. Because of economic sanctions, Iran had been unable to replace aging aircraft. Tehran is planning to expand its airports and transform the city into a Mideast hub.  HJ/MA
