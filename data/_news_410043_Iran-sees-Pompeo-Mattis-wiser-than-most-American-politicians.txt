TEHRAN – The secretary of Iran’s Expediency Council has said Iran is not concerned about Donald Trump’s picks to lead the Pentagon and CIA, as they are “wiser than most American politicians.” “Mike Pompeo and James Mattis, the famous American generals who are going to lead the CIA and Defense Department respectively, are two of the most important and sensitive faces among Trump’s cabinet picks,” said Mohsen Rezaei in an Instagram post on Friday. “Although their remarks have harsh and exaggerated faces of reality, it seems they possess a better political wisdom compared to many American politicians, and given the realities, they would avoid illusions and daydreams,” he added. The former IRGC chief noted that the Islamic Republic is well aware of the two generals’ records as well as their understanding and knowledge base. “They, too, are aware of our capabilities,” he said, adding, “They perfectly understand that Iran is a ‘patient lion’ as well as an ‘alert tiger’ and that they should not get close to it.” Rezaei also predicted that a “critical period” lies ahead between Tehran and Washington during Trump’s tenure. Trump has repeatedly criticized the nuclear deal – officially known as the JCPOA – that loosened sanctions on the country in exchange for curbing certain aspects of its nuclear program. Donald Trump’s pick for defense secretary, retired General James “Mad Dog” Mattis, said Thursday at his confirmation hearing that he supports the deal even if it is flawed. MH/PA
