TEHRAN -- The history of Iran and the history of Silk Road are intertwined, Iran’s tourism chief Masoud Soltanifar said Saturday during the opening ceremony of the 6th Silk Road Task Force Meeting of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Representatives from 33 member countries are participating in the three-day event, which is being held in the northwestern city of Urmia. The UNWTO Silk Road Program is a collaborative initiative designed to enhance sustainable tourism development along the historic Silk Road route. It aims to maximize the benefits of tourism development for local Silk Road communities, while stimulating investment and promoting the conservation of the route’s natural and cultural heritage. The Silk Road is not only a commercial route but also a cultural and touristic one, Soltanifar said. Sharing information and mutual cooperation between Silk Road countries would be a great help to solve international problems in the region, he added. “Iran as an important spot in cultural, art and economic exchanges along the Silk Road can have an influential role in boosting economic ties and improving tourism relations among member countries,” he said. He called the meeting a great opportunity, which would boost peace between countries.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
