TEHRAN – Sculptures of Gate of All Nations and Hafez Mausoleum, two iconic symbols of tourism in Iran, will be showcased at the country’s pavilion at the 39th FITUR tourism trade fair in Madrid, Spain, from January 23 to 27. The monumental sculptures will be built based on the moulage technique, which is assumed to improve realism by the means of special modeling and casting techniques, CHTN reported. Iran’s pavilion will be running by the Touring & Automobile Club of the Islamic Republic of Iran (TACI) under the auspices of the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts, and Tourism Organization.  Live performances of regional music, craft workshops, public meetings, as well as exhibits of handicrafts, souvenirs and handmade clothing are among programs TACI has on agenda. Iran’s pavilion will cover an area of 357 square meters, which is 53 square meters bigger than that of the previous edition. In 2018, FITUR beat the participation record with 10,190 exhibiting companies from 165 countries/regions, 140,120 trade participants and 110,860 people from the general public. The attendance of 7,856 journalists is a turnout that shows the importance of FITUR on the international circuit of tourism industry events.
