Robert Lucien Jean-Claude Kargougou, the health minister of Burkina Faso, called for cooperation with Iran in the field of health. He said his country was seeking to import Iranian medical equipment. “We are ready for any kind of cooperation with Iran and we request to benefit from Iran's experiences in addition to importing types of medicine, medical equipment, and vaccines,” Kargougou said. He made the remarks in a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Bahram Einollahi in Tehran. “We visited the capacities of Iran’s health sector and we admire Iran for its progress and self-sufficiency in the field of health, especially for the production of 97 percent of the needed medicine inside the country.” “Iran excels in the field of health and has advanced hospitals, so we welcome the development of cooperation with Iran,” he highlighted. “The coronavirus disease has been controlled to some extent in our country, but there are still cases of infection, and with the vaccines donated by Iran, we can have a wider vaccination coverage to contain the disease.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
