TEHRAN- According to the speaker of the Iranian parliament, collaboration between Iran and Iraq, two significant and distinctive regional nations, can increase commerce and also enhancing regional security. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf made the remarks in a meeting with the visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Shia' Sabbar al-Sudani and his entourage on Tuesday night. Ghalibaf congratulated al-Sudani for taking over as Iraq’s prime minister and expressed hope that his visit to Iran would help deepen ties. “Such meetings will bring closer the Iranian and Iraqi nations because Iran and Iraq are two neighboring countries with deep religious, economic, and cultural ties,” the parliament speaker remarked, added, “Iran's people and government want to support an Iraq that is prosperous and advanced because doing so will make Iran proud.”  Ghalibaf went on to say that “Iran and Iraq, among Arab and Islamic nations, may without a doubt serve as the best example for broad and deep collaboration.”  “Of course,” he said, “the Zionist regime and the United States are both opposed to such extensive bilateral cooperation.” For his part, al-Sudani praised Ghalibaf for his congratulations to him on assuming leadership in Iraq, saying, “I and my accompanying delegation were both hoping to have a meeting with your good self.”  He added since Tehran and Baghdad enjoy close ties, his visit to Iran is a great opportunity to cement ties.  He added that it is “our responsibility” to strengthen ties.
