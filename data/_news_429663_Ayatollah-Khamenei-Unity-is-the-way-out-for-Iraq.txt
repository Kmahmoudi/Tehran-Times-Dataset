TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a meeting with Iraqi President Barham Salih in Tehran on Saturday, said that unity among Iraqis is the way for the country to triumph over enemies.
 “The only way to fight [enemies’] schemes is to preserve and boost unity among Iraqi groups, including Arabs, Kurds, Shias, and Sunnis,” Ayatollah Khamenei asserted. “Some states, inside and outside the region, hold deep grudges against Islam, the Shia, the Sunni, and Iraq. They interfere with the internal affairs of Iraq that should be resiliently withstood.” Leader: I deeply believe in cementing ties with Iraq  
The Leader also stressed bilateral relations with Iraq. “The Islamic Republic’s officials are very serious and determined on expanding ties with Iraq. I, too, deeply believe in it.” “A dear, powerful, independent, and developed Iraq would be very beneficial to Iran and we will stand by our Iraqi brothers,” he noted. He also pointed to the victories of the Popular Mobilization Forces (Hashd al-Sha’abi) against terrorism in Iraq and stressed the need to preserve the forces. Elsewhere in his remarks, the Leader pointed to the Arbaeen pilgrimage to Karbala, saying the hearts of Iranians are full of gratitude to Iraqis for their hospitality during the event.
