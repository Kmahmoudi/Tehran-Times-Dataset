TEHRAN – Es’haq Al-e-Habib, the Iranian deputy ambassador to the UN, has said that economic sanctions are impediment to sustainable development and violate the people’s right to progress.
 Speaking at the UN Commission for Social Development (CSocD) on Thursday, Al-e-Habib also said instability leads to growth of poverty in the world. The Iranian envoy said that instability and bloody clashes, especially in the Middle East region, have caused an exacerbation of poverty. Al-e-Habib said that positive steps have been taken at the international level to counter poverty, however, there are a large number of people in the world who are living in extreme poverty. “The importance of fighting poverty in the sphere of social development should not become a tool to exert political pressure,” he remarked. He also said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to follow and implement policies focusing on the eradication of poverty and deprivation through adoption of multiple approaches with a view to the specific nature, urgency, and severity of each situation of poverty.” The 56th session of the UN Commission for Social Development started work at the United Nations headquarters in New York on January 29. The session will run until February 7 with a focus on eradicating poverty for achieving sustainable development goals for all. NA/PA
