Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), on Thursday sent a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei praising Iran’s stance on Jerusalem al-Quds.
 On December 6 U.S. President Donald Trump declared that he recognizes al-Quds as the capital of Israel and ordered the relocation of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds. “All the enduring people of Palestine appreciate the Islamic Republic's standing and worthy positions in regards to Palestine, Quds, and support of the Palestinian people’s resistance with different types of aid,” Haniyeh wrote, according khamenei.ir. Pointing to the dimensions of a major conspiracy led by global arrogance against Quds and the Palestinian people, which is aimed at overthrowing Gaza as a fortress of resistance in order to end the struggle against the usurper regime while normalizing ties between dependent regional rulers and the Zionists regime, Haniyeh appreciated the support of the Iranian people and the guidance of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in favor of the resistance movement. “With the onset of a massive Intifada in the West Bank and Quds, we will, with God’s grace, neutralize the conspiracy of today’s tyrant (Trump) and the hypocritical rulers in the far and near capitals who seek to end the Palestinian cause,” the Hamas official remarked. He said that the conspiracy of recognizing al-Quds as the capital of Israel was aimed at destroying the basis of resistance. “Although these conspiracies were clear to us since long ago, they have become more apparent than before, in recent months and days, with the Riyadh conference and the words of Donald Trump in which he called Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas their ‘prepared enemies’, and emphasized his Zionist attitude by labeling Quds as the ‘Jewish capital’.”  He also noted, “I strongly believe in the role your Excellency exercises, directing the Islamic Republic and its devout commanders in a direction to carry out the project of accomplishing the goals of Palestine, and also in your statements for mobilizing the Ummah, warning them to avoid the abyss towards which the people are misled by the rulers of hypocrisy and conspiracy.” Noting that Iran has been on the side of Palestine in difficult situations, he appreciated Iran’s performance in supporting the resistance movement.  “With great guidance of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Iran, undoubtedly, has had and will have a great privilege in strengthening the Mujahideen (fighters) and reinforcing the option of resistance and struggle in Palestine.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
