TEHRAN – Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan has said reimposing sanctions against Iran by Washington is a “big mistake”, and that the era of U.S. totalitarianism in the world is over. Farrakhan made the remarks in a meeting with Mohsen Rezaee, secretary of the Expediency Council, in Tehran on Sunday. “Christians say the devil is a liar and they count Trump’s lies every day,” he stated, ILNA reported.  “Only the devil has been created with lies,” he added. Pointing to the long history of U.S. conspiracies against the Islamic Republic, he said, “I understand what plots the enemies have hatched against the Iranian nation and I am willing to stand by you to thwart their plots.” Rezaee, for his part, called on Islamic countries to unify against the enemies. “In the war between the West and Islam, no Islamic country can emerge victories by itself … In this confrontation, the world’s Muslims should get united and create a movement to counter the West’s hegemony,” he remarked. Rezaee further urged the Iranian nation to be united in the face of U.S. hostilities. Emphasizing the oath-breaking nature of the Trump administration, he said, “Trump violated an international agreement. He continues this illegal and inhumane behavior with cruel sanctions.” “We will defeat him, and by the grace of God, Mr. Trump will come back from these sanctions empty-handed,” he added. In May Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 historic nuclear agreement and ordered reinstatement of sanctions on Iran. This came despite the fact that the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has repeatedly confirmed Iran’s commitment to the nuclear agreement. ‘U.S. has never had true democracy’ Farrakhan also delivered a speech at the University of Tehran on the occasion of Aban 13, where he attached great importance to unity against the U.S. policies. He asserted that the U.S. has never had true democracy. Elsewhere, Farrakhan criticized the U.S. silence over murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi, a Saudi critic writing in the Washington Post, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.  Riyadh initially denied knowledge of Khashoggi’s fate, claiming that he had left the consulate. However, later Saudis admitted that he was killed in the consulate. Istanbul’s chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, issued a statement on Wednesday announcing that the body of Khashoggi was dismembered after he was strangled as soon as he entered the consulate.
