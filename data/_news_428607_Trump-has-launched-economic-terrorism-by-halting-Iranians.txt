TEHRAN –Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Monday that the Donald Trump administration has launched “economic terrorism” by preventing Iranians’ access to medicine, calling the move “inhumane”.
 “The U.S. has sanctioned us, because of our independence and freedom, sanctions which are inhumane and contrary to principles of human rights. It [the U.S.] even prevents the people from accessing medicine and basic needs by resorting to economic terrorism,” he said during a speech at the 4th ICMM Pan-Asia Pacific Congress on Military Medicine in Tehran. On October 3 the United Nations' top court ordered the United States to lift sanctions on "humanitarian" goods to Iran. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) unanimously ruled that Washington "shall remove by means of its choosing any impediments arising from the measures announced on May 8 to the free exportation to Iran of medicines and medical devices, food and agricultural commodities" as well as airplane parts. The court said sanctions on goods "required for humanitarian needs... may have a serious detrimental impact on the health and lives of individuals on the territory of Iran." ‘Iran is a peace-seeking country’ The defense chief went on to say that Iran is a “responsible” and “peace-seeking” country that is committed to principles of human rights and international obligations. However, he said, Iran is “powerful” to defend itself. The minister said the world realized that Iran was sincere in saying that its nuclear program was peaceful and it was the United States which proved it is not faithful. “During the past years, the world has witnessed Iran’s good intention… and has practiced self-restraint and patience in spite of the U.S. violations,” the minister remarked. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the multilateral 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions. The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on August 6 and the second wave of sanctions will return on November 4. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also announced in May that the U.S. will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic. The restoration of sanctions happened despite the fact that the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency has issued dozens of reports each time confirming Iran’s full commitment to the terms of the nuclear agreement. According to the nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran was obliged to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions. The JCPOA was confirmed by the UN Security Council resolution 2231, turning the agreement into an international law. ‘The world will regret for not standing against violation of international law’ Elsewhere, Hatami said that the world will finally regret not standing against violation of international law by the Trump administration. “If the nation and countries do not stand against violations of law, they will witness emergence of new Hitlers and serious human disasters,” the defense chief warned.
