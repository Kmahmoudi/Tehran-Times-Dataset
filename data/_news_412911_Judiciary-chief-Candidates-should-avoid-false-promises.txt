TEHRAN -- Iran’s judiciary chief has said that the presidential election candidates should avoid making false promises to people.

 “False promises are able to cast one out of the line of justice,” Sadeq Amoli Larijani said on Tuesday, adding that another highly important thing for the candidates to consider is to avoid slanders and damaging each other’s reputation, Fars reported. “Some sorts of criticism is okay, but criticism should not verge on undermining or insult.” SP/PA
