TEHRAN – The Union of Islamic Students Associations in Europe has released a statement in support of the Bahraini and Palestinian people and condemned the massacre of the Yemeni people by a Saudi-led coalition. In the statement, the union pledged support for all oppressed people across the world and said it will spare no efforts in confronting the oppressors, Fars reported on Monday. The union also thanked Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Leader of the Islamic Revolution, for his support. The union is steadfast in its allegiance to the path of Imam Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei, and will use all its energy to progress in this endeavor, it concluded. The statement came after Ayatollah Khamenei issued a message to participants attending the 52nd conference of the union. “The current era and its developments define certain expectations for young individuals, which did not exist or were not known in previous times,” the Leader’s message read. “Young university students should, thoroughly, understand these developments and the corresponding expectations, and thus prepare themselves,” it said. “Islamic associations and the religious climate within them can assist you in preparing yourselves. The main point is that you work for the sake of God, enthusiastically, fulfilling your duties. If you accomplish the blessed opportunity [to do so], Divine Guidance will come to your aid, too. God willing.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
