TEHRAN – Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan said on Monday Iran regards security of the Middle East region as its own security.
 “We regard the security of the region as our own security, and insecurity and crisis in the region influence other’s security,” he said during a ceremony held in Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. He also said imperialism has always sought to form a united front and undermine security and stability in the Mideast region to achieve its objectives.  “Today, the U.S. and Israel don’t care what happens in the region. The enemy adjusts its plans to the situation,” he said. Dehqan called the emergence of the Takfiri movement in Iraq and Syria a creation of the U.S. and the Israeli regime. “The Takfiri-terrorist movement which has been created by the U.S., the Zionists, reactionary Arabs and even some countries like Turkey does not limit its actions to Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq. It is a comprehensive issue which threatens the whole international security,” he stated. The Iranian official said that fighting the Takfiri movement is a “humane, sublime goal,” noting that Iran is at the forefront of fighting terrorism and extremism. “This a fact that an international front has been formed against the Islamic world and unfortunately, it is accompanied by the reactionary governments in the world of Islam.” He expressed regret over the fact that the countries that promised to support the issue of Palestine are moving in line with Israel’s benefits. He added that imperialism and the Zionists make any effort to maintain the current situation. “Islamic countries have human capacities that can be used against the Zionists, but they are being used against the Islamic countries,” he said.
