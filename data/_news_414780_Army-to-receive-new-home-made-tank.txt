TEHRAN – The Iranian Army is going to receive the state-of-the-art, homegrown tank dubbed “Karrar” soon, according to Army Ground Force Commander Brigadier General Kiomars Heidari.

 Speaking to Tasnim on Monday, Heidari said the tanks will be delivered by the end of the current Iranian year (March 20, 2018). “The Karrar tank is a very good, ideal and operational tank that has been tested and used in war games,” he said.        Karrar enjoys modern technologies. Its earlier version is already in service, together with other locally-made tanks like Zolfaqar. SP/PA
