TEHRAN – More than 50 million foreign passengers have flown over Iran during the previous Persian year, says Brigadier General Farzad Esmaili, the commander of Iran’s Air Defense Force. Boasting Iranian airway’s security in a region filled with conflicts, Esmaili said more than 1400 foreign passenger planes fly over the country each day. “The safest and most important airway in the Middle East is that of our beloved country,” he said, stressing that this is despite all the threats and unjust sanctions against Iran by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
