TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Monday described the personality of the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump as “unpredictable” and said speculations regarding his foreign policy would be “premature”.  “Speculations about Mr. Trump’s foreign policy would be premature judgments because of his [contradicting] stances,” Qassemi said during a press conference on Monday. He noted that time will make it possible to judge the foreign policy of Trump. Qassemi also reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to a nuclear deal – also known as BARJAM or JCPOA – that was reached by Iran and six world powers including Russia, China, the U.S, France, Britain, and Germany. “Iran has on various occasions stated that it will remain committed to the agreement unless the other parties concerned wish to choose another path,” he asserted. The official added Iran has predicted various scenarios and drawn up different strategies in case the other parties violate the nuclear deal. “BARJAM is a multilateral agreement and it’s not so easy for one party to take measures without considering other parties’ viewpoints,” Qassemi said in reference to what he described as “some Zionist sources” who claim Trump wants to make changes to the nuclear deal.  “These issues should not be taken seriously,” he said, accusing the Zionists of orchestrating anti-Iran propaganda during the nuclear negotiations and afterwards. Elsewhere in his remarks, Qassemi talked about the Syrian crisis and the role that regional countries could play in it.  “Iran, Russia and Turkey will hold trilateral talks in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the Syrian crisis.”  He added, “It is natural for the [three] countries to have different views on some issues. Even two countries cannot have the exact same stances on all issues.” He further said that Iran and Turkey had some difference on the Syrian crisis. “However, this has not prevented consultations between the two countries.” “The foreign ministers of the two countries have talked on the phone several times during the past couple of days, and the Syrian issue has been one of the pivotal issues in these talks,” he said.
