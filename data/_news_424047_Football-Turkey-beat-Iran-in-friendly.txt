TEHRAN – Turkey national football team defeated Iran 2-1 in a friendly match thanks to Cenk Tosun brace Monday night. Just six minutes into the match, the Everton forward dribbled past Team Melli defender Rouzbeh Cheshmi and found the back of the net with a powerful shot from inside the area at the Basaksehir Fatih Terim Stadium. Alireza Jahanbakhsh provided a good chance for Ehsan Haji Safi in the 24th minute but his attempt was saved by Turkey goalkeeper. Tosun scored once again finding the back of the net from outside the box in the 50th minute. Turkey’s Omer Bayram was sent after touching the ball in the penalty area in the injury time and substitute Ashkan Dejagah pulled a goal back from the penalty spot. The warm-up was as part of preparation for the 2018 World Cup, where Iran have been drawn in Group B along with Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The Iran national football team will open the campaign with a match against Morocco at Saint Petersburg on June 15. Team Melli, meanwhile, face Spain in Kazan on 20 June before meeting Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in Saransk five days later.
