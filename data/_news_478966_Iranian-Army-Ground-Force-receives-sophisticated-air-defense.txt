TEHRAN- Brigadier General Kioumars Heydari, the commander of the Iranian Army Ground Force, announced on Monday that his unit has received a sophisticated and smart air defense system that was produced by the nation's military specialists and technicians. In an exclusive interview with the Fars news agency on Monday, Heydari emphasized how crucial it is for the Ground Force units to have cutting-edge weapons in order to increase their effectiveness and be able to meet operational demands of the moment. He continued by pointing out that the Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei has already received three grandiose ideas from the Army Ground Force, known as Labbaik (Allegiance) 1, 2, and 3. The first plan, known as Labbaik 1, aims to reorganize the military's organization and mobilization in order to better position the armed forces to crush the opposition in close-quarters ground combat. The senior Iranian general emphasized that Labbaik 1's objectives included the creation of mobile offensive and fast reaction units, adding that work is still being done to tailor the plan's cyber, missile, and drone components to meet contemporary operational requirements. Heydari emphasized that the main goal of the Labbaik 2 plan is to equip the Army Ground Force with weapons that have the four characteristics of long-range, precision-strike, intelligence, and network connectivity. He stated that the homegrown weapons being developed under the plan should be able to strike the enemy's forces' minimum operational depths, which Iran has set at 300 kilometers, have precision-strike capabilities because future wars would prioritize effectiveness over destruction, be smart enough to devastate a strategic target once fired, and seamlessly connect to the intended network. Heydari also stated that the Ground Force has acquired the country's first smart air defense system, which is equipped with cutting-edge technical capabilities. He noted that all Iranian-developed unmanned aerial vehicles are sophisticated, intelligent, and precision-guided and added, "Our drone unit has been formed with multiple extremely vast regional bases." The 155mm artillery units' optimization work has been finished, according to the commander of the Ground Force chief, and work on upgrading additional units is now under progress. Heydari said that the Labbaik 3 plan places a strong emphasis on engineering, particularly the development of barracks, hospitals, and other institutional structures. Iranian military specialists and engineers have achieved great advances in manufacturing a wide range of indigenous weaponry in recent years, allowing the armed services to become self-sufficient. Iranian officials have frequently emphasized that the nation would never negotiate on its defense capabilities and that it will not hesitate to bolster its military might, particularly its missile capability, which is only intended for defense. Ayatollah Khamenei has consistently urged actions to preserve and improve Iran's military capabilities, criticizing adversaries for raising doubts about the nation's missile program.
