TEHRAN – Iran’s Supreme Court has confirmed death sentence against billionaire businessman Babak Zanjani, Gholamreza Ansari, an official with the court, said on Saturday. Ansari added the Supreme Court has overturned death penalty on British-Iranian national Mahdi Shams and Hamid Fallah Heravi, two of Zanjani’s business associates, ILNA reported on Saturday. Zanjani was sentenced to death last April for corruption, but he appealed the ruling. Zanjani had been accused of money laundering as well as massive fraud in some dealings with the Oil Ministry.  SP/PA
