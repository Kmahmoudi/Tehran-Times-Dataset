Reyshahri, who arrived in Medina yesterday, further told the Iranian pilgrims, "Considering the late Imam's advice that the solution to all problems facing the Islamic nations is unity, the Iranian pilgrims should make Hajj a manifestation of solidarity and unity among all Muslim nations." He pointed to the fact that the current year has been designated as the Year of Imam Ali (AS), and that the Imam (AS) was the strongest supporter of Islamic unity following the demise of the holy prophet (S). The Leader's representative further said, "Iranian pilgrims are the followers of Imam Ali (AS). Therefore, they should try to promote Islamic unity."
