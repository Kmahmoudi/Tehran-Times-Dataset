TEHRAN – German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has said that his country along with other European powers will fight for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, to keep it alive, even without the U.S.
 Maas told German newspaper Passauer Neue Presse in an interview on Wednesday that Donald Trump’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran is a “mistake”, warning about the isolation of the country that could lead to a “chaos”. “Nobody is saying the deal was perfect, but it is definitely better than having no deal at all,” Foreign Minister Maas notes.“We still consider it a mistake to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Iran… Germany and the EU will fight to keep the deal alive, even without the USA,” the senior diplomat stated. “Nobody is saying the deal was perfect, but it is definitely better than having no deal at all.” “We will fight for it because it is in our interest in terms of security that there is security and transparency in the (Middle East),” the foreign minister said. He underlined that stability in the region is of high importance for Europe.   Maas also attacked those in the West who were pinning their hopes on regime change in Iran, warning that this could lead to “even bigger problems.”  AFM/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
