 As four decades have passed since the Islamic Revolution, the youth have realized that resolving the country’s current problems necessitates a campaign against anti-revolution thoughts and return to the pure basics of the revolution, reads the letter. The letter came in anticipation of the Ninth Dey (December 29) mass rallies in Tehran in 2009 which put an end to about six months of unrests that ensued the presidential election in the same year.  SP/PA
