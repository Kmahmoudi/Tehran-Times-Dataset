TEHRAN- Loading and unloading of commodities at Shahid Rajaee Port in Iran’s southern Hormozgan Province rose five percent during the first four months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-June 21) compared to the same period of time in the past year.
 Some 27.908 million tons of commodities were loaded and unloaded at Shahid Rajaee Port during the four-month period, IRNA reported on Sunday quoting Allah-Morad Afifipour, the managing director of Hormozgan Province’s Ports and Maritime Department. The official said the commodities include 18.694 million tons of non-oil products and 9.213 million tons of oil products. Last month, Afifipour had said that tens of projects worth 30 trillion rials (about $799 million) are underway at Shahid Rajaee Port. Among these projects, he referred to establishment of three oil terminals as well as access roads at the value of 600 billion rials (about $15.9 million). Having the docks constructed within the next two years, Shahid Rajaee’s capacity of oil products exports will increase up to 34 million tons. Iran plans to increase the capacity of its ports to reach 250 million tons by four years, IRNA reported in late June quoting the Head of Iran's Ports and Maritime Organization (PMO) Mohammad Saeidnejad as saying. The official said that the country’s ports are currently operating at a capacity of 210 million tons. EF/MA
