TEHRAN – Iran has denounced the United States for repeated accusations against Iran while its own weapons have “ended up in the hands of ISIS.” “On the very day U.S. regurgitates Saudi & Emirati propaganda on #Yemen, #CAR report confirms US & Saudi weapons end up in the hands of ISIS. With this U.S. administration, it seems hypocrisy knows no bounds,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Friday. Earlier in the day, Reuters quoted an arms monitoring group as saying that arms provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia to Syrian opposition groups frequently ended up in the hands of ISIS militants. Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said most ISIS weapons were looted from the Iraqi and Syrian armies. But some were originally provided by other countries, mainly the United States and Saudi Arabia, to Syrian opposition groups fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
