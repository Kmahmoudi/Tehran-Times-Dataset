TEHRAN -- The winners of the first Qeshm Island bloggers’ travel writing festival will be announced on April 29, which marks Iran’s Persian Gulf National Day. The Persian Gulf island of Qeshm will host the festival from April 25 to 29. “We do believe that bloggers can boost Iran’s tourism activities a lot. Such festivals will be held in other countries like Germany, Switzerland, Thailand, and South Korea as well,” President of Iran Federation of Tourist Guide Associations Arash Nooraghayee said in a press conference on Saturday. “Qeshm will host tourism startup in October and the first sustainable ecotourism seminar in the future as well,” he said. The sponsors will provide budget for bloggers to visit different parts of Qeshm and write reports about the places, he explained. The event is co-organized by Iran Federation of Tourist Guide Associations and Qeshm Free Zone Organization. About 50 bloggers applied for the festival and 28 ones were selected to travel to Qeshm. Bloggers will visit Qeshm, Hengam and Hormuz islands during their three-day sojourn. Nooraghayee along with travel writer Masnour Zabetian and tourism photographer Asad Naqshbandian will be the festival’s jury members. Qeshm is the biggest Iranian island in the Persian Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
