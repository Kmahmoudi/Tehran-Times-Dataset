TEHRAN – The volume of petrochemical products produced by Iranian complexes rose by seven percent to reach 23 million tons in the first 5.5 months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-September 5), Shana reported on Monday. Iran’s National Petrochemical Company (NPC) director for production control, Ali-Mohammad Bossaqzadeh, told Shana that the mentioned volume is the total output of 47 petrochemical complexes across the country, of which the output of 29 complexes has risen compared to the past year. “Considering the fact that the first six months of the year is the period for overhaul in most petrochemical complexes, the increase in output is outstanding,” he said. The board member of the National Petrochemical Company said it is expected that in the second half of the current year along with increase in production, the target levels for sales and exports will also be reached. In NPC’s latest report released in September 10, the total volume of petrochemicals output for the first five months of current Iranian calendar year (March 20-August 21) was reported 21.238 million tons. This figure has reached 23 million tons by mid Shahrivar (the sixth Iranian calendar month which started on August 22). Petrochemical products comprised the largest portion of Iran’s non-oil exports during the first five month of the current Iranian calendar year. According to Mohammad-Hassan Peyvandi, the previous deputy managing director of NPC, Iran plans to raise its petrochemical production to over 180 million tons in a course of ten years.
