The two assailants were also gunned dowm. On Wednesday, U.S. forces opened fire on a vehicle whose occupants "drew a weapon and pointed it at" U.S. troops in a Humvee all-terrain vehicle who were heading to their training area north of Kuwait City. Fifteen Kuwaitis were arrested in connection with the Failaka attack and were referred to the public prosecution. Interior Minister Mohammad Khaled al-Sabah said the suspects -- all Kuwaitis -- formed an "organization" that was planning to strike at five other U.S. and foreign targets. A team from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is currently in the emirate following up on the attack and probing possible security lapses.
