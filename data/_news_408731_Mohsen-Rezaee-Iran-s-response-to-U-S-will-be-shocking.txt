TEHRAN – The secretary of Iran’s Expediency Council has said if the U.S. extends sanctions on Iran, the Islamic Republic’s response will be “shocking”.

 Writing on Instagram on Friday, Mohsen Rezaee said the new sanctions will not concern only Iran, but will be a mockery of Europe, China, and Russia. “It will be a disregard for the UN Security Council. Therefore, we will be free to act against America. But our action will be more fundamental and more crushing,” the former IRGC chief remarked. SP/PA
