Teymouri replaced Mohammad Khayatian who assumed the position, as a caretaker manager, in September. Earlier this month, CHHTO Director Ali-Asghar Mounesan, who doubles as vice president, estimated that international arrivals in the country will be reaching seven million during the current Iranian calendar year (to be ended on March 20, 2019).
