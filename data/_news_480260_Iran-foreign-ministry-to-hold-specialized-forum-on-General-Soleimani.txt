The ceremony will be held at the Grand Mosalla Mosque of Tehran on January 3. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Moqadamfar said the ceremony will include various programs including grassroots campaigns aimed at commemorating the assassination of General Soleimani.  The programs include recitation of the Holy Quran, reading of General Soleimani’s will, book donation, performing religious prayers, and media activities, he explained.  Moqadamfar also said the word “soul-sacrificing” has been chosen as the motto for the ceremony.  “Haj Qassem Soleimani sought to elevate the Islamic revolution and considered Iran a shrine. He considered Iran to be the owner of the holy shrines and he believed that if Iran is damaged, many holy shrines will be damaged,” Moqadamfar said, according to Mehr News. He added, “He is always alive. He is a national hero and a hero of the Islamic Ummah and will remain a hero. He has forever become a role model for free-thinking people.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
