A total of 150 stalls have been set up for the event, of which 120 are dedicated to crafters and artisans, 20 to tour operators and travel agents, and 10 to traders of local souvenirs, IRNA reported. Currently, 52 fields of handicrafts such as kilim carpets, traditional locks, and giveh shoes -- a traditional, lightweight footwear -- are practiced across the province, the report said. The sales exhibit will be running through October 4, featuring arrays of personal ornamentation, woodwork, illuminated manuscript, miniature, textile printing, enamel, leatherwork, handwoven textile, calligraphy, traditional musical instrument, metalwork, and marquetry to name a few.
