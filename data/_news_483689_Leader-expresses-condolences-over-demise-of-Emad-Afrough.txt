TEHRAN- Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei on Saturday expressed condolences over the demise of Emad Afrough. Emad Afrough, a former parliamentarian who was vocal in his criticism of his fellow principlists, died at the age of 66. His funeral ceremony was held on Saturday at the University of Tehran's Mosque.Â  Afrough passed away on Friday in hospital in Tehran due to cancer-induced problems. Afrough represented Tehran in the seventh Parliament from May 2004 to May 2008. A PhD holder in sociology, he served as chair of the Cultural Committee of the Parliament. Afrough declined to seek reelection when his tenure ended, in part due to his conflicts with the principlists. Instead, he dedicated himself to a teaching career, even though he continued to oppose the policies of his fellow conservatives.
