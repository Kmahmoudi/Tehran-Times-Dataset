TEHRAN – A conscript was martyred and another wounded in a deadly shooting in Sistan-Baluchistan province.  The two conscripts were targeted on Sunday night in the port city of Chabahar, southeast of Iran.  According to Iranian media, two gunmen shot at the conscripts who were in the line of duty. One conscript identified as Aref Hooti lost his life as a result of the shooting and the other one, Benyamin Fazeli, has been shot in the shoulder and is now receiving treatment in a local hospital. Sistan-Baluchistan province has been restive over the last few weeks as nationwide unrest engulfed Iran in the wake of the death of Mahsa Amini. Recently, a delegation from the office of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, travelled to the province to closely look into the situation.  After the trip, the delegation issued a statement on the recent incidents in the province. It is highlighted in the statement that “after accurate investigations of the recent uprisings in the region, a delegation dispatched to the strife-torn regions, conducted a survey surrounding the recent disturbances and made a final report.”  It added, “After having several meetings with high-prolife figures of the province, the final report was tendered to the Leader of Islamic Revolution.” “We came to convey the Leader’s grief over the tragedies that occurred” in the province, said Mohammad Javad Haj Ali Akbari, the head of the delegation. Haj Ali Akbari traveled to Zahedan, the provincial capital, at the behest of Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei in mid-November. He said the Leader had requested an accurate investigation into the recent incidents in the border province. He was dispatched to the province in his capacity as an envoy from the office of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
