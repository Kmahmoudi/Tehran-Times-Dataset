TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that the Zionist regime of Israel's occupation of Palestine “will not last long”. “Despite Netanyahu’s claims, the fact is that illegal occupation lies at the heart of most of the calamities in our region,” Zarif in a message posted on his official Twitter account on Tuesday. “Historically, occupying another’s land has never been sustainable. This occupation, too -- and the apartheid system that perpetuates it -- will not last long,” he added. Earlier in the day, Netanyahu claimed that Iran is seeking to dominate regional countries such as Syria and Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.
