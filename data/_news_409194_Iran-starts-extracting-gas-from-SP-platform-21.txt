TEHRAN - The gas extraction project from the phase 21 of Iran’s South Pars gas field (in the Persian Gulf) was started targeting a daily capacity of 28 million cubic meters of gas, Shana reported Thursday quoting Alireza Ebadi, the operator of South Pars phases 20 and 21 development project, as saying. The official noted that with this phase going online the total capacity of the South Pars field has increased to 515 million cubic meters per day.
The extracted sour gas will be transported to the phases 20 and 21 refinery and it will be injected to the national network after being sweetened.
The country’s Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) placed the platform of South Pars gas field’s phase 21 on its jacket in the Persian Gulf in July 2016.
South Pars gas field, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate.
