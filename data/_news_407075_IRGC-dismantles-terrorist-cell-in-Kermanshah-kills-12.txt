TEHRAN – The IRGC security forces have dismantled a terrorist cell, killing 12 militants in the western province of Kermanshah, the IRGC Ground Force commander announced on Tuesday.  Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour said on Tuesday that IRGC forces of the Najaf Ashraf base in Kermanshah and local forces have managed to dismantle the terrorist cell which had links to the opposition and terrorist groups backed by the United States and the Zionist regime. “The thugs wanted to sneak into the Islamic Republic’s borders in order to threaten the country’s security, but were identified by security and intelligence forces of the Najaf Ashraf base,” Pakpour stated. He further said that the terrorists had to engage in heavy clashes with the IRGC forces, and as a result, twelve of them were killed and the terrorist cell was fully dismantled. Pakpour praised the IRGC forces for their “decisive and timely action” and also lauded the local forces for their cooperation. The top military official announced that three IRGC forces were injured during the operation. “Significant sums of weapons and ammunition were seized from the terrorists,” he added. In a similar incident nearly two weeks ago, four members of a Kurdish terrorist cell were arrested in Western Iran. According to a report by Tasnim news agency, the terrorists had entered into Iran’s border through the country’s western borders, close to the Kurdistan Regional Government’s territory, but were arrested on September 16-17 in Marivan, Kurdistan province.
