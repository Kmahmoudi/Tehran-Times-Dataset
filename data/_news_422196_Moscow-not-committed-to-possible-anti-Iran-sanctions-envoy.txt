TEHRAN – Russia’s ambassador to Tehran Levan Dzhagaryan has said that Moscow will not be committed to possible new sanctions against Iran by European countries and the United States. The comments by the ambassador came after Britain, France and Germany, three partners to the nuclear deal, are seeking to impose sanctions on Iran for its missile program to encourage U.S. President Donald Trump to stay in the nuclear agreement. “We stress once more that Russia will not participate in talks between three European countries and the U.S. and we will not be committed to those countries’ agreements and opposes sanctions,” Dzhagaryan said in an interview with Tasnim news agency published on Sunday. He also said no one would benefit from new anti-Iran sanctions.  On Trump’s threats to withdraw from the deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the ambassador said, “If we think wisely, there’s no need to exit the nuclear deal. One who thinks he can benefit from this is wrong.”  Emphasizing that the JCPOA benefits all sides, the Russian ambassador said European countries have the same stance but have no choice.  ‘Russia condemns BBC’s intervention in Iran’s affairs’ In another interview with IRNA published on Sunday, Dzhagaryan said the BBC Persian’s programs are a blatant intervention in Iran’s internal affairs Moscow condemns such intervention, he added. He pointed to the CIA-backed coup d'etat of 1953 against then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, saying the U.S. and Britain repeatedly intervene in other countries’ internal affairs. Ambassador Dzhagaryan also expressed satisfaction with Tehran-Moscow ties, saying relations between the two countries have developed in different areas, including the political field.
