Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Abdolnaser Hemmati underlined that the U.S. designation of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as a ‘terrorist organization’ shows its failure in anti-Iran economic pressures and policies. "The U.S. administration’s recent measure against the IRGC is the last sign of failure of its policy to pressure the Iranian nation and the financial and monetary sanctions in the past year, specially the heavy defeat sustained in the first half of the month of Farvardin (March 21-April 20)," Hemmati wrote on his Instagram page on Tuesday. He added that if the U.S. was seriously confident of the success of its past policies, naturally, it would not resort to this dangerous move. "The CBI along with the government will powerfully implement its plans, including access to sustainable, safe and sanction-proof foreign currency, and such measures will not leave any durable impacts on the markets," Hemmati said. The United States on Monday designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization, marking the first time Washington has formally labelled another country's military a "terrorist group". Responding to Washington's move, Iran immediately declared the U.S. as ‘state sponsor of terrorism’ and American forces in the region ‘terrorist groups’. Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), in a statement issued on Monday evening declared the United States a ‘terrorist government’, and blacklisted the ‘CENTCOM and all its affiliates a terrorist group’. The SNSC - that is headed by President Hassan Rouhani - condemned Washington's move, calling it ‘an illegal and dangerous action’ that poses a ‘major threat to regional and international peace and security and grossly violates the rules of international law’. The statement further condemned the U.S. decision as ‘unlawful and unreasonable action’ prompted by the Islamic Republic's regional influence and success in fighting against terrorists, and blamed CENTCOM for harming Iran’s national security as well as ruining the lives of ‘innocent Iranian and non-Iranian individuals’ to promote the U.S. ‘aggressive policies’ in West Asia (the Middle-East).
