Dear driver:
We completely understand that you don’t like keep your foot on the brake, that you had a hard day, that you are in a hurry! But the point is that other drivers also share many of these things with you.  Maybe, as the citizens of big cities, we should accept driving as a necessary part of our life, like eating which may take your time, but it never makes you impatient! It would be great if you can open all the ways by keeping out hooting your car’s horn, but actually it just makes other drivers nervous! Maybe listening your favorite music or just relaxing while you are in traffic congestion is the solution. You know, we are not in a competition, it is a part of our daily life, so accept it!
