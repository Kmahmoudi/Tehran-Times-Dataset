Many of the works, which have a remarkable similarity with the paintings of Russian-born French surrealist Marc Chagall, have never been shown before. The display has been arranged according to the size of the pictures, her son told CHN at the opening ceremony. “It is hard to display works on the basis of themes and values, so we tried to group the works according to their size,” remarked Ali Bolboli. “Only a few of the large-sized works, including ‘Rooster-Rider’, have ever been displayed before. The most expensive tableau on display, which depicts two local girls, costs over 50 million rials (about $5,000), and the least expensive one costs 2 million rials (about $200),” he added. Qanbari died at the age of 77 on October 24, 2005. She was born in the village of Darikandeh near Babol in the Mazandaran Province of Iran. Last October her house was converted into a museum to house her works. Qanbari was selected as the "Female Painter of 2001" by the Swedish National Museum. The exhibit will run until April 21 at the gallery on Vali-e Asr Avenue, opposite Saei Park.
