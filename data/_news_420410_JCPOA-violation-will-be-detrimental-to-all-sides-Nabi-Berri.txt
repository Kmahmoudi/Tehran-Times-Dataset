TEHRAN – Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabi Berri said on Tuesday that a violation of the Iran nuclear deal will be detrimental to all parties, urging all the signatories to honor the clauses of the multilateral agreement. “Any violation of the nuclear deal with Iran by 5+1 countries will be harmful to all the countries,” noted Berri who had attended the Islamic unity conference in Tehran.  The veteran Lebanese politician also pointed to the U.S. decision to recognize al-Quds as the capital of Israel, saying, “Iran adopted a strong stance against the U.S. decision to move its embassy to al-Quds and announced that al-Quds is the capital of Palestine.”  MH/PA
