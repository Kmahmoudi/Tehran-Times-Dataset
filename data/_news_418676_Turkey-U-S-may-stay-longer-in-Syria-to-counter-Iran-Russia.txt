TEHRAN – Turkish president’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said on Monday that the U.S. may be planning to stay longer in Syria to counter Russian and Iranian presence. “If that's the goal, that will complicate the situation on the ground even more,” Kalin said in an interview with France24, adding that the main goal must be to protect Syria's territorial integrity. He also said that the Astana peace talks, brokered by Turkey, Russia and Iran are not meant to replace the Geneva talks. MH/PA
