TEHRAN -- Iran became one of the 14 members of the UNESCO’s Asia Pacific Geoparks Network (APGN) Advisory Committee.
 Iranian geologist and scholar Alireza Amrikazemi was named as the representative of Iran to the committee during the 5th Asia Pacific Geoparks Network Symposium, which is currently underway in the Zhijindong Cave UNESCO Global Geopark, China. “One of the main aims of geoparks is to preserve geological heritage, boost economic development of local communities, as well as attract more tourists,” Amrikazemi told ISNA on Wednesday. “I negotiated with representatives of some countries during the symposium who were eager to have mutual cooperation with Iran,” he said. The Advisory Committee comprises representatives of the founding members of the APGN in recognition of their particular experience and knowledge on geoparks together with other nominated individuals with a particular skill or knowledge in the field of geological heritage and sustainable development.
