The northeastern city of Neyshabur has been designated Iran’s Book Capital for the Iranian calendar year of 1395 (March 20, 2016-2017). TEHRAN – The northeastern city of Neyshabur has been designated Iran’s Book Capital for the Iranian calendar year of 1395 (March 20, 2016-2017). The news was announced during a ceremony held at Tehran’s Vahdat Hall on Monday attended by Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ali Jannati, First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri and Deputy Culture Minister for Cultural Affairs Seyyed Abbas Salehi. Culture Minister Jannati in his short speech promised that in the near future the World Book Capital title would be bestowed upon an Iranian city. He called the project a dynamic idea that would help attract the world’s attention to the cultural diplomacy of Iran. According to the organizers, Mellat Foundation, one of the sponsors of the project, will establish a library in Iran’s Book Capital of Neyshabur this year. Moreover, Vahdat Hall hosted the second edition of the Festival of Book Loving Villages and Nomads, which the minister regarded a significant movement in the cultural development of the country. He said that a library in a village is not only a library but also it is a center for art and cultural activities. “Each book is actually the seed of knowledge which grows in hearts of the young villagers. These small cultural activities can help create great events. We invite all non-governmental organizations to take part in book-reading promotion projects,” the minister said. Salehi also said that the festival has been established to strengthen the existing infrastructure for book reading among the villagers and the nomads.  Last year, the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz was designated Iran’s Book Capital from among ten nominations.
