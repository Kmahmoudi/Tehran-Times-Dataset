TEHRAN- Vasily Alekseyevich Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, said on Friday that the industrial and military complex of the Russian Federation is capable of fulfilling its goals without the need for outside assistance. According to Tass news agency, the envoy stated at the UN Security Council that the allegations of importing weapons from Iran are unreservedly unfounded. “They try to distract public attention to bogus allegations about the passage of armaments from Iran to Russia, but we have repeatedly denied the allegations,” Nebenzya said, adding that “Moscow will not be impacted by former Western allies.” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, claimed on Friday that Iran has become Russia’s “top military backer”.  Kirby added, "Russia's been using Iranian drones to strike energy infrastructure, depriving millions of Ukrainians of power, heat, critical services. " Iran has said that it had sold drones to Russia before the Ukraine war and that they were not intended to be used against Ukraine. Iran has also asked Ukraine to provide evidence that its drones have been used in the war. Contrary to the accusations against Iran, the West has been shipping arms to Ukraine since the war began on February 24, a move that Iran says has exacerbated the situation.  For instance, the United States has supplied Ukraine with 19.1 billion dollars in military and security aid since the outbreak of conflict.  Additionally, the Bulgarian parliament approved the supply of a military package to Ukraine on Friday. The West has also placed several sanctions on Russia and blocked its assets. Europe's sanctions against Russia's oil export have caused a major gasoline shortage and rising inflation in the European bloc.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
