TEHRAN – U.S. President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew Washington from the UN-endorsed 2015 nuclear agreement in May, said on Saturday that holding talks with Tehran is up to the Iranians.
 “Iran, and it’s [sic] economy, is going very bad, and fast! I will meet, or not meet, it doesn’t matter - it is up to them!” he tweeted. First in a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on July 30 in the White House Trump said he is ready to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without any pre-conditions. “It’s good for the country, good for them, good for us and good for the world. No preconditions. If they want to meet, I’ll meet,” Trump said. Hamid Aboutalebi, an aide to President Hassan Rouhani, said on July 31 that the U.S. would have to return to the internationally-backed nuclear deal and stop new sanctions against Iran if it wants negotiations with Tehran. “Respecting the Iranian nation's rights, reducing hostilities and returning to the nuclear deal are steps that can be taken to pave the bumpy road of talks between Iran and America,” Aboutalebi tweeted. On the same day Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Trump should try respect for the Iranians and also for the international commitments. “Iran & U.S. had 2 yrs of talks. With EU/E3+Russia+China, we produced a unique multilateral accord—the JCPOA. It’s been working. U.S. can only blame itself for pulling out & leaving the table. Threats, sanctions & PR stunts won’t work. Try respect: for Iranians & for int’l commitments,” Zarif tweeted.
