TEHRAN - The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) successfully launched Iran's first military satellite into the orbit on Wednesday.
 The first military satellite, dubbed Noor 1 [Light 1], was launched upon Ghased (Messenger) satellite carrier in the early hours of Wednesday from a location in the central desert of Iran, Sepah News reported. The satellite was placed into orbit 425 kilometers (265 miles) above the Earth’s surface. The satellite launch was carried out on the anniversary of the 41st anniversary of the establishment of the IRGC. Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit. In 2013 Iran launched a monkey into space.  IRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami said the “successful launch of the satellite promoted new dimensions of the defense power of the Islamic Republic of Iran” and called it a “strategic achievement” for the country. According to Sepah News, General Salami said the multi-purpose satellite has military applications as well. The IRGC chief congratulated this success to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and the “noble” Iranian nation. General Salami added now the IRGC enjoys the advanced space technology. In modern era powerful militaries cannot boast a comprehensive defense plan without access to space, Salami remarked. It also marks a great jump for the IRGC’s intelligence capabilities, the senior commander remarked. The multipurpose satellite is highly valuable in terms of information technology and information warfare, he explained. IRGC Aerospace Force chief: Access to space is not a choice but a necessity Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force, said access to space is unavoidable. “Today access and using space is not a choice but an unavoidable necessity and we must also find our place in the space,” Hajizadeh remarked. Pointing to the technological aspects of the satellite, which uses combined liquid and solid fuel, the commander added, “Only superpowers have this capability and others are just consumers of this technology.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
