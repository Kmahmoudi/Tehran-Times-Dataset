TEHRAN – A former Iranian diplomat has said that crushing Daesh is the only practical way to adopt in confronting the terrorist group.

 Speaking in a conference on “Iraq after Daesh” in Tehran, Sadeq Kharrazi said the basic question currently is whether recent advancements in Mosul completely annihilate Daesh or leave frozen pockets to spring up in the future. “If the governments of Iran, Iraq, or any other government care for sustainable development, there is no choice but to avoid compromising on terrorism,” he stressed.
