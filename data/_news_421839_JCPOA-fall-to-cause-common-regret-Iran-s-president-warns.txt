TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned against the consequences of a possible breakdown of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saying all parties to the deal would regret such event. Speaking in a Monday meeting with France’s Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian, Rouhani said the JCPOA is a test for all negotiating parties. “Remaining committed to the accord would prove to the world that the negotiation and diplomacy is the best way to solve problems, but the collapse of the deal means that political talks are a waste of time,” he warned. The president also stressed that all negotiating parties must adhere to their commitments under the deal, making it clear that Iran will never be the first party to violate the agreement. The Iranian president further pointed to the common views that Iran and France share on the JCPOA and their common support for the accord, saying, “Fortunately, today, via the nuclear deal a suitable environment has been created for the development of mutual relations and collaborations. We must move towards achieving the common goals and interests of the two nations in this direction.” He further referred to the historical and friendly ties between Tehran and Paris in various fields, including trade, economy, industry, agriculture, culture, transportation and energy, adding that the two governments are determined to establish and strengthen mutual friendly ties. “There are no limits for the Islamic Republic of Iran to develop and boost relations and collaborations with France,” he said, IFP reported. Pointing to the necessity of mutual cooperation between Iran and France on regional stability and security, the president said, “France and the Islamic Republic of Iran have played a positive role in resolving the recent problems in Lebanon, and should collaborate in keeping peace in this country and preparing the grounds for an election that brings about political vitality and stability in the country.” Pointing to the Yemen crisis, he added, “It is an international and humanitarian responsibility to do our best for the sake of Yemeni people who are suffering from bombardments, diseases and many (other) troubles.” He noted that these efforts must be made towards the implementation of a ceasefire, ending the war, stopping the massacre of the Yemenis, and delivery of humanitarian aid. Referring to Syria’s crisis, Rouhani said Iran has been helping Syria in the fight against terrorism at the request of Damascus, but noted that terrorism has not been fully eradicated in the Arab country. “There is no way but to strengthen the central government in Damascus to resolve the Syrian crisis.” For his part, Le Drian emphasized his country’s respect for the JCPOA and Paris’s interest in maintaining the nuclear deal. “The IAEA reports indicate that the Islamic Republic is fully committed to its obligations, and France will do its utmost to preserve the nuclear agreement,” the French diplomat said. “We are interested in the development and boosting of relations in all fields with the Islamic Republic of Iran. To this end, France has considered some ways to facilitate the expansion of mutual economic cooperation in order to boost the trade dynamism established between the two countries,” Le Drian added. “Iran and France can work together to promote regional stability and security, in particular to prevent humanitarian catastrophes in the region and to solve regional crises,” he noted. Earlier in the day, Le Drian held separate meetings with the Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.
