TEHRAN – All infrastructures and cultural and religious conditions are provided for Iranian women’s presence at stadiums, said Masoud Soltanifar, minister for Sports and Youth Affairs. Since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21, 2018) coordination has been made for women’s presence in some international events and now all infrastructures are provided for women to enter the stadiums from separate entrance gates, ISNA quoted Soltanifar as saying. Before the victory of Islamic Revolution (1979), women participated only in seven sports international events, but now women are active in 49 international fields, noted the minister. Currently, Iranian women are permitted to spectate a friendly match between Iran’s women’s football team and Russia’s in a women-only crowd at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran. The timing of the match is not out yet, although the sports ministry’s officials have given the green light to the women for attending the match. In November, around 500 women were permitted to join the 80,000 crowd attending the second leg of the Asia Champions League final in the capital between Persepolis and Japan’s Kashima Antlers.
