TEHRAN – The Iranian economy is not affected by “a foreign official’s remarks,” the vice president for economic affairs said on Wednesday as President Trump is expected to announce U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal within days. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Mohammad Nahavandian said Iran’s economic relations with the world develops day by day and the U.S. government’s “foolish, unconsidered remarks” could not change that. He stressed that Iran’s supporters are more than that of America, adding that the U.S. is isolated for its hostile stance against the Iran nuclear deal.
