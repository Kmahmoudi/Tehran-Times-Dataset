Marking the second anniversary of the historic agreement aimed at ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has commended the Persian Gulf country for implementing its nuclear-related commitments.
 Two years ago, Iran and the so-called 'E3+3' or 'P5+1' – composed of China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States – reached an agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was endorsed by the Security Council. “The JCPOA was a major achievement in the area of nuclear non-proliferation,” said Mr. Guterres in his statement issued overnight. “It gives us all hope that the most complex issues in this domain can be addressed through dialogue, understanding and cooperation,” he added. He welcomed the recent recommitment expressed by the JCPOA stakeholders on 25 April to the full and effective implementation of the plan, and called on them to continue to work together in good faith and reciprocity. “Their sustained commitment is essential for the long-term viability and success of the agreement,” he said, calling on all member states to support further pursuit of this historic agreement and pledging that he will do the same. “It is in the interest of the international community that this achievement of multilateral diplomacy endures transitions and implementation challenges cementing our collective commitment to diplomacy and dialogue,” he stressed.
