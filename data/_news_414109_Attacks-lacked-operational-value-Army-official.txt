TEHRAN – The Wednesday terrorist attacks in Tehran lacked operational quality and value, the Iranian Army’s second in command said on Friday.

 Daesh was trying to engage Iran at a large scale since 2012, Ground Force chief Ahmad Reza Pourdastan said, Nasim reported. He said the terrorist attacks were the result of billions of dollars spent by “arrogant countries” to launch some militarily and operationally significant act, but they clearly failed, the Ground Force commander underlined.
