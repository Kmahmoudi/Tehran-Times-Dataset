TEHRAN — Iran has allocated 55 trillion rials (nearly $1.4 billion) for improving technical and vocational education and training, the deputy labor minister said on Tuesday.  Unfortunately, jobseekers don’t usually qualify for many jobs as they have not been well-trained at schools or universities, Abolhassan Firouzabadi said, adding, the educational curriculum needs to be altered to prepare students for their future jobs. Firouzabadi further expressed hope that within the next three years technical and vocational education and training would be compulsory at schools.  “Sadly we only provide students with one-sided education while students need vocational training as well,” he highlighted.  Technical and vocational education and training helps learners acquire skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to develop professional careers and enter the world of work, creating a vibrant labor market and contributing to economic growth.
