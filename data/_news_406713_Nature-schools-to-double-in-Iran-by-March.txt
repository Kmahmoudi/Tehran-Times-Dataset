TEHRAN — Nature schools in Iran will be doubled by the end of the current Iranian calendar year, falling on March 20, an official with the Department of Environment has said. “So far 20 nature schools are up and running in the cities of Tehran, Rasht, Mashhad, Tabriz, Kermanshah, Hamedan, and some other cities, and we are planning on increasing them to 40, twice as many as the current number by the end of the year,” Mohammad Darvish said, ISNA news agency reported on Sunday. “We have to bring up a generation who will not trade on natural resources and that would happen in nature schools,” Darvish said, adding, “These schools can also create job opportunities for the experts in the field of environment.” Nature school is not interfering with the normal school operating under Education Ministry’s supervision, rather it is a place for the children to spend their free time and enjoy environmental activities there with their parents.
