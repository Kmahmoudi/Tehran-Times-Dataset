TEHRAN – In response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatening tweet against Iran, former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Mohsen Rezaei hit back soon, warning Trump to be “cautious”. “Mr. Trump has told Mr. Rouhani to be cautious,” Mohsen Rezaei tweeted on Monday, hours after Trump warned Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to be cautious or “you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.” Rezaei told Trump, “When more than fifty thousand of your forces are under Iran’s sword, it’s you who need to be cautious but instead you make demented threats.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
