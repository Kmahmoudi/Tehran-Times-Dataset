TEHRAN – The National Museum of Iran has put on show a rarely-seen collection of its treasure trove in a month-long exhibit that opened to the public on Wednesday. Some 80 percent of the total 252 exhibited objects have never been displayed before and the rest are rarely-seen, IRIB quoted the museum’s director Jebreil Nokandeh as saying on May 17. The objects date from the Paleolithic era to the end of Qajar period (1789–1925), he added. The exhibit features prehistoric tools, pottery vessels, metal objects, textile remains, and some rare books and coins amongst others. The event is devoted to mark the National Cultural Heritage Week, which has already commenced in the country and the International Museum Day that is celebrated on May 18.
