TEHRAN – Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani on Wednesday denounced Washington’s “vicious” behavior towards the Islamic Republic, calling on the lawmakers to take countermeasures in unison. Pointing to the U.S. lack of commitment to the nuclear agreement, Larijani said parliamentarians should be informed about breaches of the deal, also known as the JCPOA. The remarks came weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump refused to certify the JCPOA, punting the issue to Congress with a threat to withdraw the U.S. from the deal if new sanctions are not imposed on Tehran.
