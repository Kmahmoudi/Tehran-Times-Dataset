TEHRAN – “The recent EU resolution on Iran has many problems,” Iran’s human rights chief said on Wednesday. 

 “The European Union is not entitled to tell us we have to mend ourselves,” said Mohammad Javad Larijani.  He also said the Islamic Republic will not authorize the European Union to open an office in Tehran, Fars reported. Such an office will be a “house of corruption, and the Judiciary will not allow such a thing,” Larijani stressed. SP/PA
