In a meeting with the participants in a Tehran conference titled “The Admirers of the [Prophet Mohammad’s] Household and the Issue of Takfiris”, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said unity and rapport in the Muslim community in the current circumstances are among the critical imperatives and added, “The Islamic Republic of Iran is standing and will continue to stand against the plot by the hegemonic and Zionist front to create war and conflict among Muslims and, with the blessing of God Almighty, will emerge victorious in this battle just as the malignant tree of Daesh was cut down in Iraq and Syria.      

 The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated, “Although Daesh reached its end in Iraq and Syria, we should not neglect the deceit and duplicity of enemies, because America and Zionism and their stooges will not give up enmity toward Islam and they might hatch and execute a plot like Daesh and such in another region.” Stressing that we cannot afford to ignore the enemy and we must be vigilant and cautious, Ayatollah Khamenei added, “One of the requirements of this awareness is kindness and camaraderie in the Muslim community, and the prerequisite for this kindness is countering any element that is openly hostile to the world of Islam or helps the enemies of Islam.”  He cited love for the Prophet’s Household as one of the suitable grounds for forging unity and rapport among Muslims and said, “The most important duty of the admirers of the Household in various countries is raising Muslims’ awareness concerning the realities of the world of Islam and the creation of the spirit of vigilance and awareness in the face of plots to sow discord within the Muslim community.”   The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said Muslims in various countries are a reality imposed upon the hegemonic and heretic front and reiterated, “The world of Islam can stand up to hegemony and heresy today and the Islamic establishment in Iran, which seeks the full realization of Islamic rule, will be the means for victory over the enemies of Islam.” Ayatollah Khamenei pointed to around 40 years of conspiracy, pressure and sanctions by America and Zionism against the Islamic establishment and said, “Despite all this pressure, the Islamic Republic of Iran, by the grace of God, has had dramatic progress and is standing against the hegemonic front with absolute power and strength and we openly declare that the Islamic Republic of Iran will help out wherever there is need for participation to counter hegemony and heresy and we have no consideration for anyone in expressing this issue.”   The Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the issue of Palestine as the foremost issue of the world of Islam and added, “The key to overcoming the enemies of Islam is the issue of Palestine, because the heretic, hegemonic and Zionist front has, through the expropriation of the Islamic state of Palestine, turned into a base to disrupt the security of regional countries, and the cancerous tumor of Israel must be confronted.”   Ayatollah Khamenei said by sowing discord and conflict among Muslims, the enemies mainly aim to create a safety margin for the Zionist regime and said, “We hope that a day comes when the Palestinian people will become the owners of their own land and that day will be the day of celebration and festivity in the world of Islam.”   He reiterated, “The day that Palestine is returned to Palestinians, hegemony will suffer a real blow in the back and we will strive for that day to come.”  Prior to the remarks by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ali Akbar Velayati, the secretary general of the World Assembly of Islamic Awakening, said the motto of the “The Admirers of the [Prophet Mohammad’s] Household and the Issue of Takfiris” conference is “Love for the Household, the promise of unity and revival of Islamic civilization” and said, “The enemies of Islam have in recent years been seeking to neutralize the effects and results of the Islamic Awakening through the two strategies of ‘sowing sectarian discord’ and ‘[promoting] Islamophobia’.”
