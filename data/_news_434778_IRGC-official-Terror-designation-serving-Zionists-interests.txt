TEHRAN – The United States’ designation of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as terrorist is to serve the interests of the Zionist regime of Israel, the IRGC representative for parliamentary affairs has said.

 The move is yet another act by Washington to ensure the survival of Israel, Mohammad Saleh Jokar said, adding it followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s March 25 recognition of the Golan Heights under the authority of Israel. Jokar added the terrorist designation was also meant to influence elections in Israel. He went on to assert that “Today, many people around the world admit the fact that it is only the Guards which can stand up against terrorist groups such as Daesh, which are supported by America, the Saudis, the Emirates and some others.” Earlier, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had described Trump’s move to blacklist the Guards as another “misguided” election gift to the Israeli prime minister on the eve of parliamentary elections. “A(nother) misguided election-eve gift to Netanyahu. A(nother) dangerous US misadventure in the region,” Zarif tweeted. Israelis headed to the polls on April 9 to elect the 120 members of the 21st Knesset (parliament). On the eve of the vote, Netanyahu took credit for Trump’s decision to blacklist IRGC. “Thank you, my dear friend, President Donald Trump,” Netanyahu tweeted in Hebrew, “for answering another one of my important requests.” SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
