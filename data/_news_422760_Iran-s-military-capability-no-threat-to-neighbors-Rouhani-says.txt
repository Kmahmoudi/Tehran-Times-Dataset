TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that the Iranian military’s defense capabilities are for deterrent and pose no threat against the neighboring countries.
 “We seek to have friendly and brotherly ties with our neighbors and tell them that our weapon, missile, airplane and tanks are not against them and are for deterrence,” Rouhani said during a ceremony marking Army Day. He noted that “deterrence” and “powerful defense capability” form the cornerstone of Iran’s defense policies. “No one should be worried about Iran’s power, however, we tell the major powers not to make the region full of gunpowder and various weapons to serve their own interests and gain dollars from the Arab countries,” he stated. He added, “Your weapons cannot bring independence to regional countries and nor cause fear for great nations such as Iran. Do not loot the regional Muslims’ money to expand your weapons factories.” Rouhani went on to say that crises in the region should be settled through “politically talks” and “peaceful behavior”. He added Iran will continue strengthening its military power and its armed forces are ready to defend the country under any circumstances. In an indirect reference to Iran’s help to Iraq and Syria in their fight against terrorists, Rouhani said the Iranian military has helped establish regional security. Today Iran and its armed forces are more influential at the international stage than ever, he said. He also said the Iranian military commanders, like the political officials, have never been after tension and they have been seeking peace and stability in the region. The Iranian president went on to say that regional countries should not rely on foreign powers for their own security. “The countries which rely on their domestic forces feel powerful while artificial power cannot bring a country glory. So, the regional countries should not seek power from the major powers or an illegitimate regime in the region,” the president remarked.
