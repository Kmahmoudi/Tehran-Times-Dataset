TEHRAN - The decisive victory of Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the recent presidential elections and the change of Turkish political system have brought the country into a new era in the national and international arena. Given the increasing power and prerogatives of the presidency in the modern Turkish political system, it is expected that Turkey will succeed in establishing a kind of stability in domestic and regional politics and will play a more effective role in different areas. In an interview with Mehr News agency, Haghi Uighur, vice director of the Center for Iranian Studies in Ankara, Turkey's position in the new era has been examined. Following is the full text of interview: Q: Some polling organizations in Turkey believe that the presidential election will be dragged into the second round. How do you evaluate the decisive victory of Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the first round? A: Many polling organizations predict that President Erdogan will gain over 50% of the votes in the first round. I had personally said in various television programs that Erdogan is expected to gain about 52 percent of the votes. There is no reason for surprises, because many Turkish polling organizations, naturally miscalculate the result. However, we are talking about 2 or 3 percent margin of error. Q: How would Tehran-Ankara ties change as Turkey enters a new era? A: The relationship between Iran and Turkey, enjoying a kind of permanent stability, are actually independent of the ruling powers of these two states. That's why we cannot expect a particular change in this area. But given that Iran, as one of the main suppliers of energy resources in Turkey, is an important economic partner for Ankara, any pressure on Iran by Trump will have a ripple effect on Turkey too. Q: How will the results of the recent presidential elections affect Turkey's policies towards Syria? A: I don’t think there will be too many changes in Turkey’s policy on Syria. This issue has long been disappeared from a regional matter and has developed into a global problem that can only be solved with the participation of the United States and Russia. Border security and PKK disarmament are considered priorities for Ankara with respect to the Syrian issue. Q: Considering that Erdogan's Recep Tayyip is in a more powerful position than the past, how do you assess Turkey's relations with the European Union as well as the United States? A: In my opinion, we will see some kind of flexibility in Turkey's relations with the West, because without any doubt, the existing differences won’t be in the interest of any of the parties. On the other hand, due to greater problems in the region, it is expected that the parties will resolve their small differences. Q: How will the election outcome affect Turkey’s economy at the national and international levels? A: The results of the elections will certainly stabilize Turkey’s domestic affairs, and consequently its global position.With promises made, we expect a rate of 7.4 percent economic growth.
