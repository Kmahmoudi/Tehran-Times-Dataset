BRUSSELS (Xinhua)-- The European Unionâ€™s measures to preserve the landmark Iran nuclear deal are motivated by security interests rather than economic interests, the bloc's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told reporters on Monday. She made the remarks at a press conference following the EU's monthly Foreign Affairs Council. Regarding the EU's economic commitments to Iran, she said: "For us, it is not about economic interest; this is about security interests for the EU." "Because in the absence of the deal with Iran, we believe the security of the region and the EU will be at stake," she said. "We see no possible ways to have better security conditions in the region if the agreement is not in place any longer," she stressed.
