Larijani explained to the German delegation the legislation procedures in Iran, the balance between the Parliament (Majlis), Guardian Council, and Expediency Council as well as the process of approving laws and their administration in the Islamic Republic. "The liberal democracy in the West is open to criticism and scrutiny," he said referring to the differences between liberal democracy and religious democracy. Saying that in liberal democracies, opposition to the freedom of speech and conscience is executed through various means, he added, "In a liberal democracy, if someone insults sanctities such as God and prophets, he or she will not face any problem." The German parliamentary delegation welcomed judicial negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the European Union saying that revival of public prosecutor courts, formation of arbitration councils, and juvenile courts in Iran's Judiciary system are in compliance with the country's judicial development. The delegation also expressed Berlin's readiness for promotion of judicial cooperation with Tehran.
