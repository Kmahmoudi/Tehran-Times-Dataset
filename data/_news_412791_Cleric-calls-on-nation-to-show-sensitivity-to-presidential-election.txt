TEHRAN – Tehran’s interim Friday prayer preacher Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Movahedi Kermani called on the Iranian nation to show more sensitivity toward the May 19 presidential election which he called “a difficult exam.”  “We have a difficult exam ahead, a rugged gorge on Ordibehesht 29 (May 19),” he said, adding, “The nation have to be sensitive toward the elections.” 
The clergyman also called for a massive turnout in the elections, a move that indicates a “mighty establishment” and “popular backing.”  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
