In a brief interview with the IRIB, Seung-Ho said the embassy as well as Korean companies hail holding such exhibits as a move to familiarize their nation with Iranian handicrafts, arts, and traditions.  The ambassador expressed his willingness for broadening and deepening ties and friendship between Seoul and Tehran as well, adding “Iranian handicrafts and handwoven carpets are well known across the world.” Namvar-Motlaq, for his part, raised the concept of handicrafts and machine-made products, calling them rather supplements than contrasts, as to the fact that they may contribute side by side to enliven variety of manufactures, IRNA reported on Sunday. Namvar-Motlaq also indicated the CHTHO readiness to hold same exhibits in one of South Korean cities as well as other spots in Iran. Earlier this month, an exhibit of Iranian handicrafts with focus on woodworks was held in the city of Isfahan under the auspices of the South Koran Embassy.
