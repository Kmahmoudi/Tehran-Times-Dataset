TEHRAN- Representatives of Boeing Company will travel to Tehran within the next few days to explore the avenues of cooperation with the Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran Air) as well other Iranian airlines, the IRNA news agency reported.  During the trip, Boeing officials are slated to visit the senior managers of Iran Air and other Iranian airlines, discussing the possible aviation logistic services that Boeing could offer to Iran’s existing plane fleet, among other issues. Transport and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi said in February that Boeing has been invited to Iran after United States gave a green light to the company to resume its activates in the Islamic Republic. Western imposed sanctions which barred Iran from buying western aircrafts, was lifted in January after the two sides reached an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. According to Akhoundi, Iran is seeking to modernize as soon as possible its ageing passenger plane fleet, which has been badly hit by sanctions over the past few years. The minister said Iran currently has just 150 operational planes out of a fleet of more than 250.
