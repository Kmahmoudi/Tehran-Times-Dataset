TEHRAN – Pictures from exquisite artworks dating back to Qajar era (1796-1925) are currently on display at the Tehran National Garden, a historical compound in central Tehran. The exhibition of selective artworks is being held on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the establishment of Iran Bastan Museum and Malek National Library and Museum, Mehr reported on Tuesday. Photos taken from clay, stone and glass artworks as well as calligraphy, Persian painting as well as coins are on display during the showcase. The brick building of Iran Bastan Museum was designed by French architect André Godard in the early 20th century, and was influenced by Sassanian (224-651 A.D.) vaults, particularly the Taq Kasra at Ctesiphon.  Malek National Library and Museum is the first private museum of Iran and one of the six large libraries holding exquisite manuscripts.  SB/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
