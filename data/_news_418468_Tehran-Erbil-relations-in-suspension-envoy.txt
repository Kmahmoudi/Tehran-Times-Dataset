TEHRAN – The Iraqi Kurdistan envoy to Iran, Nazem Dabaq, said on Monday that relations between Tehran and the Kurdistan region are in suspension. Dabaq said relations would be improved after a possible agreement between Erbil and Baghdad, Tasnim news agency reported. Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government held an independence referendum on September 25 after its president Masoud Barzani turned a cold shoulder to international calls against the vote. Following the vote, which was described as unconstitutional by the Iraqi central government, Iran severed its ties with Kurdistan.
