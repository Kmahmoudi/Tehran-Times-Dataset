TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday separately received credentials of the new ambassadors of Lebanon, New Zealand, Estonia, Nepal and Latvia. In the meeting with new Lebanese Ambassador to Tehran Hassan Abbas, Rouhani said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue its supports for the [Lebanese] government and nation to resist against terrorist groups and the aggressive measures adopted by the Zionist regime.”  Rouhani expressed the hope that the recent elections in Lebanon would further strengthen unity in Lebanon, lead to economic flourishing of the country and bolster the Tehran-Beirut relations. ‘History will judge U.S. moves as deeply wrong’ In his meeting with Hamish MacMaster, the new ambassador of New Zealand, Rouhani railed against U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal as well as its embassy relocation to al-Quds (Jerusalem). “History will judge that these decisions of the American government have been deeply wrong and incorrect with regard to Iran and people of the region,” he stressed. He also pointed to the good potentials for expansion of ties between Iran and New Zealand, saying such capacities should be used to deepen ties in different fields. ‘Europeans must stand against Washington’s unwise act’  Speaking with Estonian Ambassador-at-Large Marin Mottus, the president pointed to friendly ties with Estonia, saying the Islamic Republic is ready for an all-round expansion of ties with that country. Elsewhere, he said it is necessary that the European countries resist against Washington’s “unwise act” in walking out of the international nuclear agreement, saying Iran will remain in the nuclear pact, officially called the JCPOA, only if its full benefits are guaranteed. ‘Non-Aligned states duty bound to denounce atrocities against Palestinians’  In a meeting with Nepal’s Ambassador-at-Large Sewa Lamsal Adhikari, Rouhani said all countries, especially the Non-Aligned states, have the duty to voice their decisive stance against Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians. “We have always supported the cause of the Palestinian people and will continue to do so,” he added. Rouhani calls for co-op between Latvian-Iranian private sectors  The president also met with Latvian Ambassador-at-Large Peteris Karlis Elferts. The two sides called for expansion of ties in different fields. Rouhani underscored the importance of cooperation between the private sectors of the two sides to take the best use of the potentials and opportunities for further development of ties.
