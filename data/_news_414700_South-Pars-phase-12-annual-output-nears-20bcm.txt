TEHRAN- Some 19.865 billion cubic meters of gas was produced in phase 12 – the biggest phase - of Iran’s South Pars gas field during the past Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20). As Mohammad-Mehdi Hashemi, the operator of this phase said, phase 12 also produced about 100,000 tons of sulfur in the past year, ILNA reported on Saturday. Phase 12, which is the largest development phase of South Pars gas field in terms of operation, investment and production, has the capacity of producing 75 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d) of sweet gas, 120,000 barrels per day of gas condensate and 400 tons per day of sulfur. The phase, which was inaugurated in March 2015, is located in southeast part of South Pars gas field and covers a 206 square kilometers area. The field, shared by Iran and Qatar in the Persian Gulf, contains a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate. The Qatari part is called North Dome. The field is divided into 24 standard phases. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment. MA/MG
