TEHRAN – Iranian security and intelligence officers on Monday and Tuesday killed four and arrested six members of a Daesh-affiliated network in the western province Kermanshah, Kermanshah governor said on Tuesday. They were planning suicide bombings in central parts of the country, IRNA quoted Assadollah Razani as saying.
 
“A Daesh-affiliated terrorist team which had penetrated into the borders to conduct operations in central parts of the county was busted on Monday and Tuesday in one of Kermanshah’s neighborhoods and another city of the province,” Razani stated. Located in western Iran, Kermanshah province has border crossings with Iraq. 
Iran shares upwards of 1400 km borders with Iraq, the longest compared to other neighboring countries.  Security forces had swooped on the hideout of the terrorists on Monday night, killing three and seizing suicide-bomber vests, grenades, and rifles, according to the provincial official. Locals could hear rounds being fired, the governor said. During another clash with members of the same network, one more was killed and six were arrested.  “During a second clash, one key member of the cell was killed and some were arrested.”  The news was also confirmed by Brigadier General Manouchehr Amanollahi, the provincial police chief.  Other officials including Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi, Hossein Zolfaghari, the deputy interior minister for security issues, and Mojtaba Maleki, Kermanshah prosecutor general, confirmed that four were killed. They put the number of arrestees at six.
"As a result of the operations, four of the terrorists were killed, dozens arrested, and a huge amount of explosive material, equipment, ... seized," said Alavi.   “One of the members killed in the clashes had already been spotted who was a high-ranking figure of the Takfiri current in Iraq,” Zolfaghari said.  Western and eastern borders of Iran have been a hotbed for terrorist activities, mainly influenced by weak border monitoring of neighboring countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Every so often Iranian forces bust terrorists groups in the regions, while losing forces, keeping a vigilant eye on its mainland. In June, the Iranian Intelligence Ministry announced it had thwarted several planned bombings in Tehran and other cities, following extensive intelligence operations across the country, which borders Iraq to its west.  The country’s intelligence officers have already proven themselves, preventing terrorist blasts in the country, while its vast borders are surrounded by terrorist teams. This is while terrorist groups have conducted operations in almost all regional countries, including Turkey and Lebanon. Even European counties have not been safe from terrorist attack. AK/PA
