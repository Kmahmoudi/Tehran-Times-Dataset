TEHRAN – The first water ambulance in Iran was launched in the southern province of Hormozgan on Saturday with Health Minister Hassan Qazizadeh Hashemi in attendance, Tasnim reported. Costing nearly 33 billion rials (around $750,000) the water ambulance is bought with the contributions made by benefactors active in the health sector and equipped by Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences. Some 3.73 billion rials (nearly $77,000) was spent to equip the aforesaid water ambulance.  The ambulance is equipped with 4 beds and intensive care unit (ICU). Three more high-tech water ambulances are being bought from European countries and will be added to the sector by the next year (March 21), the minister said on the sidelines of the event.  He expressed hope that importing these ambulances can be a start for their domestic production. Calling for more support for marine ambulances, Qazizadeh Hashemi highlighted that air medical services are also needed since water ambulances cannot provide services during sea storms. As far as medical manpower is concerned, Hormozgan Province is 30 percent below standards, he added. “Iran has 17 islands, 14 of which are situated in the beautiful Hormozgan Province,” said the minister, adding that medical services in these areas should be improved. Concurrently, 20 ambulances entered the medical fleet of the province. MAH/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
