TEHRAN – The general outlines of the national budget bill will be put to vote once again. It will take place after the Majlis joint committee prepares a report on the bill, Mohammad Hossein Fargani, a member of the Majlis presiding board, said on Monday.  The committee spokesman as well as three proponents and three opponents of the budget bill will address the parliament before the vote, Fars reported. After the parliament on Sunday rejected the general outlines of the national budget bill for the next Iranian fiscal year, the presiding board held a meeting to discuss the process of putting the budget bill up to vote once again.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
