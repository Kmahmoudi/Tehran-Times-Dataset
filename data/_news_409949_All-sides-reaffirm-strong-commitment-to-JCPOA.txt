All signatories to the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, reaffirmed their strong commitment to a “continued” and “effective” implementation of the deal, the Joint Commission of the JCPOA said in a press release.
 The press release followed as diplomats from Iran and great powers met in Vienna on Tuesday to assess Iran’s protest to the renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act by the United States.  Iran maintains the extension of the ISA act, which dates back to the 1996, is a violation of the internationally agreed nuclear accord. Following is the full text of the press release published on the EU website: The Joint Commission, composed of the E3/EU+3 and Iran, was chaired, on behalf of EU High Representative Federica Mogherini, by EEAS Secretary General Helga Schmid and was attended at the level of Deputy Foreign Ministers/Political Directors.  The Joint Commission meeting was specifically convened in response to the concerns raised in the letter Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif addressed to High Representative Mogherini, as coordinator of the Joint Commission, on 16 December 2016. Upon Iran's request, the Joint Commission meeting was preceded by a Sanctions Working Group meeting which was attended at the level of experts. All sides reaffirmed their strong commitment to continued full and effective implementation of the JCPOA. The Joint Commission underscored the sanctions lifting commitments contained in the JCPOA, in particular as they relate to the Iran Sanctions Act, and recognised the United States' assurance that extension of the Iran Sanctions Act does not affect in any way the sanctions lifting Iran receives under the deal or the ability of companies to do business in Iran consistent with the JCPOA. The Joint Commission also reiterated the commitments by the participants to the continued lifting of sanctions, in particular under paragraph 21 of the JCPOA. The Joint Commission meeting also offered an opportunity to review the implementation of the JCPOA as far as nuclear related issues are concerned. NA/PA
