TEHRAN - In the holy month of Ramadan, a campaign entitled "Our Iftar Will Be in Al-Quds" has been organized in Palestine Square located in downtown Tehran. Before the beginning of the month of Ramadan, graffiti of Lebanese artists on the barrier wall built by the Israelis became the first recorded images of this campaign on social media that soon became viral among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Last week, hundreds of Palestinians had their Iftar meal at Al-Aqsa courtyards, while the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas had called for wide participation of the Palestinians at communal prayers and religious ceremonies at the holy site. Now, people set the Iftar table in Tehran in the hope of the day when occupied Al-Quds will be free and prayers will be held in Al-Aqsa Mosque. And spread the Iftar table in that holy place. “As a Palestinian who lives in Iran, I feel that this work gives me strength and this does not only include me, but also all Palestinians who live inside the occupied territories or outside of Palestine,” a Palestinian student in Tehran told Al-Alam News Network. “This campaign gives Palestinians the feeling that the issue of Palestine is still alive and has a place in the hearts and minds of all the world.” The ceremony includes various programs, including cultural events and songs about occupied Palestine, and all the fasting people are invited to take part. The important purpose of holding this ceremony is to support the Palestinian nation against the pains and pressures that they suffer as a result of the aggressive actions of the Israeli occupying forces. “Our purpose of holding this ceremony, in Palestine Square and near the Palestinian Embassy, is to declare our solidarity with the Palestinian people who are facing the crimes of the Zionist regime today, so that they know that we are with them until the liberation of Quds,” one of the organizers said. Words such as oppression, resistance, defense, and protection of the homeland have undoubtedly no boundaries. This issue makes the Islamic nation stand together in support of the Palestinian people, and this is the best reason for holding this ceremony. This Iftar table is held in the holy month of Ramadan and near the Palestinian embassy in Tehran to call for support for the Palestinian cause. Everyone hopes that the blessed Iftar table will spread in the Al-Aqsa Mosque after the liberation of the holy city. World Quds Day coincides with the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan. It was designated as Quds Day on 7 August 1979 on the initiative of Imam Khomeini (May his soul rest in peace) to support the Palestinian cause and nation and mark a new stage of solidarity with the people of Palestine.
