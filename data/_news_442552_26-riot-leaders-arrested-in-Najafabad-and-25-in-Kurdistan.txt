General Ali Azadi, commander of the Kurdistan police force, also said 25 persons who were the main leaders of riots were arrested in the cities of Marivan and Sanandaj.

In a statement, the ministry said the individuals were identified and arrested while trying to set fire to public and private property in order to intensify the unrest. Protests erupted in some cities in Iran against increasing gasoline price. In certain cases, the protests turned violent as some rioters clashed with police, using knives and guns.
