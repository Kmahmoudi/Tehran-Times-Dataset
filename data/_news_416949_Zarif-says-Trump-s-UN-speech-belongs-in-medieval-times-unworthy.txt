TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that U.S. President Donald Trump’s “hate speech” at the UN General Assembly “belongs in medieval times”.
 “Trump’s ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times-not the 21st Century UN -. Fake empathy for Iranians fools no one,” he tweeted on Tuesday. In his speech, Trump said that the 2015 nuclear deal signed by Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council was an embarrassment and hinted that he may not recertify the agreement when it comes up for a mid-October deadline. “We cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,” Reuters quoted him as saying.  French President Emmanuel Macron defended the nuclear deal in his speech, warning “renouncing it would be a grave error”.
