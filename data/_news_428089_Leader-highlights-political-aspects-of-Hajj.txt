TEHRAN – The Leader of the Islamic revolution in a Monday meeting with Hajj officials highlighted the political aspects of the Muslim pilgrimage, stressing that “Islamic truths and objectives” should be emphasized during the annual ritual.

 “The Abrahamic Hajj, that is, the post-Islamic Revolution Hajj, is different from the Hajj before, and the Hajj of the countries that have inherited nothing of the tenets of Islam and the Islamic revolution,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei emphasized. Laying grounds for stronger relations with other Islamic countries and “brotherly coexistence of Islamic sects” were among the major topics mentioned by the Leader. Elsewhere in his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei criticized the Saudi rulers for destroying historical relics associated with Prophet Mohammad (PBUH), Ali ibn abi Talib (S), and other early Islamic figures, urging the Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization to cooperate efforts with other Islamic countries to prevent the House of Saud’s destructive operations.
