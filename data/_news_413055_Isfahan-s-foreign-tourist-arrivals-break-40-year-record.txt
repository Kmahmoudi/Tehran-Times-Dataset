TEHRAN – Some 85 thousand foreign travelers visited Isfahan during the first Iranian month of Farvardin (Mar. 21 to Apr. 20), setting a new record for the past 40 years, Isfahan Governor General says. The figure has jumped by about 800 percent in comparison to the same period last year, IRNA quoted Rasoul Zargarpour as saying on Sunday. The historical city received some 65 thousand overseas travelers throughout the Iranian calendar year 1392 (March 2013–March 2014), the official said, adding that currently 39 hotels are under construction across Isfahan province to bolster its hospitality industry. The surge sprang a surprise by the fact that majority of tour operators advise prospective foreign visitors to avoid visiting Iran during Noruz holidays in Farvardin when hotels are dominated by domestic holidaymakers. The government has put in a great deal of effort to revive tourism and hospitality businesses since President Hassan Rouhani assumed office in August 2013. Eelier this month, Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization Deputy Director Morteza Rahmani-Movahhed announced a total of 19.9 million travelers visited the country during the four-year period. Isfahan is Iran’s top tourist destination for good reason. Its profusion of tree-lined boulevards, Persian gardens and important Islamic buildings gives it a visual appeal unmatched by any other Iranian city, and the many artisans working here underpin its reputation as a living museum of traditional culture.
