TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday that based on the Caspian Sea convention no foreign country has the right to navigate or establish military base in the Caspian Sea.
 “According to the convention, no foreign country has the right to navigate militarily and non-militarily and establish base in the Caspian Sea and the five countries [bordering the Caspian Sea] will not permit other countries to attack any of the Caspian Sea littoral states,” he said. A landmark convention on the legal status of the inland waters was concluded in a summit attended by presidents of Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan in the Kazakh city of Aktau on Sunday. Qassemi said, “Signing this convention which is a strategic document of the Caspian Sea littoral states’ cooperation will turn the region into another pole of regional cooperation in line with the member states’ peace, stability and security.” Elsewhere, he rejected speculation about dividing the Caspian Sea. According to Press TV, under the convention, all legal issues of the sea should be implemented with the consensus of the five littoral states, President Hassan Rouhani said, stressing that the agreement did not include dividing the waters.
