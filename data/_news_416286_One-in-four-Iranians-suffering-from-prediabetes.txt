TEHRAN – While 10 percent of Iranians are diagnosed with diabetes, 25 percent of the population are suffering from prediabetes. “That means if they don’t get treatment, it will lead to type 2 diabetes,” ISNA quoted the deputy health minister Reza Malekzadeh as saying. In this case, about one third of Iranians would suffer from the disease in the next 15 years, he added. He named urbanization and industrialization as the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Having a body mass index (BMI) of higher than 25, a lack of regular exercise, and an unhealthy diet could also increase the risk of diabetes, he noted. More than 80 percent of disabilities are caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs), he said, referring to IraPEN, as a national health reform plan, which was launched in 2014 by the health ministry to provide general health coverage, including access to NCD prevention and care, and mental health services.
