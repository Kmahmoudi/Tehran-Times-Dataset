TEHRAN – A guesthouse will be opened in the city of Isfahan to accommodate health tourists who are suffering from cancer, IRIB reported on Friday. The lodging place is being built by the private sector next to Seyed-al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan province’s tourism chief Fereydoun Allahyari said. “The guesthouse is set to have 30 rooms and accommodate some 70 people per day who come from other regions of the country to use cancer treatment facilities of the hospital.” Isfahan is Iran’s top tourist destination for good reason; its profusion of tree-lined boulevards, Persian gardens and important Islamic buildings give it an unmatched visual appeal while on the other hand Isfahan’s many artisans underpin its reputation as a living museum of traditional culture.
