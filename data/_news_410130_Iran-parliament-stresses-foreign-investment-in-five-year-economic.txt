Iran's parliament passed a five-year economic development plan on Sunday that includes a sharp rise in foreign investment. The plan lets the government arrange up to an average of $30 billion of foreign financing each year, in addition to $15 billion of annual direct foreign investment in Iran, and up to $20 billion of foreign investment conducted with local partners. Such volumes of foreign investment would mark a big increase from levels seen in the past few decades. Since 2000, net inflows of foreign direct investment rarely exceeded $4 billion, according to the World Bank - a small amount by the standards of major emerging markets. Iranian officials have said they want foreign capital and technology to modernize a wide range of industries, estimating the key oil and gas sectors need about $180 billion of funds for expansion and maintenance during the next decade. The development plan, many details of which have yet to be published, calls for efforts to create jobs and curb inflation, which the government of President Hassan Rouhani has brought down to single digits from over 40 percent a few years ago. The development plan also features aspects of a "resistance economy" promoted by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has called for Iran to make its economy more self-sufficient so that it can resist outside pressure. The plan has to be approved by the Guardian Council, which vets legislation passed by parliament, before it takes effect.
