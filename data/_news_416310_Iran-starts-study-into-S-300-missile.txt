TEHRAN – Iran has started studies into the Russian-made S-300 missile system in order to know its workings, according to the deputy commander of the Khatam al-Anbia air defense unit.

 Second Brigadier General Abolfazl Sepehri-Rad on Sunday said the S-300 system is currently in service in Iran, fully integrated into Iran’s air defense network. The air defense missile system has been stationed in temporary locations across the country, the commander added, saying it is ready for any practical operation. Iran took delivery of missiles of the S-300 system in July 2016. In March 2017, during a war game dubbed Damavand, Iran conducted a successful test of the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system. The system can detect 20 targets simultaneously and directly engage with 12 separate hostile flying objects, including missiles, fighter jets or helicopters. Iran’s then army chief Major General Ataollah Salehi said the Islamic Republic has manufactured a missile defense system superior to S-300. “While the Islamic Republic has purchased S-300, it has also manufactured and will manufacture models superior to it,” he stated. Iranian military experts and technicians have in recent years made great headways in manufacturing a broad range of indigenous equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient in the arms sphere. Tehran has insisted that its military might poses no threat to regional countries, saying that the Islamic Republic’s defense doctrine is entirely based on deterrence. SP/PA
