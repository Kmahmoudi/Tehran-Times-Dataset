TEHRAN â€“ A patchwork of handicrafts indigenous to Zanjan Province has been put on show at the headquarters of the Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization in Tehran. Some 200 pieces of decorative copperware and handmade knives dominate the exhibit, which comes to an end tomorrow. Nested on a high plain, Zanjan boasts an excellent covered bazaar, some very attractive mosques, several fascinating museums, and Dome of Soltaniyeh, which is a 14th-century gigantic brick structure.
