TEHRAN â€“ The Islamic Azad University, Kerman branch, turned the spotlight on geometric patterns and designs in Islamic art during a two-day seminar held on December 4 and 5. The seminar was attended by Jean-Marc Castera, an established French expert in Islamic geometric art, who scrutinized connections between mathematics, arts and geometric arabesques. Professional workshops and field studies across the southcentral Iranian city were amongst programs embedded in the event, CHTN reported. Geometric patterns occur in a variety of forms in Islamic art and architecture including stained glass, kilim carpets, Persian girih, tilework, ceramics, leather, woodwork, and metalwork. Such decorations are often created on combinations of repeated squares and circles, which may be overlapped and interlaced, to form intricate and complex patterns. These may constitute the entire decoration or may retreat into the background around other motifs.
