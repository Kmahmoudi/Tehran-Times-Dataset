TEHRAN- The first steps to establish Iran-Japan joint chamber of commerce are being taken due to ratification of the Iranian Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA), Shana news agency reported on Wednesday. In a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in late September, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed willingness to visit Iran and boost economic ties with the country following the lifting of international sanctions on Tehran after a landmark nuclear deal it struck with six major powers in July last year.
Abe said he would like to visit Iran at an appropriate time, and called for an improved business environment in the oil-rich country so more Japanese companies can invest there, according to a senior Japanese official.
The two governments will coordinate the timing of the visit, the official told reporters.
Japan lifted its sanctions on Iran in January and signed a bilateral investment pact in February in a bid to help Japanese companies do business there amid intensifying foreign competition for access to the Iranian market.
