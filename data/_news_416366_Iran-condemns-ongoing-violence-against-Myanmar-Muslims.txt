TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Monday expressed grave concerns over the continued violence against Muslims in Myanmar that has led to the displacement of thousands of Rohingya Muslims. Iran condemns the miserable situation in which Myanmar Muslims are caught in, Qassemi said, adding Tehran is unhappy over the “slaughter” and “displacement” of the minority group in the Buddhist country. Over the past few days, intensifying clashes between security forces and insurgents in western Myanmar have pushed terrified civilians toward the Bangladesh border in a desperate search for refuge.
