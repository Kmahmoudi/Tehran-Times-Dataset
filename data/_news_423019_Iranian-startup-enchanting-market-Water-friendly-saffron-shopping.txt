The startup is founded by two brothers, Mohammad and Hamzeh Qaempanah and one of their friends Siamak Khorrami. The brothers are born in families who were saffron farmers for generations in Qaen city, located in South Khorasan province, which is renowned for its unique saffron products. The problem of aridity has forced farmers in Qaen to deplete underground water reservoir, which has increased the salinity of water and its salt levels continue to rise year over year due to increase in depth of wells and the saline water is not suitable for cultivating saffron. However, water shortage and saline water are not the only problems that the farmers must deal with. The main portion of their profit margin is earned by middlemen. In addition, the middlemen put a single price on all products, regardless of the quality of the saffron each farmer is producing. The founders of startup believe that the saffron farmers who are member of the startup, care about water they use for irrigation purposes. By purchasing from farmers, they are encouraged to keep up the good deed. Through the startup the founders find a way to connect farmers, who harvest their saffron without using chemical pesticide and fertilizers in traditional ways, with buyers. On their website, they stressed that they do not farm saffron neither buy it from farmers, they just supervise the harvesting process and connect buyers to farmers.
