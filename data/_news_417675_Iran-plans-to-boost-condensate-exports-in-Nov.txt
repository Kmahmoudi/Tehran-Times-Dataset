TEHRAN â€“ Iran plans to boost gas condensate exports by one percent in November from a five-month low in October, a source with knowledge of the country's preliminary tanker schedule announced. The increase in exports will come although maintenance at the South Pars field (Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf) will continue to drag on supply, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Iran plans to load a total of about 297,000 barrels per day (bpd) of condensate for export in November, up slightly from around 295,000 bpd this month, said the source, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media. Shipments of condensate are being dented by a "technical problem" at South Pars field, with maintenance expected to take 1-2 months to complete, National Iranian Oil Company's Director of International Affairs Saeid Khoshrou told Reuters in late September. Exports of condensate, used in petrochemical production, will return to about 450,000 bpd after the maintenance, although that is still well below the 550,000 bpd average over the last 15 months, the official said.
