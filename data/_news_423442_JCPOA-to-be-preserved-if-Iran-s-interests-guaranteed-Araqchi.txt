TEHRAN - Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday that the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, can be preserved only if other signatories to the multilateral agreement guarantee Iran’s interests.
 “It will be possible to keep the JCPOA if other signatories to the deal provide guarantees that Iran’s interests will be met,” he said during a meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Tehran. In a declaration on Tuesday, President Donald Trump officially withdrew the United States from the nuclear pact. He also said he will reinstate economic sanctions on Iran. Ryabkov expressed regret over the U.S. move and described it as a threat against international peace. “I assure you that Russia will stay in the agreement with full commitment and will do its best to preserve the deal in cooperation with other sides to the agreement,” Fars news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying.
