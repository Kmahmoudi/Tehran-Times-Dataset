TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that the government is duty bound to support Basij.
 Addressing a cabinet meeting, he said Basij played a “valuable” role during Iraq’s war against Iran in the 1980s. Rouhani made the remarks as Iran is celebrating Basij Week which falls between Nov. 19 to Nov. 25. The president said Muslims in many countries are following the model of Basij. “The Basij model, which was created by founder of the Islamic Revolution Imam Khomeini… can prove effective for Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan and all the Islamic countries when they face a problem,” he explained. He also said currently “economic development” is highly important and called on the Armed Forces including Basij to help stimulate the economy. Now economy is the main national issue and “enemy has targeted this area by the weapon of sanctions”, the president remarked. Rouhani noted that all should help to prop up the economy. Elsewhere, in his remarks the president said promoting ethics and fostering national unity are among other national priorities. NA/PA
