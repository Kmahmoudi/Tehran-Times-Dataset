TEHRAN – Iran’s Ambassador to the UK Hamid Baeidinejad on Wednesday strongly criticized the BBC Persian for trying to “legitimize” U.S. sanctions against Iran through revealing the names of companies involved in circumventing the sanctions. In a series of tweets, Baeidinejad said America’s intelligence agencies have provided the BBC Persian with intelligence on some Europe-based companies which help Iran in circumventing the sanctions. He also advised the UK-based TV channel against cooperating with the Trump administration in a “historic treason” against the Iranian nation and called for changes in the channel’s programs.
