TEHRAN – Police Chief Brigadier General Hossein Ashtari said on Saturday that the number of police stations across the country will be increased. Months ago, Tehran Police Chief Hossein Rahimi said police stations in Tehran province should be increased to be better able to fight crimes, which occur more frequently in Tehran’s suburbs. Ashtari said the increase will not be restricted to Tehran province and will be implemented throughout the country, Mehr reported. He stressed that police forces should act with power, kindness and mercy at the same time.
