Clinton, who played a key role in forging the Good Friday peace accord, met both British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern ahead of the latest talks Monday on Ulster. The former U.S. leader was staying overnight as a private guest at Chequers, Blair's official country residence outside London. AFP quoted Downing Street as saying Clinton's presence was a "complete coincidence," but it prompted suggestions that the former president could use his personal influence in contentious discussions on Northern Ireland's future. State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said the Bush administration was aware of Clinton's visit to Britain, and his "Willingness to contact the parties. "We welcome his support, obviously now in a private capacity, for the Northern Ireland peace process," said Boucher. But Boucher declined to comment specifically on any possible personal role for Clinton in the process, sticking to general comments on the role of former U.S. leaders. "There's no ban on travel by former presidents... Former presidents often travel. They have a role in the world." White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Clinton had contacted the State Department in his capacity as a private citizen to talk about the Northern Ireland situation. "When former presidents travel, they often contact either state or NSC (the National Security Council) to talk to the current government." NSC spokesman Sean McCormack underlined the private nature of Clinton's visit. "We knew in advance that president Clinton was going to be traveling to the UK, we knew of his willingness to assist with regard to the Northern Ireland situation." "He is traveling as a private citizen and not as a representative of the administration." Clinton's successor, President George W. Bush, has shown less inclination to become personally involved in the Northern Ireland situation. But he has "offered to be helpful to the peace process in any way we can," in implementing the 1998 peace accord, Boucher added. Downing Street said Monday that Clinton did not participate in a meeting between Blair and Ahern, though the former U.S. leader played a key role in brokering the Good Friday accords which cleared the way for a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Clinton had always "stood ready to be involved if he could."
