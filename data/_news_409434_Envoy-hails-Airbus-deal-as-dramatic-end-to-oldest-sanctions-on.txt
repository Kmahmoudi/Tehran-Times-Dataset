TEHRAN – The Iranian ambassador to London said in an Instagram message Saturday that the recent deal between Iran and Airbus is more than a “usual trade agreement,” hailing it as a dramatic end to the most long-standing sanctions program against the country.   “The Airbus contract is not a usual trade agreement,” Hamid Baeedinejad said, citing four reasons. Initially, as an outcome of an international deal between Iran and six world powers, this is first time Iran has clinched a deal directly with Airbus in nearly four decades. 
Secondly, over a very short period of time Iran will be taking delivery of a number of airplanes in 2017.  IranAir will receive seven or eight planes from Airbus in 2017, according to Farhad Parvaresh, the managing director of the airliner. 
Moreover, the agreement is expected to prosper Iran’s aviation industry, the ambassador underscored, adding, “Last year, the Iranians spent nearly $5 billion on trips with foreign airlines.”  Last but not least, conclusion of the deal will contribute to flourishing trade with Germany, France, and England as main Airbus stakeholders.  This, in turn, works toward banking and financial ties with key European countries, he concluded.  Iran and Airbus signed a deal during a visit to Paris by President Hassan Rouhani in January 2106.  Under the initial contract, Iran had ordered 118 Airbus planes worth $25 billion, trimming it to 100 planes worth not more than $10 billion this time, partly by dropping superjumbo A380s.  Also, Iran signed a $16.6 billion deal for 80 Boeing passenger on December 11.  Iranian airlines need to buy around 500 planes over the next ten years to replace their ageing fleets and to take advantage of the expected growth in air travel in the coming years. 
Iranian carriers currently own a 250-strong fleet, but at least 100 of their planes have either broken down or been stripped for spare parts. AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
