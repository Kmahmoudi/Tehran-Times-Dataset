TEHRAN – “I wanted to prove to all the world that wearing hijab is not a limitation,” said Khadijeh Azadpour, the winner of 2010 Guangzhou Asian Championships wushu gold medal.    “I’m so glad that I could take part in international competitions and won the gold medal while wearing hijab,” she said, Fars news agency reported. “Some people consider hijab in Iran’s sport as a problem but I believe that is not true,” she said, adding, “We wear hijab from the very first during practice sessions and get used to it.” She generously sold her gold medal for 20 billion rials (nearly $500,000) to aid victims of the recent Kermanshah earthquake. Appreciating the sportswoman humanitarian act, head of Women’s Basij Organization Minoo Aslani, described her as “the role model for Muslim girls.” MAH/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
