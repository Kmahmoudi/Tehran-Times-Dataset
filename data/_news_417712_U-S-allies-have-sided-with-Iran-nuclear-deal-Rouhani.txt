TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that the United States’ “traditional allies” and other countries have sided with Iran and the 2015 nuclear deal.
 “Even the U.S. traditional allies did not accompany the U.S. administration and immediately announced their opposition [to the U.S.] and said that they will stand beside the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and will continue cooperation,” Rouhani said during a meeting of the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution. Commenting on U.S. President Donald Trump’s Friday speech, Rouhani said that the speech contained nothing except repeating “unfounded accusations” and “old claims”. He added “domestic unity” and “international support” for the JCPOA will make the U.S. officials review their policies. The president noted that the Trump administration is following the path of “isolation”. Trump on Friday unveiled a new strategy on confronting Iran, which included “de-certifying” Iran’s compliance to the nuclear accord despite repeated confirmations by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog body, that Iran is living up to its obligations. The European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has said the 27-nation bloc will remain committed to the nuclear deal with or without the United States. All international dignitaries have said the agreement which went into force in early 2016 is working well.
