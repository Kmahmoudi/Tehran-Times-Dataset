TEHRAN — Iran’s Food and Drug Administration will turn the spotlight on ‘changing dietary habits to live healthier life’ on World Food Day 2018, ISNA news agency reported on Sunday.  World Food Day is celebrated every year around the world on October 16 to mark the date of the founding of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in 1945. The day is celebrated widely by many other organizations concerned with food security, including the World Food Programme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The World Food Day theme for 2018 is “a zero hunger world by 2030 in possible”. In Iran programs with the objectives of cutting back on sugar, salt and fat, labeling food and drink products with 'traffic light', taking measure against food smuggling and promoting food standards in order to protect public health in relation to food will launch to mark the event, Iran’s Food and Drug Administration director Gholamreza Asghari has said.  A zero hunger world FAO states that zero hunger means working together to ensure everyone, everywhere, has access to the safe, healthy and nutritious food they need. To achieve it, we must adopt a more sustainable lifestyle, work with others, share our knowledge and be willing to help change the world – for the better. As per the latest FAO 2018 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report after a period of decline, world hunger is on the rise again. Today, over 820 million people are suffering chronic undernourishment.  The world can achieve Zero Hunger if we join forces across nations, continents, sectors and professions, and act on evidence. 70% of the world's poor live in rural areas where people’s lives depend on agriculture, fisheries or forestry. That’s why Zero hunger calls for a transformation of rural economy. Governments must create opportunities for greater private sector investments in agriculture, while boosting social protection programmes for the vulnerable and linking food producers with urban areas. Zero Hunger moves beyond conflict-resolution and economic growth, taking the long-term approach to build peaceful, inclusive societies. While millions go hungry, 672 million people suffer from obesity, and a further 1.3 billion are overweight. And this can change.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
