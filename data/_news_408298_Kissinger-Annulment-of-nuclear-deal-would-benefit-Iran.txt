TEHRAN – Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said at a New York City gathering on Thursday that a revocation of the Iran nuclear agreement would benefit Iran more than the U.S., Breitbart News reported. He made the remarks at the America-Israel Friendship League’s 2016 Partners for Democracy Awards Dinner, where the former U.S. secretary of state was the guest of honor. On the future of the Iran deal after Trump takes office in January, Kissinger said, “I would not have made [the agreement], but we will not get a great deal out of ending it now.” The nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is an international contract that was reached between Iran and the 5+1 group (the U.S., Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany) in July 2015. The UN Security Council ratified a resolution endorsing the nuclear pact. During his demagoguery remarks during the campaigns the president-elect Trump called the nuclear agreement a "disaster" and "the worst deal ever negotiated". However, later he toned down his rhetoric, saying it needs a revision.   Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, responded last week to Trump’s presidency, saying the U.S. can’t cancel the Iran nuclear deal. “The nuclear deal is [done] in the framework of the UN Security Council, [it is] not a bilateral or national issue,” Mogherini said. Pointing to the results of last week’s presidential election, Kissinger described Republican Trump’s victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton a “revolution against conventional wisdom.” Trump, in an upset over Clinton, won U.S. presidency and will start his tenure on January 20.
