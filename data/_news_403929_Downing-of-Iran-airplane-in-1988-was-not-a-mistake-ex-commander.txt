TEHRAN â€“ The downing of Iran Air Flight 655 in the summer of 1988 over the Persian Gulf was not a mistake on the part of the U.S. Marine Force, an ex-commander in the Iranian Navy has said.  Speaking on the anniversary of the downing, Nasser Sarnevest, who had commanded the search for the victims, told Fars on Saturday that the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes carried out a command in precision when it hit the Iranian passenger aircraft.
