"Based on the IRGC observations in the region over recent days, the U.S. forces have not staged any military exercise," said IRGC navy commander Rear Admiral Tangsiri while denying a U.S. navy commander's claim that the U.S. had launched an unusual and unprecedented war game in Persian Gulf, involving 100 navy aircraft. The U.S. officials have also claimed that the U.S.' "unusual" exercise over recent days involved two U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups in the Persian Gulf. "Our navy forces, stationed in the Persian Gulf and Hormuz Strait, keep a close eye on the region and fully control any movement by foreign forces," added Tangsiri.
