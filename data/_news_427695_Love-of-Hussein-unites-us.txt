TEHRAN – Muslims around the globe held massive mourning ceremonies on Thursday, the day of Ashura, to commemorate the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hussein (AS) and his companions.

 Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon in particular witnessed large gatherings of the lovers of Imam Hussein mourning his martyrdom. Ashura, the 10th day of the lunar month of Muharram, marks the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and his 72 faithful companions in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. In Iran, devotees in all cities and villages performed the religious ritual of wearing black clothes, listening to elegies recounting the tragic events in the Battle of Karbala, slapping their chests and chanting in commemoration of their beloved Imam. On social media, users trended the Arabic phrase for “love of Hussein unites us”. Every year on Ashura, millions of Muslims and even many non-Muslims around the world, dressed in black, take to the streets and mosques to mourn the sad occasion. Muharram ceremonies represent the never-ending and unswerving stance of the truth against falsehood and the humanity’s struggle against tyranny, the cause for which Imam Hussein sacrificed his life.
