TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian who is in New York for the annual UN conference announced on Saturday that he has received messages in recent days from American sides in which they have said Washington is determined and has the “goodwill” to reach an agreement to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Amir Abdollahian said he has instead sent messages to the Americans that it is necessary that they show “determination and goodwill” for achieving an agreement. “Even in the recent days the American side declared to us that they have the necessary will and goodwill for reaching an agreement, and we told them to show their determination and goodwill in a realistic way and prove that we can reach the point of an agreement,” Amir Abdollahian told IRNA and IRIB correspondents in New York. Amir Abdollahian has been holding talks in New York with his counterparts from Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Brazil, the UAE, Armenia, Iraq, Uganda, etc. He said his talks with foreign ministers of these countries primarily focused on lifting economic sanctions by saving the nuclear deal. “That we are in New York it creates sensitivity among the foreign sides that what will happen,” Iran’s chief diplomat remarked. He added Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator also met European Union political director Enrique Mora and diplomats from the countries involved in the nuclear talks in Vienna and “in the negotiations that I had with different sides over the last two days this issue was among the major topics.” Amir Abdollahian added, “In these meetings I insisted that we have the necessary will and seriousness and basically now it is the American side that should have the courage to take decision so that we can talk about a good, strong and durable agreement.” The 2015 nuclear deal was abandoned in May 2018 by former U.S. president Donald Trump in line with his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.  Trump did this despite the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in its regular reports that Iran was fully loyal to the terms of agreement. According to the JCPOA confirmed by UN Security Council Resolution 2231, Iran was tasked to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination economic and financial sanctions.       All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
