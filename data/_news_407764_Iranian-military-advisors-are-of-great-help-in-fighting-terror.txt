TEHRAN - Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a special aide to Majlis speaker for international affairs, said on Thursday that the presence of Iranian military advisors in Iraq and Syria is an “effective step” in the war against terrorism.
 Iranian military advisors are in Iraq and Syria upon official requests by the Baghdad and Damascus governments, Amir-Abdollahian said during a meeting with Swiss Secretary of Foreign Affairs Yves Rossier in Tehran. Amir-Abdollahian went on to say that Iran is determined to help restore peace to the Middle East region. “Iran has always been on the belief that political solutions are the only ways out of the regional and international crises and has spared no efforts on this regard,” he remarked. He went on to say that repeated mistakes by the U.S. and its allies in the region have caused the current chaos in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya. He described terrorism as the “most serious threat” against the world and highlighted the importance of “collective and serious cooperation” to fight it. The aide to the parliament speaker also praised Switzerland for its efforts to help solve conflicts in the region. For his part, Rossier said that Switzerland considers “political and non-military” solutions as the only ways to settle crises. He attached great importance to Iran’s role in helping restore peace and stability to the region. Switzerland welcomes joint actions with Iran to boosting international peace and stability, Rossier pointed out. NA/PA
