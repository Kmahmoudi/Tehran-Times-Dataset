TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said on Sunday that there is an international consensus that the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and great powers is beneficial to the “security”, “stability” and “development” of the entire world. 
 Rouhani made the remarks at Mehrabad airport before departing for New York to attend the annual UN General Assembly meeting. He said there are only two or three ruling system including the Trump administration which are against the JCPOA - the official name for the nuclear agreement - because they feel it has undermined their plan to demonize the Islamic Republic. He also noted that Iran seeks to have “constructive” relations with the world. Commenting on the crises in the Middle East, he said that the regional conflicts should be settled “politically” and not “militarily”. The Iranian president went on to say that terrorism must be defeated through international cooperation. Elsewhere, Rouhani said that the world should condemn cruelty being committed against the Rohingya by Myanmar’s government and army. According to Reuters, nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims from western Myanmar have crossed into Bangladesh since August 25, fleeing a Myanmar government offensive against insurgents that the UN has branded a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.
