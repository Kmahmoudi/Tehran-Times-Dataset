TEHRAN – Head of Iran’s Civil Defense Organization said on Tuesday that new threats and incidents might occur in the current Persian year as well, calling for more efforts to prevent any threat against the country’s security. “We should consider potentials, threats and damages that lie ahead and take a measure that the Leader of the Revolution expects from us,” said Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali, ISNA reported. “The Leader of the Revolution believes that today marks the rise of Iran and that’s why too much focus is put on posing threats against us,” he stressed.
