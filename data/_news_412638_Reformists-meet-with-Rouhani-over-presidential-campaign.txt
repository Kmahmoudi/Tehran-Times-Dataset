TEHRAN – A number of reformist figures met with President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday morning to know about his views about presidential race, Tasnim reported, without giving their names.

 Quoting an anonymous source from the reformists, the news agency said they “expressed worry over the odds that Rouhani fails to get votes and stressed the necessity that alternative candidates run by Rouhani’s side.” Later, one of their suggested substitutes, First Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri, registered his name for presidency.
