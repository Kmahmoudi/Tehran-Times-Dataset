Iran water polo coach Aleksandar Ciric says that they have been drawn in a tough group in the 19th FINA World Men's Junior Water Polo Championships.  Iran have been drawn in Group A along with the U.S., Russia, Greece and Puerto Rico. Group B consists of the Netherlands, Montenegro, Spain, Japan and Croatia. Hosts Serbia, the defending champions, will play in group C against New Zealand, Australia, China, and Argentina. Silver and bronze medalists at the previous World championships – Italy and Hungary – are in group D, and will cross swords Egypt, Canada and South Africa. “We are in a tough group since three powerhouse teams are in the group. The U.S. coach has said they are well-prepared for the competition. Russia and Greece are favorites as well,” Ciric said. “Iran will have difficult matches in the group but we can qualify for the next stage. We will hold a training camp in Belgrade a week ahead of the competition to get well-prepared for the event,” Ciric added. “We became runners-up in the Islamic Solidarity Games in Baku and I believe that Iran water polo team are getting better every day,” the Serbian coach added.   There will be four groups of five teams, which form groups A, B, C and D. The four highest ranked teams in each group will qualify for the Quarter Final Round. The second and third ranked teams will meet in the second round, while the fourth and fifth in each group will be eliminated from the race for medals, but will play for positions 13th to 20th.
