TEHRAN â€“ Japan inked five memoranda of understanding (MOUs) to support non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are working specifically in the social development sector. Known as the GGP (Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects), it provides flexible and timely support to small-scale development projects, which aim to improve the social well-being of the people at the grassroots level. Japanese Ambassador to Iran Aikawa Kazutoshi said that GGP has been started in Iran since 1999 and has completed 150 projects in various fields, including the expansion of primary education, primary health care, public welfare, and rural development throughout the country.
