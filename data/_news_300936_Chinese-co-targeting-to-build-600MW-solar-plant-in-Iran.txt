TEHRAN- The Chinese company of Shanxi Energy, in a meeting with top officials from Iran Renewable Energy Organization named SUNA, poised readiness to construct a 600-megawatt photovoltaic power plant in the Islamic Republic.   According to the IRNA news agency, the Chinese company built a 100-megawatt-hydroelectrical power plant in Iran in 2007 and intends to revive its presence after the country’s nuclear deal with P5+1, primarily by construction of a 50-megawatt solar plant.  The Iranian government plans to install 5,000 MW of renewable capacity, putting the country among the likes of the UK and France.  The Iranian Power Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Management Company (Tavanir) estimates that renewables will generate around 10 percent of Iran’s electricity production requirements within five years. Until recently, economic sanctions would have made achieving such an ambitious goal very difficult, if not impossible. However, by lifting of the sanctions, many foreign companies are showing interest to provide finance and transfer technology for building solar and wind farms in the Islamic Republic. In January, Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Houshang Falahatian said a very proper ground has been laid in Iran to attract investment for the establishment of solar and also wind farms in the country.     HJ/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
