TEHRAN – If U.S. President Donald Trump scraps the Iran nuclear deal, the first loser may be U.S. aircraft maker Boeing, the CNBC reported. The U.S. aircraft maker has an agreement to sell 80 new planes to Iran Air and another 30 to Iranian carrier Aseman. The total value of those deals is about 20 billion dollars. Trump’s administration has sought to scrap or weaken the 2015 deal and get rid of the limits it imposes on the U.S. ability to pursue more hostile policies against Iran.
