TEHRAN – Iranian Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Hossein Baqeri said on Sunday that there are reliable intelligence reports that President Donald Trump has made attempts over the past 12 months to compel the U.S. Army to carry out military attack against Iran.
 “The current U.S. president does not talk about war, however, there are credible information based on which he has attempted to force the U.S. Army to carry out military attack on Iran during the past year,” Baqeri told a meeting. The top general added other than economic sanctions it is not possible to predict what other actions the U.S. would take against Iran in the future.  “It is not possible to predict the future. Enemy has targeted economy and has focused on sanctions. However, various types of threats can be in this scenario,” the top general stated. He noted, “So, all the Iranian people and also the armed forces, as supporter of the Islamic system and security, should be ready.” U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and said sanctions will be restored against Iran. According to the U.S. Treasury, the first stage of sanctions will be snapped back in August and the primary ones in November. Trump has asked countries to cut their oil imports from Iran by November. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in May that the U.S. will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic.
