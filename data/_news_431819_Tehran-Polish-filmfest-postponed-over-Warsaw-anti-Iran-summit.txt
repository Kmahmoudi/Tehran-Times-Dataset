TEHRAN – The Cinema Organization of Iran (COI) has postponed a Polish film festival in Tehran indefinitely in response to Poland’s decision to host a U.S.-led anti-Iran summit. The postponement was announced on Sunday by COI director Hossein Entezami on Twitter. “Iranians have warmly received various nations, especially Polish people, during hard times,” he said. “A guest who is not respectful toward his host could not expect any longer to enjoy his stay with him,” he noted and added, the Polish film festival is postponed until “appropriate behavior from Warsaw.”  The Polish film festival was scheduled to be organized in collaboration with the Embassy of Poland at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art from January 27 to February 1. Earlier on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Washington’s plan to organize a global summit focused on Iran and the Middle East in Warsaw from February 13 to 14.
