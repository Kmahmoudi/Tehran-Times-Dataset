TEHRAN – Iranian Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian inaugurated the country’s largest wind farm in the northwestern province of Qazvin on Monday, IRNA reported. As reported, the 61.4-megawatts wind farm was built in a year using the world’s latest technology and knowledge and the cost of implementing the project was €86 million. The farm is comprised of 18 turbines each of which will generate 4.3 megawatts (MW) of electricity. Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, the minister noted that wind farms account for over 45 percent of the country’s total 650MW of renewable capacity. Last week, Head of Iran’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (known as SATBA) said that the capacity of generating electricity from renewable resources in Iran will reach 1100 MW by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019), IRIB reported. “With the new 450 MW of under-construction power plants being added to the current capacity, the capacity of renewable power plants this year will reach 1100 MW,” Seyyed Mohammad Sadeqzadeh, said. Renewables, including hydropower, account for just six percent of energy generation, versus natural gas’ 90 percent share. Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence in the regional electricity market.
