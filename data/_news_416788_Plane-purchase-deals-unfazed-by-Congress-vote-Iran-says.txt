TEHRAN - The recent voting of the U.S. Congress to block sales of commercial aircraft to Iran will have no effect on the plane purchase deals already signed by Iran and international companies, head of the Civil Aviation Organization of Iran Ali Abedzadeh said on Friday.
 “All the deals have been signed at an international level in compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and approved by the United Nations,” Abedzadeh told IRNA.
“Undoubtedly all the companies will be committed to the deals,” he highlighted.
On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of new measures that would specifically prevent the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) from clearing licenses to allow aircraft sales while also prohibit the use of funds to authorize the required financial transactions.
The implementation of the nuclear deal in January 2016 led to the removal of sanctions against Iran, allowing the country to purchase hundreds of commercial aircraft from Airbus, Boeing and a number of other companies.
Iran’s flag carrier, Iran Air, signed a contract with Boeing for purchasing 80 airplanes from the American manufacturer. The company also finalized a deal on the purchase of 20 ATR 72-600 from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer. 
Also, Iran’s Aseman Airlines sealed a deal with Boeing on purchasing 60 aircrafts.
