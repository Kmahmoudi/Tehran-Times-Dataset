TEHRAN- As Shana news agency reported on Monday, the Iranian cabinet approved Iran, India, Afghanistan trilateral transit pact (Known as Chabahar Treaty) in its Sunday meeting. Iran, India and Afghanistan signed a tripartite trade and transit corridor agreement on Chabahar port in Tehran in late May.Â  The treaty allows the three countries open new routes to connect among themselves via converting the Iranian southeastern port of Chabahar into a transit hub bypassing Pakistan. Accordingly, through Chabahar port India can bypass Pakistan and transport goods to Afghanistan and central Asia, while Afghanistan can get linked to India via sea. The document was signed in the presence of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
