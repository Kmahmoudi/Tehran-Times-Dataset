TEHRAN – Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Sunday that the house arrest against opposition leaders who claimed vote rigging in the 2009 presidential election would be resolved in the upcoming Iranian New Year, which begins on March 21.
 “The Secretariat of the Supreme National Security Council has taken good actions to end the house arrest and, God willing, this will happen in the next year,” Jahangiri said. The remarks came after the Deputy Majlis Speaker Ali Motahari said top security and intelligence authorities “broke their promises” regarding the house arrest, which they had said would be lifted by the end of the current Iranian year.
