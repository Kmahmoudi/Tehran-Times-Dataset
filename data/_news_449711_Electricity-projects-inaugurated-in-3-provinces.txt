TEHRAN – Iranian Energy Ministry Inaugurated 43 electricity projects in three provinces on Tuesday, during the 10th week of the ministry’s A-B-Iran scheme under which every week major energy projects are going to be inaugurated in various provinces across the country, IRIB reported. The mentioned projects include 40 power supply projects in southwestern Khuzestan Province, the replacement of 4,700 kilometers of low-pressure transmission lines with self-supporting cables in North Khorasan province in the northeast of the country, and the upgrade of a power plant in northern Mazandaran province.

The inauguration ceremony was attended by Mohammad-Hassan Motevalizadeh, the head of Iran’s Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Management Company, known as Tavanir. A-B-Iran scheme [the acronyms A and B stand for water, electricity in Persian] was initiated in the previous Iranian calendar year (ended on March 19), during which the minister made 31 trips to various provinces for inaugurating over 220 major projects with a total investment of 335.6 trillion rials (about $7.99 billion).
