TEHRAN – Iran’s military chief said on Wednesday that the Armed Forces are prepared more than any other time to defend the country against foreign threats, asserting that Iran doesn’t need anyone’s “smile” or go-ahead with its plans to boost defense power, ISNA reported. Major General Mohammad Hossein Baqeri made the remarks in an address to the parliament on the eve of the anniversary of the liberation of Khorramshahr from the Iraqi occupation in 1982. The general also pointed to the recent pressure on Iran by Washington and its regional allies, especially after Trump effectively withdraw the U.S. from the internationally-backed 2015 nuclear deal, saying, “We can move beyond current incidents only by relying on domestic power and potential as well as benefiting from [our] regional and international friends.”   The senior commander said while breaking its promises the U.S. has laid out a list of “dos” and “don’ts” for the Islamic Republic. The U.S. leaders have turned into employees of the Zionist regime, he added. It came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would increase financial pressure on Iran by slapping it with the “strongest sanctions in history” if Tehran refuses to fulfill Washington’s 12-point list of demands. One of the conditions that Pompeo put forward was that Iran stop its ballistic-missile program. General Baqeri said since the U.S. does not dare to confront Iran militarily, it is thus trying to bring the Iranian nation under pressure through an “economic war”. In remarks on Tuesday, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said it is “understandable” that the United States and its regional allies, which are the main creators and supporters of the Takfiri terrorism, be “angry” as Iran prevented Daesh (ISIL) to spread its domain of ruling in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even Europe.
