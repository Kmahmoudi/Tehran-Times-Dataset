TEHRAN - Hamid Aboutalebi, a political advisor to President Hassan Rouhani, has indirectly called on landlocked Afghanistan that its interests lie in interaction with Iran in sharing water on the basis of international law.
 “Interaction among the neighboring countries is based on common interests; ignoring common interests and violating the international law on water is not beneficial for (landlocked) countries,” Aboutalebi tweeted on Saturday. The Afghan government has announced that it plans to build new dams on Hamun River. During an opening speech at the International Conference on Combating Sand and Dust Storms in Tehran last Monday, President Rouhani said, “If Hamun’s water dries up, in addition to Sistan and Baluchistan, Afghanistan itself will be in danger.” Rouhani said environmental issues are “extra-national and extra-regional challenges”. “We cannot succeed in overcoming environmental challenges without cooperating with neighboring countries,” the president remarked. He also said, “The only way to live peacefully in the West Asia and Middle East region is adopting a win-win policy in the area of environment, helping and standing beside each other.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
