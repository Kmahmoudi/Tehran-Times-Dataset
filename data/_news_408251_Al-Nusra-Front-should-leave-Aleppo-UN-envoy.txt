TEHRAN - UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said on Saturday that Al-Nusra Front is a terrorist group that must leave the Syrian city of Aleppo.
 “We call for a halt to all the military activities in eastern and western parts of Aleppo, and we believe that Al-Nusra, as a terrorist group, must definitely leave eastern parts of Aleppo,” he said after his meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Jaberi Ansari in Tehran. Commenting on the UN actions in countering terrorists’ crimes in the city, he said serious efforts are being made to help the people exit the eastern areas of Aleppo. He added, “We condemn killings and any kind of crime in Aleppo and we are still studying our proposal concerning the exit of the people and the terrorist groups from Aleppo,” he said. NA/PA
