TEHRAN- The White House renewed its state of national emergency with Iran on Tuesday which was initially declared in 1979. In a statement posted on the White House website, Biden stated that “our relations with Iran have not yet normalized, and the process of implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is ongoing.”  He added, “Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 with respect to Iran.” Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the seizure of the U.S. embassy, often known as the "seizure of the Den of Espionage," the national emergency was declared on November 14, 1979. Since then, it has been revived on occasion. The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran on April 7, 1980.
