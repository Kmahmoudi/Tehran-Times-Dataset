TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry has warned of widespread famine and risk of starvation in Yemen, blaming Riyadh for the catastrophe in the war-torn country. “Yemeni people are living in very difficult conditions as the continuation of war as well as air and sea blockade on the country has caused a large portion of the people to face risk of famine and starvation,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Tuesday. Qassemi also urged the international community to provide humanitarian aid for the Arab country.
