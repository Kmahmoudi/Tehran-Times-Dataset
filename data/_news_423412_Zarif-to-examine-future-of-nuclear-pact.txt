TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday that he will spearhead a diplomatic effort to examine whether the other signatories of the JCPOA can ensure its full benefits for Iran in the face of U.S. withdrawal. “In response to U.S. persistent violations & unlawful withdrawal from the nuclear deal, as instructed by President Rouhani, I'll spearhead a diplomatic effort to examine whether remaining JCPOA participants can ensure its full benefits for Iran. Outcome will determine our response,” Zarif tweeted. It came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump officially withdrew the United States from the nuclear agreement.
