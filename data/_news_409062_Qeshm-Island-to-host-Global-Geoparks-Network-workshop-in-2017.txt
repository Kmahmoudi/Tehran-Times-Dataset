TEHRAN – The southern Iranian Qeshm Island will play host to Global Geoparks Network Workshop for Middle East Region, which will be held from April 24 to 26, 2017. Founded in 2004 as an international partnership developed under the umbrella of UNESCO, the GGN seeks to promote professional management of global geoparks and raise multi-cultural links to the maintenance of geological sites. The GNN oversees about 120 geoparks it had registered in China, Spain, Germany, Norway, France, Malaysia, Japan, Italy and other countries. A geopark is a clearly defined area with geological heritage of significance that fosters environmentally appropriate, socio-economic sustainable development.  Qeshm as the largest island in the Persian Gulf is also known for its wide range of ecotourism attractions such as the Hara marine forests. Back in September, the Qeshm Free Zone Organization in close collaboration with the private sector started creating eight eco camps along the coastlines. The island has an abundance of wildlife, including birds, reptiles, dolphins and turtles. It is home to about 60 villages which are dotted mostly across its rocky coastlines. Popular ecotourism activities in Iran include mountain and desert treks, bird watching in coastal areas and wetlands as well as diving.
