Ayatollah Khamenei said on the birth anniversary of Imam Ali (AS) that it is an "immediate, urgent and indispensable" need that all officials follow the government model of the first Imam of Prophet Mohammad's Infallible Household. The Leader said officials should focus all their efforts on building a prosperous, advanced and powerful society, IRNA reported. All officials of the establishment, including the leadership, president, ministers, Judiciary officials, MPs and directors of different organs nationwide, should attend to the oppressed and poor strata and observe piety. This is to ensure that the Islamic rule is observed and justice is administered as well as discrimination is uprooted, the Leader added. "Only in this case, people will attain happiness and a steely powerful society will be established," Ayatollah Khamenei said. He cited rule of justice as another characteristic of Imam Ali's government. "If a person commits an injustice in a political competition such as elections or any other scene or pays no heed to the poverty and corruption around himself or implements laws with discrimination, this is violation of Imam Ali's government pattern" he added. "In our effort to establish this model, it is not important whether the rest of the world agrees with us or becomes displeased," the Leader said. Ayatollah Khamenei also slammed the U.S. for its human rights and anti-terror claims as well as those who want an American type of government be established in Iran. "Are those who gave chemical weapons to Iraq, only to want now to attack that country for having chemical arms, and those who support the Zionist regime's blatant and heinous terrorism, real proponents of human rights? "Is it possible to chant both Islamic slogans and want to use them (Americans) as model?," the Leader asked. The Iranian nation, especially the faithful youth and officials, who are taking their strength from God, are determined to confront plots and propaganda of the imperialist powers, he said. "They will not let America's international dictatorship dominate this country again," Ayatollah Khamenei added.   
