TEHRAN – The Iranian foreign minister believes Saudis’ anti-Iranian propaganda campaign is psychologically motivated as they, lacking confidence, desperately seek attention.   “The Saudis sought to make allusions that Iran is dangerous. We know this is because of their weakness and lack of confidence,” said Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday, addressing a meeting in Tehran.  The Iranian foreign policy point man also linked the psycho feebleness to the Middle East’s shaky situations, saying the Saudi government is seeking attention through fueling regional tension and instability.   “The (Saudi) government would imagine it could secure a place in the region by triggering tensions and unrest,” Zarif stated.  Zarif’s comments come after meetings with senior officials of Russia and Turkey.  Zarif says, “The (Saudi) government would imagine it could secure a place in the region by triggering tensions and unrest.” Lately, Turkish officials have been mending fences with Russia, a sign that Ankara may distance itself from Saudi Arabia over the Syrian conflict.  Tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, two longtime rivals, soared after the Sunni-led Saudi Arabia executed Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a prominent Shiite cleric, on January 2.  Al-Nimr was convicted on a string of charges, including sowing dissent and stirring anti-government protests.  The execution was condemned by human rights organizations and sparked widespread protests in Iran. Demonstrations outside of the Saudi diplomatic posts in Tehran and Mashhad turned violent and protesters stormed the buildings. Riyadh responded by cutting diplomatic relations with Tehran.  The two countries also support opposing sides in Syria’s civil war and the ongoing conflict in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country.
