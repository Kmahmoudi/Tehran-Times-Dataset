TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that many of the country’s domestic problems originate from “lack of truthfulness”. “What does truthfulness mean? It means that when you say something, it should conform to reality,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to his official website, khamenei.ir. “If you do not know whether what you say is confirmed by facts or not, but you say it anyway, this is not truthfulness,” he added. However, the Leader said, despite such issues “our country is an Islamic country and to be fair, it is better than many societies in the world in terms of purity and sincerity.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
