Gholamali Khoshroo, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, has said “those who pursue sanctions and coercion, instead of diplomacy and negotiation, by their deeds and rhetoric, strengthen extremism”.
 Khoshroo made the remarks as he was addressing the UN General Assembly’s forum on “Culture of Peace” on Thursday. “Unilateralism and coercive measures in international relations are the cause of instability, insecurity and expansion of terrorism and extremism,” the ambassador noted. Following is full text of his speech: As the Charter of the United Nations confirms, the realization of international peace and security is the ultimate goal of the United Nations. Hence, today’s topic, Culture of Peace, lies at the heart of the work of this organization. It has been accurately perceived that Culture of Peace is the essence of the UN Charter. The United Nations, as the largest international organization, has been created to save humankind from the scourge of war. Thus, this organization bears a paramount responsibility to combat the evils of extremism and terrorism as well as to promote peace and a culture which nourishes, supports and sustains it. Those who pursue sanctions and coercion, instead of diplomacy and negotiation, by their deeds and rhetoric, strengthen extremism and in turn weaken the culture of peace and tolerance. Unilateralism and coercive measures in international relations are the cause of instability, insecurity and expansion of terrorism and extremism. The successful cases where diplomacy has proved to be effective, such as the JCPOA, should be regarded as patterns of action in international affairs. No one should be allowed to beat the drum of threat and to ridicule the international community. The failed and violent experiences of the past should not be repeated. The Middle East region has turned into an exhibition of modern and deadly weapons. Each of those weapons cause a scar on the feeble body of peace. It is in such circumstances that extremism finds a fertile ground to expand and violence becomes the only possible means of interaction. We have to combat cultures of unilateralism and extremism simultaneously. When the so-called “alliances”, in parallel with terrorist groups, pour bombs over sacred places, schools and hospitals they suffocate the culture of peace with their iron hands. As Iranian martyr, Mohsen Hojjajji, is beheaded in front of cameras by terrorist and takfiri elements of Daesh (ISIL) in Syria, the international community has a responsibility with regard to this crime. Those who have helped terrorist groups to grow, either by their distorted ideologies or by financial and logistical means, should be held accountable today. The path to combating violence and extremism runs through universal support for the culture of peace and friendship. The Middle East is the birth place of ancient the divine religions. As such, this region should not be polluted by the filth of extremism. Meanwhile, strengthening the culture of peace is essential all over the world. The recent tragic events unfolding with regard to the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar is another situation where innocent people are falling prey to the evils of intolerance and extremism. We strongly condemn the ongoing violence against the Rohingya Muslims and call for its immediate end. Hundreds of innocent people have lost their lives and hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. What is happening today in many parts of the world, from the Occupied Palestinian territory to Yemen, all reflect cases of failure in our joint endeavor towards forming a more peaceful world. However, we cannot and should not give up. War and conflict have always imposed themselves onto societies. Today, however, the cost of war has made it a non-option. Thus, it is imperative to make long-lasting peace a reality. To that end, the Islamic Republic of Iran, as the main proponent of the idea of “A world against Violence and Extremism”, once again invites all peace-loving nations to close ranks for the cause of peace.
