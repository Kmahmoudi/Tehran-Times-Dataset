TEHRAN – The Iranian Ambassador to London, Hamid Baeidinejad, on Tuesday censured Washington’s veto of a UN Security Council resolution aimed at withdrawing recognition of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel by Donald Trump, saying the United States exhibited “unforgettable isolation” by the move. “Ambassador Nikki Haley exhibited unforgettable isolation of his [sic] country by veto of the resolution rejecting Trump's recent recognition of Al-Quds as capital of the Israeli regime,” Baeidinejad tweeted.  “UNGA will address the issue on December 21, expecting a major blow to Trump and US foreign policy,” he added.
