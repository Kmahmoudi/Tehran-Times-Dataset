TEHRAN – Iran’s Human Rights Council has rejected remarks by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as “untrue,” saying Iran’s human rights policy has fundamentally been premised upon “transparency as well as constructive and logical” cooperation.  At the 33rd session of the Human Rights Council on September 13, Ra’ad Hussein claimed Iran had “given no access” to his office since 2013.
“This is particularly regrettable given the reports we continue to receive of fundamental problems” with the situation of human rights in Iran, the UN official further said.
While rejecting the claim that Iran has been uncooperative since 2013, the Iranian human rights body has, inter alia, invited the UN High Commissioner to travel to Iran a number of times and held four rounds of negotiations with the international body.  
Tehran expects international rights officials to take the realities into account while addressing the human rights situation in different countries and avoid making “politically-motivated” statements by “adopting a professional and unbiased” approach, the Iranian human rights body said.
It also rejected the allegations that Tehran refuses to cooperate with the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights situation in Iran.
