TEHRAN- The agreement for the establishment of a free trade zone between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) is an opportunity for Iran to boost its exports to Russia, according to the Iranian head of Iran-Russia Joint Chamber of Commerce. Hadi Tizhoush-Taban said that the agreement also makes it possible to export some goods to Russia that are not already exported to that country, the website of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) reported. The head of Iran-Russia Joint Chamber of Commerce further commented that the chambers of commerce of Iran’s northern provinces can expand trade ties with Russia and lamented that Iran’s export to Russia is currently low. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has endorsed a much-awaited agreement for the establishment of a free trade zone between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) thus facilitating the process for the Islamic Republic to join the Moscow-led regional economic bloc. According to a Kremlin announcement, the agreement became a federal law after Putin’s endorsement and was accordingly forwarded to the relevant institutions to be implemented.   Apart from authorizing the creation of a free trade zone between Iran and the EU, the document would be meant to support their cooperation over a wide range of economic and commercial areas.
