According to a report by the World Bank, motorcycles are the second largest contributor to PM in Tehran, even before cars which greatly outnumber them.  One of the main reasons behind their high contribution to emissions is that a large part of the fuel consumed in motorcycles burns incompletely. The Tehran motorcycle fleet consists mostly of carburetor-equipped motorcycles which are typically less fuel efficient and emit more emissions compared to newer, fuel injection technology. On the other hand, motorcycles can contribute to road fatalities due to the low safety; motorcycle riders known as the highest contributors to road casualties holding a great share in the accidents happened in the country. According to the World Health Organization, almost half of all deaths on the world’s roads are among those with the least protection – motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians.
