TEHRAN – The judiciary system has approved a plan on promoting gender equality, the vice president for women’s and family affairs said, adding that the plan is communicated to all ministers in order to be considered in the budget law for the next Iranian calendar year 1398 (March 2019-March 2010). The major indicators of the plan were studied in different sessions held previously with different organizations, IRNA quoted Masoumeh Ebtekar as saying on Monday. However, at the national women's and family headquarters, the government adopted a resolution on gender equality indicators on the basis of which different meeting and gatherings were held, she added. The examples of indicators are in the education, employment, law, health and sports sectors, Ebtekar said adding sub-indicators and indicators are also foreseen, however, today all of our efforts is on implementing gender equality in general indicators. Girls’ presence at universities and higher education centers is mainly an indicator of implementing gender equality and today girls outnumber boys at Iranian universities, Ebtekar noted.  “Still there exist some gaps in achieving gender equality and we make attempts to remove them especially for girls deprived of education,” the official noted. There existed a significant lack of exercise for girls at elementary schools which is fortunately resolved, Ebtekar stated. Three resolutions were approved at the meetings of the headquarters for women’s and family affairs including identification, observation, and promotion of gender equality indicators, family planning before, during and after marriage and national programs for the promotion of women’s health, the VP explained.
