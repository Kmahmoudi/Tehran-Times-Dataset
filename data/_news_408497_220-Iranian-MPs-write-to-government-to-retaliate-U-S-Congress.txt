TEHRAN – 220 Iranian MPs on Tuesday signed a letter to the government which urged it to act in kind vis-à-vis what the U.S. Congress recently did against Iran.

 “We, members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly… would like to ask the government to act upon a law passed by the Majlis to take serious retaliatory measures on the JCPOA,” read the statement, IRIB reported. The Congress last week reinstated anti-Iran sanctions for another 10 years. SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
