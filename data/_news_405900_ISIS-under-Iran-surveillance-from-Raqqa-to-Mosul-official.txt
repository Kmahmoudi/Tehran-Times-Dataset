TEHRAN – Iran has been closely watching Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants from Syria to Iraq, a senior Iranian parliamentarian said, explaining how Iranian security forces thwart terrorists linked to the group from wreaking havoc inside the country.  “From the very moment they (ISIS members) are assigned missions against Iran in their bastions, be it in Raqqa, Syria to Mosul, Iraq, our security entities monitor them until arrested,” said Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of the parliament’s National Security And Foreign Policy Committee, on Monday.  Senior Iranian parliamentarian says, “From the very moment they (ISIS members) are assigned missions against Iran in their bastions in Raqqa in Syria to Mosul in Iraq, our security entities monitor them until arrested.”Iran has been helping the governments of Iraq and Syria to battle the extremist Islamic State group and other self-styled terrorist bands, which hold swathes of land across the Syrian and Iraqi territories. 
Being neighbor to Iraq to its west, the country has already dismantled ISIS-affiliated cells planning attacks within its territory, particularly over the past months.
Two weeks ago, Iranian forces clashed with one in Kermanshah, western Iran, killing four and arresting some more. 
Among the killed was Abu Aeshe Kurdi, a senior commander of the Daesh brigade in Mosul, Tehran announced later on. 
Also, in June Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi revealed Iranian security squads had thwarted a major jihadist plot to conduct bomb attacks in the capital Tehran and other parts of the country. 
Apart from security forces being on the lookout, a national watch has made it extremely difficult for plotters to plan sabotage inside the country, Alavi stressed.
“160 million eyes are watching the security of the country. So far the clues and information we have received from people have proven very effective,” he said.
