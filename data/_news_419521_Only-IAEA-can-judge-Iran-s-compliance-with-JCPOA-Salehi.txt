TEHRAN – Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Ali Akbar Salehi said on Tuesday that the International Atomic Energy Agency is the only official institution in charge of verifying Tehran’s compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. Salehi said the IAEA has verified nine times Tehran's adherence to its obligations under the deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Tasnim reported. He was reacting to U.S. President Donald Trump who has repeatedly said Iran was not in compliance with the JCPOA and accused Tehran of not “living up to the spirit” of the deal.
