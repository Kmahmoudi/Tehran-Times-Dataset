TEHRAN â€“ Some 24,000 students who live in single-parent and impoverished families in Tehran have been identified and benefactors will provide them with clothes for Noruz, the Iranian new year holidays, starting March 21, said Kamyab Sadri, the head of parenting and teaching society of Tehran affiliated to the Ministry of Education. Special vouchers will be given to these students so that they can get three clothing items from marketplaces which will be held accordingly, he added. He went on to say that last year they could provide 2,000 students with Noruz clothing. Just 31 days remain till the start of the new Iranian calendar year and its special celebrations known as Noruz. One of Iranian traditions in Noruz is that family members, especially children, wear new attire. This act of benefactors will certainly bring smile to the cute faces of those impoverished kids whose wishes are often too trivial and commonplace in the eyes of the majority.
