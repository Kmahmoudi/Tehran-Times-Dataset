TEHRAN – Rab’-e Rashidi is getting ready to host visitors as the first phase of a restoration project is nearing completion on the 14th-century educational complex in northwest Iran. Modification of landscape, construction of tourist routes, installation of guide signs, and reinforcement of neighboring structures are among measures that have so far been implemented, CHTN reported on Monday. Restoration is being carried out under close supervision of experts affiliated with the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, the report said. “The second phase will soon be followed by the first in late August.” Located in Tabriz, the capital of East Azarbaijan province, Rab’-e Rashidi was established during the reign of Ghazan, a ruler of the Ilkhanid dynasty. It embraces a paper factory, a library, a hospital (Dar-al-Shafa), a Quranic center (Dar-al-Quran), residential facilities for teachers, students’ quarters and a caravanserai amongst other facilities. The CHHTO keeps an eye on possible inscription of the site on the UNESCO World Heritage list by 2025.
