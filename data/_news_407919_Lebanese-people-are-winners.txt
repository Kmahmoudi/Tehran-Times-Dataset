TEHRAN - Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a special aide to Majlis speaker for international affairs, said on Tuesday that the Lebanese people are the actual “winners” as the Lebanese parliament on Monday voted to elect Michael Aoun as president.
 The post had been vacant since 2014 due to differences between rival factions in the country. Aoun has played an important role in resistance against the Zionist regime of Israel and his election bears an important message, Amir-Abdollahian said in a meeting with Hungarian Ambassador to Iran Janos Kovacs. Aoun, the former Lebanese army chief, was elected president by winning the support of 83 MPs, well above the absolute majority of 65 needed to win.   The Iranian Foreign Ministry congratulated on Monday election of Aoun as president, expressing hopes for increasing relations between Tehran and Beirut. Amir-Abdollahian also highlighted the importance of expanding relations between Iran and Hungary. Kovacs said that Hungary is willing to expand relations with Iran. NA/PA
