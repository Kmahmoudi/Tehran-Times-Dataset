TEHRAN – Es’haq Al-e- Habib, the Iranian deputy ambassador to the UN, said on Tuesday that the international community should put an end to the Israeli impunity against Palestinians and hold the regime accountable for its crimes.
 Al-e- Habib made the remarks during a speech at the UN Security Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question. Following is an excerpt of his speech published by IRNA: Palestine’s situation has deteriorated last year. More than 295 Palestinian civilians were brutally killed and over 29,000 were injured by Israel. Many of those killed and about 7,000 of those injured were under 18 years of age. This proves that Israel is a child-killer regime. This is a clear manifestation of war crimes and crime against humanity. Equally, in 2018, more Palestinian homes were demolished and more illegal Israeli settlements were built: the blatant violation of international law. There are yet new plans to demolish more Palestinian homes, to confiscate more Palestinian lands and to build more illegal Israeli settlements. This means the forced displacement of even more Palestinian families. “During its short life span, Israel has waged over 15 wars; occupied territories of Arab countries; invaded all of its neighbors, without exception; attacked other countries in the region and beyond from the Middle East to Africa; possessed all types of weapons of mass destruction; and the list goes on.” In 2018, by enacting a law to ensure Jewish supremacy over others, Israel legalized racism. Very recently, it inaugurated an apartheid highway that features a large concrete wall, one side of which is open to Israeli vehicles only and the other side to Palestinian vehicles only. Not surprising! Racism is in the very nature of the Israeli regime. First, they constructed a racial segregation wall, then enacted a racial discrimination law, and have now constructed an apartheid highway. Extremely shameful! This must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. We should also strongly reject and condemn the recognition of Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the Israeli capital, as well as the continued occupation of parts of Lebanon and the Syrian Golan by Israel. They are material breaches of international law and the relevant resolutions of this Council and the UNGA. Israel has been emboldened by impunity. Instead of facing punishment, it has been rewarded to continuously and brazenly commit all international crimes. That’s why, during its short life span, Israel has waged over 15 wars; occupied territories of Arab countries; invaded all of its neighbors, without exception; attacked other countries in the region and beyond from the Middle East to Africa; possessed all types of weapons of mass destruction; and the list goes on. Now, the only option is to put an end to such impunity through holding Israel accountable for their crimes against the Palestinians. This can ensure the application of law and deter its future violation. That is why we believe that the world should continue supporting the realization of Palestinian rights and reject further occupation, aggression, oppression, and intimidation. We will continue to do so.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
