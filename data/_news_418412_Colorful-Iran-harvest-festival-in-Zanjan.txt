Halla celebration, a harvest festival, is held annually in early autumn in Anguran region, northwestern province of Zanjan. Farmers in the region do not harvest 20 square meters of their wheat fields until the Halla celebration day. On the day, farmers invite a number of relatives and neighbors to lunch, most of them are farmers themselves. A special bread named ‘Nazik’ is baked for the guests and served after lunch. After eating lunch, all men go to the wheat fields and begin to harvest the remaining parts chanting prayers and repeat ‘Halla’ together. They take the wheat they harvest to their homes as a symbol of abundance. Various tribes and ethnic groups who live in different parts of Iran are just like colors, which make a great painting. Iran is home to about 20 ethnic groups who live in different regions of the country.
