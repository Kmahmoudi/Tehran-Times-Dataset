TEHRAN – The Chinese ambassador to Tehran on Wednesday said that his country adheres to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and continues to implement it. 
 The U.S. withdrawal from the deal has posed challenges to Tehran-Beijing ties but China will remain loyal to the international deal, said Pang Sen, entekhab.ir reported.  Ambassador Pang said China disagrees with imposing unilateral sanctions on a country that would be enforced by the so-called “long-arm jurisdiction”, which implies on the ability of local courts to exercise jurisdiction over foreign defendants.  He made the remarks in an address to the second conference of Iran–China cooperation within the framework of the Silk Road Economic Belt held in Tehran. The two countries have friendly relations and will maintain their routine business cooperation and this should not be criticized in any way, he added.  The envoy also attached great importance to the Tehran-Beijing cooperation, saying, “China is willing to deepen its relations with Iran.” “We can be sure that with [practicing] patience, we will certainly be able to overcome the ups and downs on the path of Tehran-Beijing relations.”  China is a party to the nuclear deal that Iran signed with great powers in July 2015. In May, Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and reimposed primary sanctions on Iran and secondary sanctions on the countries that do business with Tehran.
