TEHRAN - Mohsen Mohebi, head of the Presidential International Legal Center, said on Tuesday that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has demanded the U.S. not to take any new sanctions measures against Iran until the tribunal issues its verdicts on a lawsuit filed by the Islamic Republic against the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions.
 Mohebi said ICJ President Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday urging him not to take any new sanctions move. “Iran’s lawsuit is over the U.S. move in re-imposing unilateral sanctions which is against its international commitments under the 1955 agreement [the Treaty of Amity]. Based on the agreement, the U.S. was obliged to have fair behavior towards the Iranian citizens and not to impede banking interaction,” Mohebi stated. Head of the Presidential International Legal Center added that Iran had urged the ICJ to immediately ban re-imposition of sanctions. The first hearing session in the case will be held on August 27, the ICJ letter said. On July 16, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran had filed a complaint at the ICJ against the U.S. for reintroducing sanctions. “Today Iran filed a complaint @CIJ_ICJ to hold U.S. accountable for its unlawful re-imposition of unilateral sanctions. Iran is committed to the rule of law in the face of U.S. contempt for diplomacy & legal obligations. It’s imperative to counter its habit of violating int’l law,” Zarif tweeted. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and said sanctions will be restored against Iran. According to the U.S. Treasury, the first batch of sanctions will be snapped back on August 6 and the second batch on November 4. Iran and the U.S. signed the Treaty of Amity in 1955 which is still valid according to international law. The treaty consists of an introduction and twenty-three articles and emphasizes encouraging mutual trade and investments.
