TEHRAN – Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Tuesday that “we don’t know what type of person the North Korean leader is negotiating with”.
 “This person [U.S. President Donald Trump] is not a ‘wise representative’ of the U.S. We hope that the American nation will think about it,” he said at a press conference. Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong-un held a first summit in Singapore on Tuesday. Nobakht said President Trump could still scrap an agreement committing the U.S. to unspecified “security guarantees” in exchange for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. "It is not clear that he would not cancel the agreement before returning home." Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran last month.  NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
