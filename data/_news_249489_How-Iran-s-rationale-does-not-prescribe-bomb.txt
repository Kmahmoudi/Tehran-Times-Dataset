During an interview with Atlantic’s Jeffery Goldberg, John Kerry stated that “Iran has chosen not to pursue a bomb even when they had materials to build 10-12 of them”. This is in spite of a large spectrum of international relations theories which fail to explain Iran’s behavior, from balance of power to mutually assured destruction (MAD). Since the dawn of its creation, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been a source of bafflement for politicians and theoreticians alike. The unique worldview envisaged by the early revolutionaries once divided the world into the “oppressed” and “oppressing” countries. During that time and throughout the 1980s, everyone’s thought-frame was set into the “Eastern” and “Western” blocs. Now, after more than three decades later, the prevalent theories of IR are still unable to come up with an explanation for the Iranian Revolution. In the end it was Imam Khomeini’s vision which outlived and predicted the downfall of its preceding worldview, the bipolar system ceased to exist.
