A 10-point resolution, issued at the end of the protest rally in support of a global alliance for peace and protest against war, called on the U.S. leaders to stop beating the battle drum and to admit that the responsibility for making decision in this regard rests with the United Nations, and not to upset the peace seeking movement of the world. The resolution urged the UN to apply peaceful mechanisms for Iraq's disarmament and take more serious actions to guarantee Iraqi citizens' safety, IRNA reported. Iraqi and Afghan women too were reportedly among the Iranian protesters. A part of the resolution said "the chaotic" conditions prevailing in the region and the rise in hostile behaviors of the United States government have provided the Zionist regime with an opportunity to step up its violent racist attacks against the Palestinian women and children. "Therefore, while we call for a stop to the entrapment of the innocent Iraqi people in the flames of war, we also call for a global fight against the criminal acts of the Zionist regime," it said. The demonstrators called for adoption of the "development for peace" and "peace for development" initiatives, as the most suitable means for prevention of conflicts; encouragement of all governments to sign and ratify the rome statute (International Criminal Court) and step up campaigns for its recognition and understanding with an aim of checking crimes against humanity; and build-up attempts to support criminal prosecution of the offenders. The resolution requested for enhanced role of women and guaranteeing their effective presence in all national and international decision making bodies working for establishment of permanent peace. Furthermore, it called for urgent and effective action in accordance with international laws to curb adverse effects of economic restrictions on women and children. Considering the vital role of sustainable development in eliminating poverty worldwide, it is needed to cut military overspending and try to utilize military and industrial resources for peaceful purposes and social development. The final point of the resolution called for a campaign to encourage respect for cultural diversity and dialogue among civilizations so as to build up capacity of women and children and observe human rights and fundamental freedom for humanity. 
