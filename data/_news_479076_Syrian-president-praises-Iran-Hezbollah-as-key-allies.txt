TEHRAN- Bashar al-Assad, the President of Syria, has said that Lebanon's Hezbollah movement is seen as a vital ally of Damascus and that Iran is a significant backer of his country. Al-Assad made the comments during a three-hour talk on various topics with several Syrian experts and journalists, the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar reported on Friday. The president added that Tehran has consistently supported the Syria nation in its military and economic challenges. Iran provided advisory help to Syria in its war against terrorist groups, including Daesh. Assad also mentioned Damascus has backed Hezbollah and will continue to do so in the future, describing Syria and Hezbollah as “strategic partners”. The Syrian leader also voiced concern for Lebanon's future, noting that because the country is Syria's ally, its stability is crucial to the Damascus government. ‘Syria-Turkey talks may help restore ties’ On the talks between Syrian and Turkish officials, he said such negotiations are only for information-sharing that may help restore relationship. According to the Syrian president, Turkey has shown willingness to accept Syria's demands, so Damascus wants Ankara to take tangible measures rather than simply uttering words. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that a meeting with the Syrian counterpart is a possibility, suggesting that the two sides are close to mending fences after 11 years. Turkey has for the past 11 years backed armed groups that unsuccessfully sought to topple the Assad government, with Erdogan even calling him a "murderer". Asked by a reporter in the parliament whether he could meet with the Syrian leader, Erdogan said “it is possible”. "It's possible. There's no room for resentment in politics. Ultimately, steps are taken under the most favorable conditions,” the Turkish leader said, according to Press TV. ‘Syria in talks with Kurdish troops’  Assad also pointed to the negotiations between with Syrian Kurdish troops in northern Syria on services and livelihood matters. However, he said the talks with the Syrian Democratic Forces are more of a tribal connection and haven't resulted in any progress so far. ‘No contact with U.S.’ Regarding relations with the United States, he said that the Syrian government had no contact with American officials. Instead, he said, Damascus is concentrating on strengthening the Syrian people's resistance to press the American troops to leave the country's occupied territory. Press TV said a military facility occupied by U.S. forces in Syria’s northeastern province of Hasakah has come under rockets attack from nearby areas amid public rage over presence of American occupation troops in energy-rich regions of Syria and attempts by the U.S. to further loot natural resources there. The U.S. military’s Central Command (CENTCOM), which oversees American troops in West Asia, said in a short statement that the rockets were launched at around 10:31 p.m. local time (1931 GMT) on Friday, and targeted the U.S. patrol base in al-Shaddadi town. It added that the projectiles failed to impact anything inside the base. He also said Russia has been of great assistance to Syria, but the current scenario is different as a result of Russia's military activity in Ukraine, as well as economic and military pressures on them. Based on his remarks, Syria and Iraq have friendly relations and Damascus relies on the Iraq’s overall policy rather than individual positions.
