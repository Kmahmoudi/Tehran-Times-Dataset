TEHRAN – Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday the U.S. has put forward totally unacceptable demands to Iran, criticizing the U.S. government for its policy of “ultimatums” and “threats” towards Iran.

 “A campaign against Iran has been gaining momentum in the U.S. as Washington has clearly opted for the policy of ultimatums and threats towards Iran,” she said.  “We have never supported the policy of unilateral sanctions and will never do that as we believe them to be illegal. We are determined to advance our comprehensive cooperation with Iran,” she added. MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
