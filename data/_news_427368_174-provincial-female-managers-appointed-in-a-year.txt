TEHRAN – A number of 174 women were appointed in managerial positions in different levels over the past year, Masoumeh Ebtekar, vice president for women’s and family affairs, said here on Wednesday. Although the number of appointed female managers is a good sign of development, but there is still a large distance to met the target set by the administration of entrusting women with 30 percent of managerial positions, IRNA quoted Ebtekar as saying. Women make up 9 percent of managers in business and service workshops, statistics released by the Statistical Center of Iran in the calendar year 1394 (March 2015- March 2016) shows. Female managers hold a maximum 50 percent share of training workshops, the center said, Mehr news agency reported.
