TEHRAN – Representatives of Iran’s religious minorities in the parliament on Tuesday censured U.S. for designating the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization, saying the move showed the American regime’s animosity toward the Iranian nation. They made the remarks in a statement which was read out at the end of the Tuesday session of the parliament, Mehr reported. “The official declaration of animosity by the Arrogance (America) toward this popular institution, while all of its facilities are at the disposal of the victims of the floods, shows the animosity of the American regime toward all Iranian people,” the statement read.
