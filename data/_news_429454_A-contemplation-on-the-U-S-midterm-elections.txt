TEHRAN - Referring to the Republican's partial victory in the Senate (which was quite predictable from the beginning), Donald Trump, president of the United States, has cheered over his great victory in the U.S. midterm elections! Democrats, on the other hand, claim victory for midterm elections based on their win in the House of Representatives, which has temporarily put an end to the Republican's dominance on this collection.  Apart from the fact that which Party had really won the recent election, there are some points about the Congress elections and its consequences on the U.S. domestic and foreign policy that should be taken into consideration:  Firstly, we should note that even if Democrats could win both the Senate and the House of Representatives, no specific difference was supposed to take place in the U.S. foreign policy! Everyone remembers that in 2008, Barack Obama, through his false emphasis on the slogan of "change", managed to win the Republican Party and John McCain and find way to the White House.  At that time, Obama's senior advisers, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, a prominent American strategist, stressed that it's really difficult, and in some cases impossible, to bring changes to the US foreign policy. This rule was true for Iran as well.  During Obama's presidency, we saw the most outrageous, multilateral and unilateral sanctions against our country. This was while organizing and implementation of these sanctions were all done by the American Democrats; and those same Democrats are now standing against Trump and his foreign policy. Secondly, the U.S. constitution easily let the country's president make use of his veto power over the congress. Even in some cases, the president can impose his own views on other organs. However, losing the seats in the House of Representatives to the Democrats, has a clear message for the American Republicans: that a significant part of the American society has been turned away from the "Trupism". Now Democrats have more incentives to prepare themselves to compete with Trump in the 2020 presidential election, based on victory in the House of Representatives. The third point is that the Islamic Republic of Iran hasn't basically counted on the U.S. midterm elections results. Neither the victory nor the failure of one of the two traditional American parties could change the American authorities' policies towards our country. The hostility of the U.S. Democrats and Republicans to our nation, and the vicious and extensive efforts of the two to confront the foundations of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, have been proven to all.  In this equation, there's no difference between Jimmy Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, Obama, and Trump. The United States midterm elections were merely a reflection of the anarchy which rules over the American political system. The deprivation of millions of Americans from voting in the Congress elections, and the deliberate destruction of voting systems in 12 U.S. states, had well depicted the concept of American democracy!  These events should be analyzed in the context of the unfair American electoral structure. It's not to be forgotten that in the 2016 presidential election, Trump could enter the White House, although he had three million votes less than his rival, and this happened based on the unfair Electoral College! In other words, in the United States, the rule of "every citizen has one vote" is replaced by "hidden games" which are played and directed by the American politicians. This is the fact that challenges the decorated but absurd concept of American democracy. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
