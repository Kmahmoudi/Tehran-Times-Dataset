TEHRAN – Muhammad Abdusalam, the spokesman for the Yemeni Ansarullah, held talks in Tehran on Monday with Hossein Jaberi Ansari, the special assistant to the Iranian foreign minister, discussing ways to settle the Yemen war politically.

 The two sides exchanged views how to end the cruel war on the Yemeni people. In a similar meeting with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday, Abdusalam presented a report on the current situation in Yemen, especially on the chaotic humanitarian situation.  Millions of people have been pushed to starvation and at least 13,600 have been killed since the onset of the Saudi-led military campaign against Yemen in March 2015.
