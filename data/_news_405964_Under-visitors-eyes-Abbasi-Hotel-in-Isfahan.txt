TEHRAN - The extensively renovated Abbasi Hotel located in downtown Isfahan was once the Safavid-era caravanserai of the Madraseh-ye Chahar Bagh.  
 Facilities include a delightful traditional teahouse, a welcoming coffee shop, a business center and an indoor pool, sauna and gym. One of the most desired destinations in the country, Isfahan is a living museum of traditional culture and home to a wide range of magnificent Islamic structures.
Following is some comments posted to tripadvisor.com by a number of visitors to the time-honored hotel: “Not what I had in mind”
We stayed in this hotel’s first floor, it was absolutely gorgeous and I would’ve recommended it to anyone visiting Isfahan… (Lemoclemo from Kuwait, stayed August 2016) “First in class with excellent location”
Luxury and opulence - come to be pampered and admire the beautiful hallways and décor, the Abbasi Hotel is located in heart of Isfahan… (Jeffrey H. from Walnut, California, stayed July 2016) “Luxury hotel”
The facilities are excellent! The room was clean and the staff was very helpful. There is a beautiful garden and a luxury restaurant where to have dinner. The breakfast was not so good compared to other cheaper hotels in Iran. (Cmolinuevo from San Sebastian, Spain, stayed December 2015) “Iran’s landmark hotel”
This world class hotel is Isfahan’s and quite possibly Iran’s most luxurious hotel. This hotel is absolutely gorgeous, from the multi-level reception area, the enormous central courtyard, and the hand painted flowers and birds on the walls.  (Izedtravel101 from Boston, Massachusetts, stayed August 2016) AFM/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
