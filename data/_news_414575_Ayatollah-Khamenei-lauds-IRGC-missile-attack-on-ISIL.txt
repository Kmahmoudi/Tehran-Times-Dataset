TEHRAN - Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday praised the IRGC’s powerful missile attacks on ISIL in Syria as well as the massive rallies on Quds Day and huge turnout in the May 19 presidential elections, saying these are  all “valuable  social assets” which are the source of honor and hope. On June 18, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps fired six surface-to surface missiles at Islamic State targets in Syria in retaliation for the terrorist group’s deadly attacks in Tehran. The missiles were launched from Iran’s western bases at ISIL command centers, logistic sites and suicide car bomb factories in Syria’s eastern Deir al Zour area.
