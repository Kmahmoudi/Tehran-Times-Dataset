TEHRAN _ Britain was a staunch supporter and main follower of the White House during Obama presidency in imposition of tough nuclear sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran. In an exclusive interview with UK-based “Daily Telegraph”, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson emphasized “U.S. is still considered a part of JCPOA, so that suspension of sanctions has been continued and this is very significant issue that should be taken into serious consideration.” Now, it is likely that U.S. Congress may rip off the JCPOA, he said, adding “I believe it is unlikely that U.S. will ditch the nuclear deal.” “We will make our utmost effort to convince our colleagues and allies to live up to their commitments within the framework of JCPOA, because, JCPOA is a valuable and comprehensive pact,” he observed. Most representatives at the U.S. Congress tend to modify and correct irregularities in JCPOA, so that this comprehensive plan will not be lifted by the U.S. government, British foreign secretary stressed. Currently, UK officials should clarify this issue both for Iranian and international audiences completely whether Iran’s nuclear deal is controversial or valuable? Elsewhere in his remarks, he said “JCPOA should not be neglected and ignored by the British foreign diplomacy, so that the British government has shown green light to the U.S. Congress on modifying or correcting irregularities in JCPOA.” Over the past two years, British authorities have announced their full support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action but in practice, they have breached their commitments in some cases in tandem with the United States of America. For example, UK Foreign Ministry in a statement has called Iran as a controversial hub for the business transactions. Currently, Boris Johnson is missioned to showcase the issue of “Iran’s nuclear deal, JCPOA” as ordinary in order to render services to the authorities in Trump Administration. After that, Boris Johnson along with U.S. authorities will try to consider Iran’s opposition with renegotiation of nuclear deal under the title of an “Unusual Objection".
Under such circumstance, it is obvious that Iranian Foreign Ministry should be vigilant and careful of UK role on Iran’s nuclear deal. Undoubtedly, the role of UK authorities will be more complicated in coming days particularly at the threshold of final decision of representatives at the U.S. Congress on JCPOA.
