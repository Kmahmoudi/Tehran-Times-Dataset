TEHRAN - In the wake of ongoing peace talks between various stakeholders in Afghanistan and the Afghan Taliban, India is preparing for any eventuality by being in touch with key political stakeholders in the country. According to a report in Economic Times, quoting a senior government official, New Delhi, which has made massive investments in the war-ravaged country, is keeping in regular touch with stakeholders in Afghanistan and other nations including key regional powers that want stability there. The entire Afghan political leadership, including former president Hamid Karzai, is holding consultations with India regarding future of their country, the report states. “India will not be caught off guard. While the future of Afghan situation is a key item on the agenda of Indo-US ties, the government is in touch with Moscow as well as Tehran, with both having vital interests in the landlocked country. Besides, India is in consultation with China and has launched a capacity building project for Afghan diplomats,” the report quotes a source saying. Rising terror attacks in Afghanistan is a worry for both Russia and Iran and such phenomenon will have spillover impact across Afghan boundaries. The functioning of Chabahar Port, whose operations are run by India, serves the purpose of Afghanistan as well as the Eurasian nations that have high stakes in Afghanistan, it adds. The situation in Afghanistan, it further adds, will be on the agenda when the foreign ministers of Russia, India and China meet in Shanghai later this month.
