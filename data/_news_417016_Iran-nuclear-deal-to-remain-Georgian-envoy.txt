TEHRAN – The Iran nuclear deal is an international agreement that is good for all the parties and will be preserved, Georgia's envoy to Tehran has predicted in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump’s claims.
 Speaking to IRNA on Friday, Loseb Chakhvashvili said that the reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency verifying Iran's compliance with the agreement are of high significance. “The IAEA has always published positive reports on Iran’s nuclear activities, so, the international community would be on Iran’s side.” SP/PA
