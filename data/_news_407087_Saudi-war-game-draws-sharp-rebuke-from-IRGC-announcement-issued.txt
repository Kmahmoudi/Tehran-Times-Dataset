TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy issued an announcement on Wednesday vowing prompt response to any movement by the Saudi military and other fleets near the Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf.  The announcement comes right on the heels a drill, starting on Tuesday, by the Royal Saudi Navy Forces in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and the Sea of Oman.  “The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy and Iran’s Navy are in full preparation to provide stable security in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, and will take prompt and proper counteraction to every movement, attempt, and action aimed at destabilizing the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and the Sea of Oman,” read part of the announcement.  Over the past five years, Iran and Saudi Arabia, two Middle East archrivals, have been at loggerheads over a list of regional issues, including the backing opposing sides in the Syrian crisis.  Mutual animosity has escalated ever since last January when Saudi Arabia severed off all political ties with Tehran, triggered by the execution of pro-democracy Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr.  “The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps declares to all frigates which are participating in the announced Saudi Arabia’s war game, including all frigates of the Saudi Navy and all other ones, that it strongly believes the drill is a clear instance of creating tension and making the Persian Gulf less secure,” read another part of the communique.  The IRGC also has warned the Saudi Navy against nearing the Iranian territorial waters and even “the international waters near the territorial waters of Iran.”  “…we (IRGC Navy) announce that such transit will be by no means a harmless one.”  Recently, Iran announced it has evidence the Saudis are behind the recent border intrusions by terrorist groups in western parts of Iran.  The two regional powerhouses also have differences over what is going on in Yemen, Lebanon, and Iraq.  To these one has to add the hajj crush in 2015 during which at least 460 Iranian pilgrims lost their lives.  Riyadh has paid no compensations to the families of the Iranian victims.  Having said that, the last Iranian ambassador to Saudi Arabia believes bilateral ties still can be saved though with difficulty.  “Of course, due to what has happened so far, revival of ties has got more difficult. Yet it is not impossible,” said Hossein Sadeqi told ISNA.
