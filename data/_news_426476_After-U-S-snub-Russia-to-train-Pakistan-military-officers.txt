TEHRAN - After the Donald Trump administration decided to cut down training and educational programs of Pakistani military officers, Russia has filled that space, much to the chagrin of hawks in Washington. Moscow and Islamabad signed an agreement for training of Pakistani military officers, which coincided with the news about U.S. cutting down its training and educational programs that had been a cornerstone of military ties between the two countries for more than a decade. According to observers, the move is likely to further damage relations between Washington and Islamabad as the U.S. and Russia share bitter rivalry. The suspension of Pakistan from the U.S. government’s International Military Education and Training program (IMET) will close off places that had been set aside for 66 Pakistani officers this year, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters.   The cut in training program is likely to have little impact on Pakistan as it has already shifted its focus on military needs towards Russia and China, believe observers. Pakistani Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, who is also chairman of the Foreign Affairs committee, was quoted by media saying that the step taken by the U.S. was “wrong and counterproductive.” The US is repeating past mistakes through failed policy of trying to bully and browbeat Pakistan with such short-sighted sanctions, he remarked. According to reports, Pakistan has also been removed from programs at the US Naval War College, Naval Staff College and courses including cyber security studies.
