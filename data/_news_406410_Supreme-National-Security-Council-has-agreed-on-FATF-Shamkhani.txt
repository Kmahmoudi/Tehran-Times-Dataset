TEHRAN – The Supreme National Security Council has reached an agreement on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the decision is awaiting a confirmation by the Supreme Leader, the SNSC Secretary Ali Shamkhani said on Wednesday.  On whether there is a positive view toward the implementation of the FATF, he said the decisions by the council are implemented only when they are “signed” and “confirmed” by the Supreme Leader and since it has not yet been approved by the Leader “I cannot say anything in this regard.” The SNSC chief also dismissed media reports that he is scheduled to go to Majlis on Saturday to explain the FATF to MPS.  “I have not heard such thing,” he told reporters. When asked isn’t it necessarily that the treaty be approved by the Majlis, he said, “I cannot give technical views.”  However, he added, if there is much backing for the treaty “there will be less problems in the future”. Shamkhani also said the approval of the FATF by the SNSC is definitely in line with “national interests”, saying anything other than this cannot be imagined.
