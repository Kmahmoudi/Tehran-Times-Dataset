TEHRAN- The chief executive of Austrian energy group OMV said on Thursday that talks with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) on settling outstanding claims which have hindered OMV from investing more in the country were almost finished. Rainer Seele said: "We are in the end phase of negotiations between NIOC and OMV, therefore I don't want to comment too much in detail. All I can say is we would like to finish these negotiations as early as possible," Reuters quoted the chief executive of the group as saying in a presentation broadcast online.
OMV has not disclosed how much it wants Iran to pay, but Seele has indicated it is a significant amount.
NIOC’s Managing Director Ali Kardor had previously said that his company is in talks with OMV for selling 40,000 barrels per day of crude oil to the company.
He said part of the deliveries will be as payback for OMV’s exploration activities in Iran a decade ago.
“The two sides are finalizing the terms of the contract,” he added.  MA/MG
