TEHRAN- India has started its commercial activities in Iran’s southeastern port of Chabahar, the Indian government said on Monday, Economic Times reported.

Then during the visit of the Iranian president to India in February 2018, the lease contract for Shahid Beheshti Port-Phase 1 was signed between Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization (PMO) and India’s Ports Global Limited (IPGL). India then inaugurated a headquarters called India Ports Global Chabahar Free Zone (IPGCFZ) at the port to help it commit to its part in the accord. India’s Shipping Ministry said in its Monday statement that commercial operations had begun at the IPGCFZ with the arrival of a Cyprus registered bulk carrier bearing 72,458 million tons of corn at the port on December 30, The Times of India reported. The vessel MV Macheras discharged the cargo, which had been imported from Brazil, the statement added. “This is the first time India will be operating a port outside its territories," the Ministry pointed out. “India is to equip and operate two berths in Chabahar Port Phase-I with capital investment of $85.21 million and annual revenue expenditure of $22.95 million on a 10-year lease,” the paper added.
