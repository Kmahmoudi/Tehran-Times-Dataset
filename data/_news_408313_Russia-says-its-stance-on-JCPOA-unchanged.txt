Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Monday that Moscow’s stance on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the official for the Iran nuclear deal, has not changed.
 “We believe that the agreement of the ‘six’ [5+1 group] with Iran is balanced and represents a significant contribution to strengthening international security. Our assessment has not changed,” Sputnik quoted Ryabkov as saying. Donald Trump, the U.S. president-elect, had raised the prospect that the U.S. would pull out of the nuclear deal struck between Iran and great powers including the United States. However, later he toned down his rhetoric by saying he had never said he would “rip up” the deal but “police that contract so tough they don’t have a chance…” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday that the U.S. should “fulfil its commitments in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as a multilateral international agreement”. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini also said on Wednesday that the JCPOA is a “multilateral agreement” and that she is tasked to guarantee its full implementation. Iran and the six major powers (the U.S., Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany) reached the nuclear deal in July 2015 and the agreement went into effect in January 2016.
