TEHRAN – Hossein Jaberi Ansari, a senior assistant to the Iranian foreign minister, has said the aim of his recent visit to Moscow was to find ways to put an end to the Saudi-led war on Yemen. “In this trip we tried to reach a framework between Iran and Russia for talks about Yemen,” Jaberi Ansari said, Mehr reported on Friday. On talks with four European countries and the European Union in general, he said, “The aim of these consultations is to find a solution to help Yemen out of the current conflict, in a way that warmongers can find a way out of their self-made crisis through the window of peace.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
