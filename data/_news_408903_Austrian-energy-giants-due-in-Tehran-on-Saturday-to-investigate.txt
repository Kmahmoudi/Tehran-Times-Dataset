TEHRAN- Austria’s OMV along with some other leading energy companies of the country will arrive in Tehran on Saturday to participate in Iran-Austria Joint Energy Committee meeting for investigating the two countries’ energy cooperation roadmap. Jochen Penker, the director of European and international energy policy at the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy and Amir-Hossein Zamaninia, the Iranian deputy oil minister for international and trade affairs, will co-chair the committee meeting. Optimizing fuel consumption, investing in the oil and gas projects, environmental issues and gas exports to Europe are among the subjects to be discussed in the gathering. OMV said in mid September that it had received 1 million barrels of crude oil from Iran in a spot delivery at the Italian port of Trieste which the energy group would send to its two refineries in Austria and Romania. According to Reuters, The delivery was Iran's first to OMV since 2012, when sanctions were imposed on the country. OMV is in talks with Iran about future deliveries, although no such contract has been signed yet, a spokesman said at the time. The delivery included Iranian heavy and light crude, he added. OMV has been present in Iran since 2001 when it implemented operations at the Mehr exploration basin in the western part of the country, which became the first contract of the company with Iran, Trend reported. The Austrian Company earlier signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) as it looked to revive its activities in Iran. The deal covered several areas ranging from oil and gas field evaluation to crude oil and petroleum product swaps.
