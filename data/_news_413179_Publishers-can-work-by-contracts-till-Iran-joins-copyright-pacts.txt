TEHRAN – Association of Italian Publishers (AIE) director Alfieri Lorenzon has proposed that Iranian and Italian publishing companies collaborate based on mutual agreements until Iran is admitted as a member of the international conventions on copyrights. Speaking to the Tehran Times at the 30th Tehran International Book Fair on Friday, he said that restrictions prevent international publishers from collaboration with Iran since the country Iran does not hold a membership in any international copyright conventions.  He added that the Tehran book fair can provide a good opportunity for publishers to work out the necessary agreements for collaboration.  “Obviously we prefer a normal way to have relations. For example, if we go to the book fairs in Frankfurt, London or Bologna, we have normal relations and we can manage the rights, but I think if two different publishers find an agreement here at this fair, that is positive,” he added. “However, the Iranian market could be managed with some new programs, that is, we invite the Italian publishers and they will have meetings with Iranian publishers. We have a lot of publishers specializing in children’s, scientific and educational books. The agreements would be a positive result of the fair,” he said. Lorenzon explained that AIE has managed the presence of the Italian authors and publishers at the fair. “We have several publishers who have held meetings with different Iranian publishers or institutions at the fair,” he said. “However we organize the general presence but not the business agenda of the publishers, and we actually try to discover a new world here in this fair.” He also said, “We do not have much knowledge about the book market in Iran and we are here to find out more about the publication industry of Iran and its potentials.” Protection of copyrights, enhancement of Italian publishing at home and abroad, development of digital publishing, and promotion of reading, are among the priorities of the AIE. Also visiting the fair, Paola Seghi, the manager of AIE Exhibitions, Events and Training Courses, gave some details about the programs of her country as the guest of honor. “We brought here some 13 authors to the fair, as well as different kinds of books. We have organized meetings with the authors each day during the fair. We have an Italian and an Iranian counterpart in each meeting, it is a kind of dialogue between Iranian and Italian speakers about special issues such as art, history and poetry,” she added. Lorenzon said that the AIE tried to connect Iranian and Italian literati and writers together in order to work in close collaboration on translation. “The program is very profound. We discussed a lot of things from sports to poetry, from history to children and novels. And every meeting is a link to start cooperation, it is a new way to present our books and our culture,” he asserted.  Lorenzon also said called the Tehran book fair a large event and added, “They have increased the space and the publishers are staying in different spaces. More space and more people. It is far from the town but has brought many people to the fair.” For her part, Paola also said that she has been impressed by the number of visitors.  27 Italian publishing firms have been invited to attend the fair. They include Alma Edizioni, Armando Publishing House, Bompiani, Francesco Brioschi Editore and Dami International. The fair will be running until May 13 at the Shahr-e Aftab Fairground.
