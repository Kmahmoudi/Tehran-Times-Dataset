TEHRAN - On Tuesday, the Romanian embassy celebrated its National Day, also known as Great Union Day, in Tehran. Each year on December 1st, Romanians celebrate the unification of Romanian provinces, a day that is observed as an annual public holiday throughout the country. Speaking before a group of diplomatic corps, the Romanian Ambassador to Tehran, Adrian Kozjacski, highlighted the traditional and historical ties between Iran and Romania. Ambassador Kozjacski also said the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, has prepared the ground for expansion of relations between Iran and Romania in agriculture, transportation, tourism, energy, and telecommunications and so on. Since the beginning of 2016, there have been cross-visits by high government officials of the two countries as well as bilateral political consultations at the level of deputy chiefs, the ambassador added. The ambassador said the “joint economic commissions” are of high importance for development of economic relations. To do so, the envoy added, a team of Iranian experts and their Romanian counterparts met and held talks on trade and business in Bucharest this year. He held out hope that with the upcoming parliamentary election in Romania, political talks are held at higher levels so that “we witness further expansion of economic and bilateral relations.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
