TEHRAN – U.S. President Donald Trump defended on Saturday his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, claiming that the American forces are killing ISIS for Russia and Iran “that are not necessarily in agreement with us.” “Who are we killing ISIS for? You know, the worst enemy of Russia, Iran, Syria is ISIS. We are killing ISIS for people that are not necessarily in agreement with us, let's put it that way. We have gone into Syria, and in two years, we have reduced it to about 99 percent of the territorial caliphate,” Trump said, Washington Examiner reported.
