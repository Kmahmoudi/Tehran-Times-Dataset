TEHRAN — The Iranian Army’s Aerial Division on Wednesday unveiled an upgraded version of the Shahab training drone.
 The drone has the ability to identify targets, possesses a flight height of 11,000 feet and its flight duration is eight hours, the officials declared. The flight radius of the UAV which is meticulously designed for training activities is 10 km, although it has the ability to increase the flight radius for the reconnaissance mission at a range of 200 km. The Shahab training drone is an upgraded version of Safir, according to media reports.  This UAV is built according to training activities and therefore possesses special aerodynamic capabilities, as well as a strong structure. The landing gear of the UAV is designed in a way that it repels the incoming force during landing and does not allow it to be transferred to the structure, which facilitates the landing task for training pilots. On the other hand, it improves the safety level of the structure during landing. Also, in order to maintain the balance of the drone during flight, landing and takeoff, the end of its fin is designed as a “V” shape.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
