TEHRAN- Iran’s crude oil exports reached 2.135 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, a 9.3 rise from its previous month, Oilprice.com reported citing energy data provider Kpler. According to the report, Iranian crude oil exports rose by 182,000 bpd in August from July.  The increases came at a time when most of the OPEC members cut their daily crude exports. Based on the data provided by Kpler, Iran and Nigeria had the highest exports rate among OPEC members in the mentioned month.  After the implementation of the nuclear accord (called JCPOA) in January 2016, Iran has been seeking to expand its target markets. Since then, oil exports to Europe have risen by more than 300 percent. Also, according to the latest data released by Reuters, Iranian crude oil production increased by 100,000 bpd in August from July. Exempted from the OPEC, non-OPEC curbs, Iran has increased its crude output to 3.79 million bpd in August from 3.78 million bpd in July.
