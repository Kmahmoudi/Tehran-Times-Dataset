TEHRAN - Behrooz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said on Saturday that there will be no change to the Fordow nuclear plant as long as the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is preserved.
 “Fordow will remain in this way as long as the JCPOA is preserved, however, we will have plans for Fordow if we exit the JCPOA,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony. Commenting on preparations to increase uranium enrichment capacity up to a level of 190,000 SWUs (separative work units), Kamalvandi said, “190,000 SWUs is the least of our need in industrial enrichment which is enough for one power plant and our research reactors.” Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on June 4 ordered the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) to take rapid steps to increase uranium enrichment capacities “up to a level of 190,000 SWUs for the time being within the framework of the JCPOA”  if the nuclear agreement falls apart. Kamalvandi said, “We take actions based on orders of the system’s officials, and for the time being the Leader’s view is being materialized within the framework of the JCPOA. We will announce the country’s actual capacities if we exit the JCPOA.” On May 8, U.S. President Donald Trump officially withdrew from the UN-endorsed nuclear agreement and plans to reimpose sanctions on Iran. After the U.S. withdrawal, Iran wants assurances from the remaining parties that its interests are guaranteed or it will resume nuclear activities with a higher speed. Since the 2015 nuclear agreement went into force in January 2016, the International Atomic Energy Agency has issued 11 reports each time confirming that Iran is abiding by the terms of the agreement.
