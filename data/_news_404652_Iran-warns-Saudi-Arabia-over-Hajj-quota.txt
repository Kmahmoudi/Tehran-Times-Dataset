TEHRAN – Saudi Arabia does not have the right to reallocate Iran’s Hajj quota to other countries, the head of Iran’s Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization said on Sunday, Press TV reported.

 “The Organization of Islamic Cooperation determines the Hajj quota of Muslim countries. So, Saudi Arabia has no right at all to reallocate this quota, as a legitimate right of the Iranian people of which they have been deprived due to the negligence of the Saudi government, to other countries,” Saeed Ohadi said. “The Islamic Republic of Iran will definitely demand this legitimate right from Saudi Arabia during next year’s Hajj season,” he added.
