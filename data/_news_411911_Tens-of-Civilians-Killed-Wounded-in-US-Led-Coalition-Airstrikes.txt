TEHRAN - At least 22 civilians were killed and many more were wounded in the US-led collation air raids in Raqqa and Aleppo provinces, media sources said. The Arabic language al-Arabi al-Jadid news website reported that at least 17 civilians, including children and women, were killed and 15 others were injured in the US-led coalition air raids in Kasarat village South of Raqqa city. The website added that the warplanes' combat flights over two villages in Eastern Aleppo left five civilians dead and 11 more wounded. In relevant developments on Tuesday, 18 civilians, including women and children, were killed in US-led collation airstrikes in Raqqa's countryside in Northeastern Syria. 18 Syrian civilians, including six children under the age of six and four women were killed and several more were wounded in the US-led coalition fighter jets' raids in al-Matab town in the Eastern countryside of Raqqa. The US army had previously claimed that only 220 civilians were killed in the air attacks of the coalition under its command in Syria and Iraq in 2014. The US command also noted that it could not investigate all reports of possible civilian casualties using “traditional investigative methods,” which involves interviewing witnesses and examining the site of the strike. Instead, the coalition interviewed pilots and servicemen that took part in combat missions to draw results. The US command also reviewed strike surveillance videos and analyzed government and non-governmental organizations’ traditional and social media content. In the meantime, Iraq Body Count's website disclosed that 2,316 civilians were killed in air raids of the so-called anti-ISIL coalition only in Iraq since September1, 2014 till September1, 2016. The US army declared estimates of 220 casualties fall far below the number voiced by some monitoring groups. The Airwars monitoring group, reckoned that at least 2,463 civilians have been killed by coalition air strikes. Amnesty International’s figures sharply contradict Washington’s assessment as well. “We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,” said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International’s Beirut regional office.
