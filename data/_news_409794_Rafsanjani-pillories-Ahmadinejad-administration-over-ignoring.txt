TEHRAN – Expediency Council Chairman Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani censured on Wednesday the Ahmadinejad administration for playing down the role of the people in making things happen differently.   “Very proper policies were drafted so as to get the people more engaged in the country’s affairs, but these were implemented in practice by a government that openly announced it had no belief in such issues,” Rafsanjani said. Rafsanjani was making the comments at a meeting with members of a board in charge of implementing general policies of the resistance economy.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
