TEHRAN – With the aim of facilitating data transfer and connection to regional network operators, an international gateway (IGW) development project was inaugurated in Tehran on Monday. Information and Communications Technology Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi attended the inauguration ceremony, which was held to observe World Telecommunication and Information Society Day, May 17, which is annually celebrated worldwide, Mehr reported. The project meet the demands of network operators for increasing bandwidth and providing network infrastructure to facilitate data transfer. Providing 2.4 Tbit international internet bandwidth and bandwidth distribution in seven centers are some of the achievements of the project. On Monday, Azari Jahromi also attended the opening ceremony of a network operations center (NOC), in which network monitoring and control, or network management, is done over a telecommunication network.  During the ceremony, Jahromi said that seven months ago only 35 percent of Iran’s villages were connected to telecommunication network, which has increased to 55 percent recently. “Many citizens are waiting for landline telephone in some cities in Iran while fourth generation of broadband cellular network, 4G, is available in those places,” he said. “Hence, we can benefit from capacities of 4G network instead of using copper wire,” he added.
