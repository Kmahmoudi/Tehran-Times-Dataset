TEHRAN - In an indication of another simmering trade war between the United States and India, U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged that India is a very high-tariff nation Addressing the conservative political action conference (CPAC) in Washington DC on Saturday, Trump said he wants a reciprocal tax or at least some kind of tax. “India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot,” Trump was quoted as saying. He touched upon a wide range of issues including domestic, global and bilateral relationship with countries like India. Referring to his often-cited example of the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles, he said, “When we send a motorcycle to India, it is a hundred per cent tariff. They charge 100 per cent when India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing.” “So, I want a reciprocal tax or at least, I want to charge a tax. It's called the mirror tax, but it's reciprocal,” Trump asserted. Trump, however, said there was resistance to his move from the Senate. “I say, fellows, listen, they are charging us a hundred per cent. For the exact same product, I want to charge them 25 per cent. I feel so foolish charging 25, because it should be a hundred. But I'm doing 25 only because of you. I want to get your support,” he said. There was no official reaction from India yet. However, the two sides have recently been engaged in tariff war, with India retaliating with its own tariffs on U.S. goods following U.S. move.
