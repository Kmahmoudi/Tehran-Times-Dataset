TEHRAN – Economy Minister Farhad Dejpasand on Saturday slammed new U.S. sanctions against Iran, saying the Islamic Republic has become “highly experienced” in circumventing the economic sanctions. Speaking to reporters in Tehran, Dejpasand said “appropriate plans” have been devised to counter Washington’s economic sanctions against Tehran, Tasnim reported. “We will use all opportunities to counter the enemy in the field of economy,” he added. The second batch of U.S. sanctions on Tehran took effect on Monday, months after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the 2015 nuclear deal and ordered the reimposition of sanctions against Iran.
