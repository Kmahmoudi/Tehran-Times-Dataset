TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that mass participation in the elections will create a “security shield” for the country.
 “People’s presence will keep away many threats and dangers against Iran,” he said in a meeting in Qom, the city he represents in the parliament. Given the fact that many other countries seek to undermine Iran it is important to turn out in election in large numbers, the senior lawmaker noted. Larijani also said that he has not expressed support for any candidates. Iran’s presidential election is scheduled to be held on May 19. Six candidates are competing for the presidential post. However, some candidates may withdraw candidacy before the voting starts. Simultaneously, council elections will be held. NA/PA
