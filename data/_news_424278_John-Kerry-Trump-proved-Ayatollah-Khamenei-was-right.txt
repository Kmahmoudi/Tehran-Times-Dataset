TEHRAN – Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has sharply criticized the Trump administration’s Iran policy, saying Trump has confirmed everything that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei feared about [trusting] America. In an interview with Switzerland’s Neue Zurcher Zeitung newspaper, Kerry said, “Trump’s exit is surely the biggest strategic mistake since the Iraq war and one of the most significant mistakes in American history.” “The U.S. has chosen a strategy vis-a-vis Iran as it once pursued President Bush against Iraq, a strategy of ‘regime change’. As history shows, this does not come out well,” he warned. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
