TEHRAN – The president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (KRG) has said a prospective referendum for independence should not concern Iran or Turkey.

 Speaking to Saudi Arabian newspaper Akkath in an interview published on Sunday, Masoud Barzani said that 25 years of experience should have proven that the Iraqi Kurdistan would not pose any threat to Turkey or Iran. He also dismissed a question about Iran’s alleged intervention in Iraq, but stressed “Iran is more there in Iraq than any other country…. And we want our relations with Iran based on good neighborliness and common interests.” SP/PA
