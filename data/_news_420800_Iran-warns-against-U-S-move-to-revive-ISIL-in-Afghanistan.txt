TEHRAN – A senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker on Sunday warned of the dangers of Washington’s move to transfer Daesh (ISIL) militants to northern Afghanistan to revive the terrorist group in the future. Hossein Amir Abdollahian made the remarks in a meeting with Jan Kubis, chairman of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). He said despite UN’s constructive efforts, Washington is transferring Daesh’s leaders from Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan, IRIB news reported. By continuing to make use of Daesh in Afghanistan, the White House is making a “strategic mistake”, he added.
