TEHRAN – Tehran’s architectural treasure, the lavish Golestan Palace, will provide Iranian fashion designers with inspiration at the coming edition of Fajr International Fashion and Clothing Festival. For the first time, the festival plans to take up an impressive collection of clothes with the concept of a historic monument, Golestan Palace, in the competition section. The fashion and textile designers will submit their works revolving around the Golestan Palace during the festival, which runs from February 25 to March 4 in Tehran.  There is a common ground between the design elements involved in both architecture and fashion and many fashion designers around the world are inspired by architecture in their works.  Golestan Palace became a center of Qajari (1785 to 1925) arts and architecture of which it is an outstanding example and has remained a source of inspiration for Iranian artists and architects to this day. The lavish palace consists of 17 structures including nine separate museums and sites, or lounging in the shade next to a dancing water fountain. It embodies a successful integration of earlier Persian crafts and architecture with Western influences. Workshops, professional meetings  A total of 12 meetings and workshops will be held on fashion design and clothing one month before the inauguration of the festival. The meetings will be mainly on the theme of regional costumes and job creation in the field of clothing and jewelry designs. All fashion designers, clothing industry managers and those who are interested in the clothing and fashion industry can attend the events free of charge.
