TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that Iran’s four-point peace plan is still the only solution to the Yemen conflict.
 “Desperate attempt UNSC by US&UK to cover up complicity in 3 years of Saudi & Emirati war crimes in Yemen failed. Since the very start, Iran called for ceasefire, aid, dialogue & inclusive government. This—not a delusion of military victory or accusations—remains the only solution,” he tweeted on Tuesday. The Iranian foreign minister made the comment a day after Russia vetoed a resolution at the UN Security Council presented by Britain and strongly backed by the United States, which called for "additional measures" against Iran over allegations that it violated the 2015 arms embargo on the war-torn Arabian Peninsula state. In April 2015, Zarif submitted a letter to Ban Ki-moon, then UN secretary general, outlining its four-point peace plan for Yemen. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and end of all foreign military attacks, humanitarian assistance, a resumption of broad national dialogue and establishment of an inclusive national unity government. In a televised interview aired on February 5, Zarif urged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to stop war in Yemen and disintegration of the country. “These countries’ policies in the past three years have produced nothing but hatred and murder. We believe that there is no solution to the Yemen crisis except Iran’s four-point plan,” he explained.
