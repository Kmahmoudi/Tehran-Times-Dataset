TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that enemies are seeking to make the Iranian people disappointed about the future of their country.
 “A conspiracy of the enemies against the Iranian nation is causing disappointment about the future of the country,” he said during a speech at a ceremony held to mark Labour Week. “We should make Iran more prosperous through helping each other and setting hopes on the future,” he added. He said, “What is the use of being sad about the future? Why should we be sad that the next year is going to be more difficult? We should always be hopeful about the future.”  “There is a foul-mouthed man in the U.S. who always speaks ill of Iran and last year he said that the Islamic republic of Iran will not see the 40th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution, but today, we have entered the 40th anniversary of the revolution and we will celebrate the 41th anniversary of the victory of Islamic Revolution more gloriously than ever to disappoint enemies,” Rouhani stated. He noted that being hopeful about the future does not mean refraining to plan and make efforts for the future. Elsewhere, Rouhani said, “This year is year of supporting Iranian products and we should make more efforts in this respect.” “We should all join hands to produce high quality commodities to attract more customers,” he added.
