TEHRAN – Finally on Sunday President Hassan Rouhani officially released the names of four nominees to the parliament for the post of Labor, economy, industry, and transport ministers. 

 The names were released to the media after many speculations that who will fill these posts.   Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs Hossein-Ali Amiri said that Rouhani will attend the Majlis when the MPs start confirmation hearings on the nominees on October 28. “In a letter to the parliament, Rouhani proposed to appoint Farhad Dejpasand as the minister of economy; Mohammad Eslami as minister of transport and urban development; Mohammad Shariatmadari as minister of cooperatives, labor, and social welfare; and Reza Rahmani as minister of industry, mine and trade,” MP Assadollah Abbasi told reporters on the sidelines of an open session of parliament.  Labor Minister Ali Rabiee and Economy Minister Masoud Karbasian were voted out by parliament on August 8 and 26 respectively. However, Transport Minister Abbas Akhondi reportedly resigned in protest to differences with some key allies of President Rouhani. The unemployment rate and devaluation of national currency and price hikes were cited as the main reasons for impeaching the ministers of labor and economy.  Shariatmadari, who led the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Mine until Saturday, is being nominated for labor minister. Shariatmadari, also trade minister in the Khatami administration, is a graduate of electrical engineering from University of Kerman. Mohammad Eslami has studied civil engineering at University of Detroit Mercy. He has held various jobs including governor of Mazandaran province. Dejpasand is an economics professor at Beheshti University; he has also worked as deputy head of the Planning and Budget Organization among other jobs. Rahmani has a degree in DBA (doctor of business administration) and has served as deputy minister of industry, mine and trade. Abbas Akhoundi released his resignation letter on Saturday. The letter dated back to September 1. He cited disagreements on urban redevelopment as the main reason behind his decision. In the letter, Akhoundi criticized the Rouhani administration’s handling of U.S. sanctions for violating the essential rights of ownership and fair competition. He added that he had resigned on three previous occasions and asked Rouhani to accept his resignation this time. On Saturday as he attended the unveiling ceremony of smartification projects at Imam Khomeini Airport, Akhoundi said it was his last day as minister.
