TEHRAN – In a statement on Saturday, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tehran has officially warned the U.S. that it will bring a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) if Washington continues illegal actions against the Iranian diplomats. Saeed Khatibzadeh said Iran has issued an official memorandum in that regard and submitted it through the Tehran embassy of Switzerland, which represents U.S. interests in Iran. "In this memo, the American side has been warned that Iran will bring the U.S. to the International Court of Justice if Washington fails to stop its illegal actions against Iranian diplomats at international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) whose headquarters are located on U.S. soil," the spokesman said. Khatibzadeh added, "It has been a long time that the U.S. government has, in breach of international law, imposed many restrictions on Iranian diplomats and their families at international organizations in the Unties States, and these actions have disrupted and obstructed the performance of diplomats of Iran and several other countries." "Despite its commitments as a host of several international organizations, the U.S. has never been a good host," he said, adding, "The U.S. has, through the history of the UN, tried to harass and annoy the diplomats as wells families and children of the diplomats of countries with which it has bilateral differences."
