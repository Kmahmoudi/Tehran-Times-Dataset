TEHRAN – Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of the Iranian parliamentary committee for national security and foreign policy, says Iran’s support for the resistance axis is enshrined in the country’s Constitution. “Defending the oppressed of the world, particularly the Muslims, has been enshrined in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Boroujerdi said in an appearance with visiting member of Yemen’s Supreme Revolutionary Committee.  Article 152 of Iran’s Constitution envisions a foreign policy that is hostile to arrogant powers, embracing of all oppressed nations, and supportive of the world’s Muslims.  Iran backs resistance movements in the region, particularly those in Syria, Palestine, and Yemen in their cause against Zionism, Takfirism, and Wahhabism.  In Yemen, Tehran has thrown its weight behind the Yemeni resistance that has stood up to Saudi Arabia.  Riyadh invaded the small, poor Arab country in March 2015 to restore power to Hadi, who is living in exile in Saudi Arabia. Yemeni people are against Hadi.  “Iran will press ahead with its humanitarian aid to the oppressed Yemeni people, and the Iranian Majlis will support it, as well,” Boroujerdi concluded.  AK/MS
