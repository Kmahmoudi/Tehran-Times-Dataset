These news comes after Iranian President Sayed Ebrahim Raisi made a general warning on 18 April, saying that any Israeli aggression against the Islamic Republic will result in Iran striking into the heart of Israeli occupied lands and military bases. “Just know that if the slightest move on your part occurs against our nation, our armed forces will target the center of the Zionist regime, and the power of our armed forces will not leave you at rest,” Raisi said as Iran marked Army Day. During his speech, Raisi also said Iran’s military capabilities are internationally recognized. “Today, our military industry is in the best condition,” he said. After Raisi’s speech, a series of missiles, launch systems, and more than a dozen types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were displayed.
