“The policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is to support the government of Iraq,” Ayatollah Khamenei stated in a meeting with Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim, the leader of the United Iraqi Alliance bloc of the Iraqi parliament. The Leader described the relationship between the two nations of Iran and Iraq as very strong. “The foundations of these ties are the longstanding religious, cultural, and historical relations between the two nations of Iran and Iraq, and the long border of the two countries. And the Islamic Republic of Iran has always supported Iraq’s territorial integrity, security, and development.” He went on to say that the United States is making serious efforts to damage the deep-rooted relations between the two neighboring states. It is absolutely necessary that all the people of Iraq, comprising Shia, Sunni, Kurd, Turkmen, and Arab, be vigilant and maintain their unity more than ever, he noted. - Need for unity “If the Iraqi people and government strengthen their unity and increase their cooperation, then there will be no excuse for the presence of occupiers, and they should leave this country,” Ayatollah Khamenei said. Lamenting the slaughter of innocent Shia and Sunni citizens of Iraq, Ayatollah Khamenei said all groups must support the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the battle against terrorism. The continued presence of foreigners is “one of the main causes of insecurity” in Iraq, he added. Hakim presented a report about the latest developments in Iraq and thanked Iran for its support of the Iraqi nation and government. He said the massive participation of the Iraqi people in the Ashura mourning ceremonies was a sign of the Iraqi people’s vigilance, which is a great support for the government. Hakim, who is also the Leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), also noted that a plan is currently being implemented by the government to take over security responsibilities and create stability and thereby render various services and raise the standard of living.
