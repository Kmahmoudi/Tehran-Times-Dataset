Amir Abdollahian stressed that the adversaries sought to claim in diplomatic messages and meetings that they were not responsible for recent disturbances in the Islamic nation after being disappointed by a multidimensional hybrid warfare. The foreign minister noted that the U.S., Israeli regime, and their Western allies perpetrated whatever they wished against Iran. All plots and ploys of enemies failed due to the Leader’s wise stances, the Iranians’ insight, as well as the great public support for the Islamic establishment, he emphasized.
