TEHRAN â€“ Iran has exported $400 million worth of knowledge-based products during the past Iranian calendar year 1396 (March 2017-March 2018), the vice president for science and technology Sourena Sattari said on Monday, YJC reported. Export of knowledge-based products is very different from export of ordinary ones since knowledge-based products are required to meet special standards, he added. Iran has already activated the Tech Export Services Corridor (TESC) in 60 countries, he announced. TESC is an export support organization for Iranian high-tech and medium-tech companies. It facilitates the export process for Iranian manufacturers by providing services in the areas of marketing, consultancy, and international alliances. Iran achieves considerable growth in knowledge-based economy, Sattari added. Though there is a long way to reach the ideal point in the field of technology in the country, he explained. The knowledge-based companies increase innovation and efficiency with low price, he added. During the past Iranian calendar year 1396, Iranians conducted 1.3 quadrillion rials (about 31 billion dollars) internet interactions, he announced. The economic growth is not possible through traditional systems, which have no added value, he lamented. The educated people create job through establishment of startups, he said.
