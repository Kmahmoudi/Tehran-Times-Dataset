TEHRAN – With South Pars gas field’s new phases going operational, the required feedstock for all the country’s petrochemical plants will be supplied during the cold season and none of them will stop production, Shana reported quoting an official with the National Petrochemical Company (NPC). “In the past few years, during the cold season some petrochemical complexes would go offline due to a lack of feedstock [resulted from the increase in household gas consumption].” Ghodratollah Farajpour, the NPC’s director of production control, said. According to the official, Iran produced 27.5 million tons of petrochemical products during the first half of current Iranian calendar year (March 21-September 22). Farajpour noted that the figure shows two percent increase compared to the first half of the previous year. The NPC director noted that this rise has occurred despite overhaul operation in a number of high-capacity production units during the first half of this year which made some halts in production of these units. The value of petrochemical exports from the country during the first eight months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-November 21) rose 32 percent compared to the same period of time in the past year.
