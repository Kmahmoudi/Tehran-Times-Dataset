TEHRAN -- As evidence displays, the capital’s air pollution and traffic congestion are amongst the main concerns of the newly-elected Tehran City Council.  During the first session of the fifth Tehran City Council on Wednesday, the chairman Mohsen Hashemi highlighted the need for following-up on different urban management plans with the aim of reducing traffic congestion and decreasing air pollution in the capital as one of the main programs of the council.   Hashemi proposed the expansion of public transportation as the solution for environmental problems Tehrani citizens are grappling with. He also pointed to reducing general expenses and government involvement in urban management and improving cultural and social services as the aims of the new council. He is of the opinion that air pollution, massive traffic jam, noise pollution, urban environment damages, the sprawling city, run-down areas, labor children, etc. are all making Tehran ill-suited to inhabit. Hashemi, 56, is the eldest son of the late Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani - the fourth president of Iran. The pro-reform Hope list succeeded to win all the 21 council seats in Tehran on May 19 election, replacing priniciplist who took the helm of the fourth council. Najafi in, Qalibaf out
 
Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who served in the post of Tehran Mayor for 12 years, left his office on Tuesday for the new mayor.  Mohammad Ali Najafi, the sole candidate for the post of Tehran mayor, was formally elected at the first session of Tehran City Council on Wednesday. All Tehran city councilors voted for Najafi, a reformist figure who held office at the Education Ministry from 1988 to 1997. However, the mayor will be officially inaugurated after getting approval from the Ministry of Interior which is due to take place in coming days.  All in all, Tehrani citizens hope for a brighter future and a more vibrant city with the new council setting sights on a cleaner sky.
