TEHRAN – The Russian Foreign Ministry has described the U.S. claims against the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps as baseless, rejecting Washington’s move to list the IRGC as a terrorist organization. Its spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested that Iran can bring a case to the International Court of Justice for the illegal act, IRNA reported on Friday. Zakharova rejected Washington’s Iranophobia policy and described it as unacceptable. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization, sparking fierce reactions from Iranian officials and the people as well. In a reciprocal measure, Iran also added American forces in the Middle East to its list of terror groups.
