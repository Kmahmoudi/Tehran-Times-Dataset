TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that warmongers are more worried about Iran’s compliance to the 2015 nuclear deal than a violation of it.
 “Warmongers confess they’re more worried that we abide by JCPOA than violate it. No spin will mask this. U.S. should try to comply—just like us,” Zarif tweeted on Tuesday. On Friday U.S. President Donald Trump decertified Iran’s compliance to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name for the nuclear agreement, and used a harsh language against Iran. This is while the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed for eight times that Iran has fulfilled its commitments under the deal. According to the JCPOA, Iran agreed to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for the termination of economic and financial sanctions. The deal went into effect in January 2016. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini published an article on her website on Monday saying that the 2015 nuclear agreement is a deal that no country can “terminate” unilaterally. Also the European Union issued a statement on Monday after a foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg insisting the 27-nation bloc is committed to the “full and effective” implementation of the nuclear deal. The nuclear deal was signed during the Obama administration between Iran, the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia, Germany, and the European Union in July 2015 and went into effect in January 2016.
