TEHRAN- The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) announced that the inflation rate in the twelve-month period ended on October 22, which marks the end of the Iranian calendar month of Mehr, stood at 15.9 percent, IRIB reported on Sunday. The figure shows a 2.4-percent increase from 13.5 percent inflation rate announced by the CBI for the twelve-month period ended on September 22, which marks the end of the previous calendar month. As CBI reported, in the urban areas, the average goods and services Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 148.4 in Mehr, indicating 4.6 percent increase compared to the previous month. In Iranian calendar year 1395 (ended on March 20, 2017), Iran could manage to experience a single-digit inflation rate after 26 years. The inflations rate stood at 9.8 percent in that year according to the Statistical Center of Iran and at nine percent according to the CBI. But since this year’s calendar month of Khordad (ended on June 22), when the inflation rate stood at 10.2 percent, as announced by the CBI, the country’s experiencing a double-digit inflation rate again.
