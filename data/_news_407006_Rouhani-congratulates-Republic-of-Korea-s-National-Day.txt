TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has congratulated the Republic of Korea’s President Park Geun-hye on the anniversary of the country’s National Foundation Day.
 “I hope that we would witness expansion of relations in various areas given many capacities that were created during your visit [to Iran] in the current year,” he wrote in a message. October 3 is Korea’s National Foundation Day. The day is a public holiday in the Republic of Korea and celebrates the legendary formation of the first Korean state of Gojoseon in 2333 BC. Park visited Iran in May. The trip was first since the two nations established diplomatic ties in 1962. She was accompanied by the biggest-ever traveling business delegation of over 230 executives during the three-day visit. Iran and the Republic of Korea signed 19 memoranda of understanding and cooperation documents in order to expand ties during the visit. The documents were in maritime transportation, oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals, water resources, development of electrical energy and new energy industries, fishing and aquaculture, science and technology among others.
