TEHRAN - Restoration work on the UNESCO-inscribed Dolat Abad Garden in the central city of Yazd will be completed within a month. The renovation project commenced in early April, as part of efforts to renovate landscaping and to reinforce its octagonal pavilion which is surmounted by an imposing wind tower, said director of the World Heritage site Majid Oloumi, ISNA reported. The property together with eight others across the country have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list under the title of “The Persian Garden.” The concept of the Persian Garden interweaves natural elements with manmade components to embody an idea of creating a paradise on Earth by the means of artistic, philosophical, figurative, and religious notions.
