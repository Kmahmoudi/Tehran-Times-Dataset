TEHRAN - Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan insisted on Tuesday that Tehran’s military strategy is built upon an “effective preemptive power” with a reliance on public support.
 “National power and effective preemptive power should be maintained and military threats should be countered with power,” he said during a speech at a national ceremony on knowledge-based defense. “We should create a defense system with reliance on knowledge-based defense… and rapid move towards innovation and promotion of quality which would bring power to us,” he stated. Elsewhere in his remarks, he said, “The whole world admits that Daesh and (other) Takfiri-terrorist groups are the most serious threats against international security and Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the former U.S. government was [in fact] the founder of these Takfiri terrorists.”  Now it is the world which should make “judgment” whether Iran, which itself is a victim of terrorism, is fighting terrorism or the United States which accuses Iran of creating instability, Dehqan noted. He also said that the Zionist regime of Israel is making “desperate” efforts to create a coalition against Iran. Despite such commotion Iran will not abandon support for the oppressed Palestinians. “The world will never forget brutal and inhuman crimes of the regime against the Palestinians during the past 60 years and considers the regime as the main instigator of war, insecurity and crime in the region,” he said. Dehqan also urged the U.S. government to stop adopting policies which has undermined international security.
