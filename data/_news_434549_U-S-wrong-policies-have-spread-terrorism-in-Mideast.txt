TEHRAN - Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh said on Wednesday that the U.S. “wrong” and “illogical” decisions have led to spread of terrorism and violence in the Middle East region and beyond.
 He made the remarks during a meeting with Russian State Duma International Affairs Committee Chairman Slutsky in Moscow. Falahatpisheh criticized U.S. President Donald Trump’s “wrong policies” in supporting and training terrorists in the region. He suggested “interaction and cooperation among independent countries to counter the U.S. hegemony and illegal behaviors.”  The senior MP described Tehran-Moscow cooperation in countering terrorism in Syria as a good model to advance policies. Elsewhere, he attached great importance to removing impediments to expansion of economic relations.
