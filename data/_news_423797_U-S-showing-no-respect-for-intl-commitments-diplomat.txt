TEHRAN - Iraj Masjedi, the Iranian ambassador to Baghdad, said on Sunday that the U.S. has no respect for international law and commitments.
 During an Iftar party with a number of Iraqi officials and political and scientific figures, he said that the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and relocation its embassy to al-Quds proved that Washington ignores international law and obligations. President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the international nuclear deal on May 8. He also relocated the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds (Jerusalem) on May 14.
