TEHRAN – Rasoul Sanaee Raad, the IRGC deputy chief for political affairs, says the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) were responsible for the recent riots in a number of Iranian cities. Sanaee Raad said a number of MKO members were arrested in Kermanshah and Shiraz as they were provoking people to chant anti-government slogans and take part in riots, Fars reported. He also said that the U.S. plots and the money spent by the Saudi regime were behind the recent riots in Iran. MH/PA
