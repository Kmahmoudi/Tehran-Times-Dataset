TEHRAN – Presidential candidate Mostafa Hashemi Taba has complained that Iranian universities are in a scientifically bad situation.
 “This is specially so because there is a good market for doctoral theses that you could buy in the street,” he told the IRIB on Wednesday. He also complained that the scientific assessment system does not differentiate between students with good marks and bad marks and ruins the job market. A day earlier Hashemi Taba had said he would discard the cash handouts.
