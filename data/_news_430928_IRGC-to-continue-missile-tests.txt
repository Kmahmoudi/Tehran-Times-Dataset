TEHRAN - Islamic Revolution Guards Corps says it will continue its missile tests and research activities more actively than ever despite U.S. pressure. In an interview with IRNA published on Friday, Ali Fadavi, the IRGC deputy chief for coordination affairs, said conducting research on military equipment and missiles is a permanent job of the IRGC. Pointing to U.S. sanctions against Tehran, he said, “The harsher the sanctions get, the more defensive capabilities Iran will achieve.” “The sanctions have always been opportunities for us because they create the conditions for self-sufficiency,” Fadavi added.
