TEHRAN – The UN’s nuclear body, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has reported that the safeguards expenditures from its extra-budgetary contributions were €29.8 million in 2016, 10.9 percent more compared to 2015.

 “This increase resulted mainly from the implementation of Iran’s Additional Protocol, verifying and monitoring Iran’s nuclear-related commitments as set out in the JCPOA and the Agency’s MOSAIC project,” the IAEA reported on Friday. Regular Budget appropriation for 2016 was adjusted to €133.1 million. SP/PA
