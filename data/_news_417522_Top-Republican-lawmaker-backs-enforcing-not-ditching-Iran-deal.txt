TEHRAN – The Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committee said on Wednesday the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, should be strictly enforced, but did not call for an end to the agreement, saying Washington should work with allies. “As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it,” Representative Ed Royce said at a hearing on Iran, Reuters reported.
