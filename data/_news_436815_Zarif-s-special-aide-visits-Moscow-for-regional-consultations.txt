Both sides were supposed to review important regional developments, especially those related to Syria and Yemen.   Recently, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow backs Iran’s proposal for a non-aggression pact with Persian Gulf Arab states. During his visit to Iraq on May 25-26, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a proposal to leaders of the Persian Gulf states to sign the pact as a prelude to de-escalation of conflicts in the Persian Gulf region. Lavrov said that the initiative was discussed with the [Persian] Gulf Cooperation Council. The Israeli regime and the United States have been trying hard to demonize Iran in the eyes of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
