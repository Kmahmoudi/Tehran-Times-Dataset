TEHRAN – In a ceremony on Monday, Iran unveiled the mass production of a medium-range air-to-air missile, dubbed Fakour. Addressing the ceremony, Defense Minister Amir Hatami said Fakour is a radar-equipped mid-range missile designed and produced by using state-of-the-art technology. It could be engaged against various aggressive aircraft within its operational range, the minister stated. He called the missile’s mass production an important step in line with boosting the country’s defensive power and promoting the country’s deterrence capability. The missile, the minister said, has reached the mass-production stage despite U.S.-led sanctions targeting Iran’s missile industry. “Today, we live in an environment, where we are surrounded by shameless enemies and mischievous people like the current rulers of the United States, and some of its allies, who do not understand anything other than the language of force,” the defense chief remarked. He added that in line with the instructions of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would give a proportionate response to any threat. Iranian military experts and technicians have in recent years made great headways in manufacturing a broad range of indigenous equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient in the arms sphere. Tehran has always assured other nations that its military might poses no threat to regional countries and others, saying that the Islamic Republic’s defense doctrine is entirely based on deterrence.
