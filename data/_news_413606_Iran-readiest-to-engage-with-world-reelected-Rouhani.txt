TEHRAN – In a live televised address just hours after reelection, President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran is “readier than ever before” to interact with the world. 
 “Prouder than ever before, Iran is today ready to step up its relations with the world on the basis of mutual respect and national interests,” Rouhani said on Saturday. “Our nation’s message (of peace and friendship) was explicitly departed to the world … and the nation expects this most important message to be correctly heard by all governments, neighbors, and specifically, by great powers.”  Rouhani who won a landslide vote on Friday was making the comments as hostile President Trump was visiting Saudi Arabia, which is at loggerheads with Tehran over a list of issues.  “Our elections indicated to the neighbors and the region that the way to restore security to the region is to shore up democracy and honor the people’s votes rather than to rely on foreign powers,” Rouhani added.   Into last months of his first term, Rouhani has a tough time ahead to mend strained relations with the Arab world and Turkey.   During his presidential campaigns, he also pledged to remove non-nuclear sanctions against Tehran, interpreted by some as an indirect signal to the Trump administration not to rule out a better prospect between the two countries, which have no political ties for nearly four decades.  “I commit myself to the announced plans,” the 68 cleric, who championed the nuclear deal with world powers, emphasized in his address.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
