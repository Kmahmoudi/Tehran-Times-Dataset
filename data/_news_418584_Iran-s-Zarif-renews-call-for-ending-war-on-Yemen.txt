 “My message to the United Nations’ secretary general about dismal situation in Yemen and urgent necessity to study my four-item plan and reach a political solution to the human suffering,” he tweeted in Arabic on Sunday. He attached his letter to Guterres in his twitter message. The letter was also written in Arabic.
