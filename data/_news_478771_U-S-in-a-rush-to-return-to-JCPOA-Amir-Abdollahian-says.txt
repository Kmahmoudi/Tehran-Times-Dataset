TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has reacted to remarks by American officials that talks over reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is not a priority for them. The Iranian foreign minister said Iran has been constantly exchanging messages with the American side and the latest message was sent to the U.S. in the last 72 hours. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a cabinet session on Wednesday, Amir Abdollahian said, “We will strongly continue our work in order to overcome sanctions.  We didn’t negotiate for negotiations. We negotiated for the sake of an outcome.” He added, “We exchange messages with the American side constantly. Our last message was [sent] less than 72 hours ago. The Americans are sending messages that they are in a rush for the JCPOA. But they give interviews and say that [the JCPOA] is not their priority.” The remarks came after several Biden officials claimed that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is no longer on their agenda, at least for now. Rob Malley, the U.S. envoy for Iran, mixed the unrest with the talks over resurrecting the JCPOA. Malley said the U.S. is no longer pushing for the resuscitation of the JCOPA due to “protests” in Iran and its alleged provision of drones to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Speaking to reporters in Paris, the U.S. special envoy said for now Washington would continue a policy of sanctions and pressure. On Monday, Amir Abdollahian spoke over the phone with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell to discuss the JCPOA talks. “The two sides discussed sanctions removal talks as well as cooperation between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement. Despite sanctions and pressures from the West, Iran is still committed to reaching a fair deal on the JCPOA. But the West’s continued procrastination, which is based on new miscalculations, could push Iran into relinquishing diplomacy regarding the JCPOA talks. In his Wednesday remarks, Amir Abdollahian also pointed to efforts by the U.S. and its European allies in tabling a censure resolution against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors. Commenting on the resolution, Amir Abdollahian said, “We sent the necessary messages to the European sides. We spoke to some of the European foreign ministers, including Mr. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief.” The Iranian foreign minister added that he told the European officials that if they don’t stop “this unconstructive path,” they will face Iran’s reciprocal and effective response.  The United States, Britain, France and Germany want the UN nuclear watchdog's board to pass a resolution calling it "essential and urgent" for Iran to explain uranium traces found at three undeclared sites, according to a Reuters report. "(The Board of Governors) decides it is essential and urgent ... that Iran act to fulfil its legal obligations and ... take the following actions without delay," said the text, dated Friday and listing actions such as providing credible explanations for the traces. Other actions listed included "provide all information, documentation, and answers the Agency requires" and "provide access to locations and material the Agency requires, as well as for the taking of samples as deemed appropriate by the Agency". The draft text, which would need to be passed by a simple majority of board members, also said the board "expresses profound concern that the safeguards issues related to three undeclared locations remain outstanding due to insufficient substantive cooperation by Iran".
