TEHRAN â€” Iranians have so far donated some 1.3 trillion rials (nearly $31 million) in both cash and kind to the flood victims, Iranian Red Crescent Society Chief Ali Asghar Peyvandi said on Saturday.
 Floods hitting Iran since March 19 have been highly devastating especially in provinces of Golestan, Mazandaran, Lorestan and Khuzestan, Peyvandi said, Fars news agency reported. He went on to say that the only region not struck with flood was Kish Island and all other 31 provinces were hit by flood to some extent. More than 227,000 were provided with emergency accommodation, he added, noting that thankfully the causalities remained low. No financial aids have been received so far due to the sections, he regretted, adding that some countries like Germany, Kuwait, Armenia, Pakistan, Turkey, etc. have sent in-kid contributions to Iran. Islamic Republic of Iran Army, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and Basij have collectively attempted to provide services to the flood victims, he concluded. Heavy rainfall, beginning on March 19 has led to flooding in 28 out of 31 provinces affecting 42,269,129 inhabitants in 253 cities and causing widespread damage to municipal facilities, including health centers and hospitals. Many health facilities in affected areas are either fully or partially damaged, and the risk of water- and vector-borne diseases, including malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases is increasing, also due to the interruption of the water supply. Following devastating flood hitting Iranian provinces some 1,660,100 individuals are in need of health care services in areas where the floods have left 78 people dead and 1,137 injured. As many as 295,787 people have been displaced. MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
