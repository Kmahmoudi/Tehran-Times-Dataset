TEHRAN – U.S. Treasury Department has issued a new batch of sanctions against four entities that it says have ties to the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and airlines that are already on Washington’s black list, Russia Today reported. The new sanctions list published by the Treasury on Thursday contains only one Iranian entity – a cargo airline based in the southern town of Qeshm – Qeshm Fars Air.  The company was subjected to U.S. punitive measures over its ties to another Iranian airline, Mahan Air, which was already sanctioned by the U.S.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
