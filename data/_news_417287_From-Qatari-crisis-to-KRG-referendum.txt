An earlier referendum on the Kurdish region would have alleviated the need for Americans and Zionists to form a crisis between Qatar and Persian Gulf littoral states. Roots of the Qatari crisis must be traced in the years 2010-2016 when the common point among all south Persian Gulf littoral states was to confront the Arab Spring.
Back then, the Ikhwan Islamic militia was directly backed by Qataris who later began to support Al-Nusra terrorist group. Opposition groups in Syria lack agreement given that they receive political and ideological supply from various sources. The Zionist regime and the US failed to achieve their goals in Syria since effective action by Iran and Hezbollah prevented further movement of terrorists. A number of Persian Gulf states held the joint target of confronting Islamic Awakening with the intellectual support of Mossad, the CIA and MI6. Consequently, regional crises were ignited with the aim of preventing dominoes of Islamic awakening and benchmarking the Islamic Revolution. Americans and the Zionists soon realized that their plans to deal with Islamic Awakening were far-fetched thanks to the successful operations carried out against terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria. The issue of referendum on the Iraqi Kurdistan was an alternative proposition once these countries had failed to reach their goals in fostering regional crisis.
Following the change in America’s policies in the Middle East since Donald Trump had taken office, Saudis, affected by threatening talks by Trump during his presidential campaign, decided to enter a deal with the US. The image changed completely during Trump’s first visit to Saudi Arabia as old differences between Arab states and Qatar would be refreshed once again. The Persian Gulf Cooperation Council (PGCC) would always magnify anti-Iranian stances. As a result, internal differences would always remain hidden in PGCC statements in order to highlight the anti-Iranian showcase though the Riyadh meeting changed the game. Meanwhile, ethnic intolerance and tribal differences between Arabs in the Persian Gulf remain as other sources of dispute among these countries. Once the public opinion concluded that ISIL was a terrorist group and had to be eliminated, Persian Gulf states felt time was ripe to find a guilty state and accused Qatar of all they had done over the years in supporting terrorists. In the meanwhile, England began an ingenious game inside the region. Indeed, England has always sought to strike a balance between regional currents would never allow a group to overcome the other. A view of reactions of various countries after the crisis in Qatar shows that Turkey stood on the side of Qatar after the crisis and supported the country by breaking economic sanctions. In is noteworthy that Iran also conducted an effective behavior in the face of Qatari crisis by preventing Americans from implementing their evil plot against Qatar. The conditions set for Qatar by Arab countries merely meant to eliminate Qatar’s power structures and they included breaking ties with Iran and Hezbollah, shutting down the Al Jazeera network and removing Turkish troops. To recapitulate, Americans and the Zionists have hatched various plots to foster crisis and dispute inside the region. As such, an earlier referendum on the Kurdish region would have alleviated the need for the global arrogance to form an adversity between Qatar and south Persian Gulf littoral states. The bottom line is, in case of separation of Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) from Iraq, the region will turn into backyard of the Zionist regime.
