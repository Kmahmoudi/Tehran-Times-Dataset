TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that protecting Iraq’s territorial integrity and boosting national unity are main priorities.
 Rouhani made the remarks during a meeting with Ammar Hakim, chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI), and his accompanying team. Rouhani said, “Unfortunately, actions and words of the major powers show that they are seeking to create division among the Iraqi people.”  The president also said Iran will spare no effort in supporting the Iraqi and Syrian people in fight against terrorism and extremism, highlighting the necessity of expanding Tehran-Baghdad ties. For his part, Hakim said Iraq seeks to have “exemplary” relations with Iran. Also, Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani met separately with Hakim on Tuesday. Larijani said Iran welcomes expansion of relations with the regional countries including Iraq. He also said the growing sectarian rift among Muslims is the most "serious threat" to the region. Hakim said Iraq views the liberation of Mosul as an example of national unity. ‘Palestine issue should be first priority’  In a separate meeting on Tuesday with Ramadan Shalah, the leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Rouhani said the Palestinian issue should be the first priority. He said the Zionist regime of Israel has never been after peace and therefore no way is left other than resistance by Palestinians against the occupying regime. Shalah also praised Iran’s supports for the Palestinians.  He also expressed regret over the fact that some regional countries seek to marginalize the Palestine issue by creating conflicts in the region.
