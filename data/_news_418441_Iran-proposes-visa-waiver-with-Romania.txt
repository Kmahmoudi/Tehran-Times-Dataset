TEHRAN – Majlis (parliament) speaker advisor for international affairs called for removing visa requirements between Iran and Romania and facilitating banking cooperation between the two countries. “Removing visa requirements and facilitating banking cooperation are effective in accelerating boosting economic and trade cooperation level,” Hossein Amirabdollahian said Sunday in a meeting with Chairman of Iran-Romania Parliamentary Friendship Group Virgil-Daniel Popescu.  “Iran and Romania Parliaments play major roles and promoting parliamentary ties will help facilitate cooperation in state and private sectors,” he said. “Iran’s Majlis is ready to boost cooperation with Parliament of Romania in all fields including parliamentary friendship groups and expert commissions,” he said. “Although terrorism has been weakened in the region, but it still exists and it threatens regional countries and the world community as well,” Amirabdollahian said, referring to developments in the region. “Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the only solution to regional crises is negotiations,” he noted. “Those who created Daesh terrorists in the region are now after reinforcing terrorist groups and continuing tension and conflict,” the Iranian official reiterated. Meanwhile, Popescu welcomed holding negotiations between Iran and Romania chambers of commerce and private sectors. He referred to visa waiver for the two countries, saying fruitful talks are under way in Romania to solve this problem for the Iranian businessmen and students. “As a European Union member state, Romania hails finding peaceful solutions to regional crises,” he added.
