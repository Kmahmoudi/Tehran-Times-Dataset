Aiming to discover feasible approaches to environmental protection, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the Department of the Environment of Iran are holding the International Seminar on the Environment, Religion and Culture, which was inaugurated here on Monday. The 3-day seminar aims to pave the way for dialogue among religions and cultures on the environment, and the study of different religions' views on protection of the environment. Professor S. Waqar Ahmed Husaini, the president of the Institute of Islamic Science, Technology and Development (IISTD), talking to the TEHRAN TIMES, said, "We have hundreds of verses about the earth. The Qoran says, Allah created earth and heaven, don't engage in corruption on earth." He added that water, air and soil are the main elements of the environment. Talking on the relation of religions and the environment, Husaini explained that religions, specifically Islam, have special rules for preserving the environment. "So man, following these rules, can take an important step to protect the environment", he added. On the role of such seminars in protection of the environment, the Managing Director of the Green Front of Iran, Siamak Moattari, told the TEHRAN TIMES, "Our problem is that seminars are closed and afterward nothing is followed. Intellectuals should introduce people to green thought." "Since our society is religious, we can find the main points," he added. "We have the argument of justice. The just use of natural resources can help humanity. Islam is the protector of the environment and whatever destroys the environment is considered to be prohibited," Moattari added. The Head of the Cultural Committee of the Jewish Association, Soleiman Hakakian, told the TEHRAN TIMES that it is written in the Torah that God created the earth as an ideal home for humans and asked them to preserve the earth. This shows the holiness of the environment. "God has not created the world for destruction but for flourishing. Humans are created from earth, prostrate on the earth and go to heaven from the earth," he continued. The seminar was opened by President Mohammad Khatami yesterday where, he stressed that scientific debates can lead to joint global drives for protection of the environment. President Khatami said that reliance on religious commonalties in the environment and nature will promote lifestyle at the global level. He said that ongoing crisis in the world has been caused by failure to have a comprehensive view on existence as well as by turning a blind eye to natural phenomenon and spirituality. President Khatami said that domination of the superficial and one-sided approach on politics, economy and planning have brought about negligence of the depth of the world and poor understanding of nature as well as denial of global principles and regulations. He said that imbalance in environment will be detrimental to man and will provoke calamities on the present and future generations. During the seminar, the Vice President and Head of the Department of Environment (DOE), Ma'soumeh Ebtekar, said, "Protection of environment is the prime concern of human societies." Environmental problems have caused serious crises for man and the environment is in the spotlight of all development-related discussions, she said. Solving the issues of environment depends on a common determination and full-scale measures to be taken by officials of all countries as well as international and domestic groups, added the DOE head. Deputy of the UN Secretary General and the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Klaus Topfer congratulated President Mohammad Khatami on his victory during June 8 presidential elections. He said that the seminar is particularly timely, as this year has been declared the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations. The UN secretary general welcomed the dialogue initiated by President Mohammad Khatami and concurred that such a dialogue must respect diversity. Diversity is not only the basis for dialogue among civilizations but also the reality that makes dialogues necessary, he added. "It is through such encounters between the scientific and faith communities that, we hope, will emerge a greater understanding of the complexity of the challenges faced by us and a renewed commitment to taking responsible actions for our common good." Terming the world summit for sustainable development, scheduled to be held in Johannesburg in September 2002, as an important milestone, he expressed hope that Tehran declaration or recommendations will be a contribution to the Johannesburg summit, from the religious perspective. The present seminar will reveal the effective role of the divine religions on the environment protection after passing 20 years of holding the first seminar in Rio.
