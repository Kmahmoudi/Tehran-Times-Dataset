TEHRAN – Tehran has responded to the meddlesome comments by U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook, saying ties between Iran and Iraq is based on good neighborliness and strategic relations and do not concern others. Hook said on Monday that President Rouhani’s trip to Iraq is not in the interest of the Iraqi people, adding that the U.S. will sanction “sanctionable activities” anywhere in the world. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Tuesday that Hook’s anger is not surprising because despite spending billions of dollars in the Middle East, the U.S. has not been able to secure a favorable position among the regional nations, Mehr reported.
