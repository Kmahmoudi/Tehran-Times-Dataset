During the visit, Defense Minister Mostafa-Mohammad Najjar briefed Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces Ayatollah Khamenei on the country’s defense capabilities and Defense Ministry research projects in aerospace and missile technology, maritime and air defense, electronic warfare, and other fields. In addition, Najjar informed the Leader about the Defense Ministry’s construction projects and its success in scientific festivals. The Commander in Chief also paid tribute to the martyrs of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. Ayatollah Khamenei said that the level of development of the defense industries is good, but progress is unsatisfactory and just barely compensates for the long years of the country’s backwardness. Thus, Iranians must now make more efforts for national development than ever before, he added. Research is the backbone of scientific progress, and the academic, industrial, and defense sectors should acknowledge this and utilize the talents of gifted young people, the Leader stated. At the end of the visit, the exhibition participants attended noon and afternoon congregational prayers, led by Ayatollah Khamenei.
