TEHRAN – Presidential Chief of Staff Mohammad Nahavandian on Friday met members of the International Council of Swedish Industry (NIR) to exchange views on promoting economic ties. In the meeting, Nahavandian described Iran’s economy as an opportunity for the members of the Swedish council, ISNA reported. Compared to the past, he said, business owners and investors from all over the world can now collaborate with Iran much more easily. The Iranian official called on Swedish companies to get more engaged with Iran’s private sector, stressing that the country’s private sector is increasingly involved in the economy.  “In preparations to expand Iran’s economy, we have set aside the biggest part of the economy for the private sector,” he said, adding that because of the country’s economic stability, Swedish companies can form closer collaborations with Iran’s private sector. During the meeting, the members of the NIR raised questions about the terms and requirements of such collaborations with Iran and discussed investment opportunities in Iran’s various industries. Nahavandian arrived on Thursday evening in Stockholm to confer with the country's top economic officials on expansion of bilateral trade. Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by Iran's Ambassador to Stockholm Rasoul Mohajer, a number of Iranian businessmen and head of International Council of Swedish Industry (NIR). The NIR is the biggest economic organization of the country, consisting of firms and financial administrations which carry out half of Sweden's exports.
