Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on Tuesday claimed that Iran is following an “extremist ideology” and seeking to take over the Muslim world.
 He also claimed that Iran is seeking to take over Islamic holy sites in Saudi Arabia. He indirectly threatened Iran, saying, “We won’t wait for the battle to be in Saudi Arabia. Instead, we’ll work so that the battle is for them in Iran.” The inconsiderate, dangerous words show that the crown prince is either too naïve or adventurous. We hope the remarks were made when the prince was out of his mind.  One is perplexed how to analyze such outrageous remarks.  International bodies such as the UN Security Council must hold Saudi Arabia responsible for the statement that “…we’ll work so that the battle is for them in Iran”. Is Iran really seeking to take over the control of the holy sites in Saudi Arabia? Based on what facts is he making such delusional and unsubstantiated comments? Saudi Arabia is being caught in the Yemen quagmire and these remarks won’t heal its wounds. Contrary to the prince’s claims on an ideological Iran, the officials in Tehran have been pursuing a pragmatic approach both at home and abroad. Before the nuclear deal, certain countries were also claiming that Iran was building nuclear arms. Finally Iran proved that such accusations were wrong by concluding an international agreement over its nuclear program with six world powers. Iran is working hard to bring economic prosperity to its 80-million population through interaction with the outside world, including Saudi Arabia as a Middle East country. This goal happens only in a calm and secure environment. Also the Saudi official, before accusing Iran of promoting an “extremis ideology”, is better to see which country is the hotbed of Wahhabism which germinates extremism and terrorism. Were it Iranians who made most aggressive death-dealing terrorist attacks in human history in the United States on September 11, 2001, or 15 Saudi nationals out of 19 hijackers? He is better to bear in mind that the Saudi kingdom is globally infamous for inspiring extremism and terrible human rights conditions. In the 21st century, women are not allowed to drive cars in the kingdom and even can’t travel without a relative male, just to name a few.  So, it’s Saudi Arabia, not Iran, who is promoting an ideology of radicalism and extremism. It is Saudi Arabia which has destabilized the region extending from recognizing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to funding mosques and religious schools (madrassas) across the world.
