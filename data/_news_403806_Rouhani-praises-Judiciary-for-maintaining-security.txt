 “Security will not be maintained in any country unless the people are under the shelter of an impartial and efficient judiciary,” Rouhani told a gathering held to commemorate the Judiciary week. He also called on the judicial and executive bodies to expand cooperation in line with boosting the economy. The president said the Iranian and foreign investors do economic activities in the country by trusting the Judiciary, he said. The more the people trust in the judicial system, the more security will be established in the society, he stated. The president also said the people are waiting to see how the judiciary will deal with those who illegally “ordered” and “carried out” attacks on the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Elsewhere, he said that the government has sought to improve the economic situation by holding nuclear negotiations which its result was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, adding that support of the judicial and the executive bodies are required to help his administration to flourish the economy. Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany - finalized the text of the JCPOA in Vienna in July 2015. The nuclear agreement went into effect in January 2016.
