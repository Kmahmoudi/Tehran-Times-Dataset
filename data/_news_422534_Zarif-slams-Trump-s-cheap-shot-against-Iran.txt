TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s “cheap shot” against Iran with regard to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, saying Iran itself has been victim to Saddam Hussein’s chemical attacks in the 1980s. “Trump's cheap shot against Iran, which has consistently condemned use of chemical weapons by anyone & is itself the victim of their use by Saddam with U.S. support, is hypocritical. His threats to repeat impulsive acts of aggression is symptomatic of U.S. policy helping extremists,” Zarif tweeted on Tuesday.
