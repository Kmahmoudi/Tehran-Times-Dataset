TEHRAN – The 25th edition of Iran International Exhibition of Electronics, Computer & E-commerce (ELECOMP 2019) will be held from July 18 to 21. The Elecomp will be held with the motto of ‘better future’ this year, the head of Iranian Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Guild Organization Mohammad Baqer Asna-Ashari said on Wednesday, Mehr reported. ELECOMP Jobs is a new section, which will be added to the exhibition in order to boost entrepreneurship for ICT graduates, he said. Unfortunately, there is no connection between alumni and the companies, which may be facilitated by the ELECOMP Jobs section, he said. He named ELECOMP Trends as another important section in which, hi-techs like big data and blockchain are discussed. A total of six halls are allocated to startups, while the halls for startups are limited to four in past editions, he said. The ICT Ministry is negotiating with some foreign countries to take part in the ELECOMP 2019, he announced. ELECOMP is the biggest event in the Iranian electronics and computer market. Since its first edition in 1995, the event has been providing a unique opportunity for businesses to increase their share of this huge and ever-growing market.
