TEHRAN — The education and research committee of Majlis [the Iranian parliament] is following up on an allegedly sexually scandal at a school in Tehran, MP Davoud Mohammadi has said.  On May 27, some parents filed a complaint against a schoolmaster who has allegedly displayed some sexually harassing behaviors at a private school in district two of Tehran. The schoolmaster was soon detained and the school was shut down, maybe for good. The education minister, Mohammad Bat’haei, will attend the parliament and report on the latest developments on the issue to the education and research group of the Majlis, Tasnim news agency quoted Mohammadi as saying on Saturday.  He further highlighted that the sexual misconduct is a warning for private schools to take a heed in recruiting new teachers.  All teachers should be mentally healthy as they are in direct contact with the students, he concluded.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
