Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said on Friday that Japan supports the 2015 nuclear deal and confirms no violations by Tehran.
 “Japan supports the Iran agreement with the nuclear deals… So far we have not confirmed any violation by Iran,” Sputnik quoted Kono as saying during a press conference at the UN. Kono also said that Tokyo and Tehran share a “very good relationship”. The nuclear deal was signed between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia - in July 2015. The agreement went into effect in January 2016. Under the nuclear deal, Iran is obliged to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions against Tehran. Since the implementation of the nuclear deal the United Nations nuclear watchdog has issued nine regular reports each time confirming that Iran is abiding by the terms of the agreement. However, U.S. President Donald Trump, in a statement issued on October 13, refused to certify Iran’s compliance to the nuclear deal and asked Congress to decide about the fate of the nuclear deal. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a possible breakdown of the nuclear deal would send the wrong signal when it came to trying to resolve the situation around North Korea, Reuters reported. At a speech at the European Parliament plenary session on December 21, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said preserving and implementing the nuclear agreement is “an absolute must”. “We cannot afford to undermine the credibility of a multilateral agreement, endorsed by the UN Security Council Resolution, and we cannot afford to dismantle a deal that works and delivers on its promises,” she stated.
