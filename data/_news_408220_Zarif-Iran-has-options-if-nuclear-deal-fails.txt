Iran wants all parties to stick to an international nuclear deal but has options if that does not happen, its foreign minister said on Thursday after the U.S. election victory of Donald Trump, who has vowed to pull out of the pact. "Of course Iran's options are not limited but our hope and our desire and our preference is for the full implementation of the nuclear agreement, which is not bilateral for one side to be able to scrap," Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said. The accord removed sanctions in return for Iran reducing the number of its uranium-enrichment centrifuges by two-thirds, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile. "Our strong preference as a party that has remained fully committed and implemented its side of the bargain (...) is for every member and participant and for international community to continue to remain committed to the agreement," Zarif told a news conference in Bratislava after meeting his Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajcak.
"But it doesn't mean we don't have other options if the USA unwisely decides to move away from its obligations under the agreement," he said when asked whether Tehran would accelerate its enrichment if the Trump administration ditched the deal.
When asked whether he hoped for a similarly good working relationship with Trump's future secretary of state as he had with the outgoing John Kerry, Zarif said it would not be necessary.
"We had a long nuclear negotiation between Iran and the United States. I do not expect another negotiation, certainly not on the nuclear issue, but nor on any other subjects so that I would need to establish a same type of contact with the new secretary of state, whoever that may be," he said. Former U.S. House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich - who has said he would renegotiate the nuclear deal with Iran, has been floated as a potential secretary of state under Trump, political sources said.
