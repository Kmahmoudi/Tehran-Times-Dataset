TEHRAN - Head of Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran (FFIRI) Mehdi Taj said Team Melli’s kit for the 2018 FIFA World Cup will be unveiled in the friendly match against Uzbekistan.  Iran national football team will meet Uzbekistan in a warm-up match as part of preparation for the 2018 World Cup. The match is scheduled to be played on May 19 in Tehran’s Azadi Stadium. “Team Melli 2018 World Cup jerseys have not been revealed yet to avoid counterfeits. The Iran national team kit will be unveiled in the match against Uzbekistan,” Taj said. With less than two months left until the start of the 2018 World Cup, the Iranian federation and kit supplier Adidas have not unveiled Team Melli’s kit and the federation has received criticism from fans about the delay when other nations are being supplied. Endangered Asiatic Cheetah was imprinted on Team Melli's jersey during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, but it seems the image will not be stamped on Iran’s kit in the 2018 World Cup. Carlos Queiroz’s team have been drawn in Group B of the 2018 World Cup along with Spain, Morocco and Portugal. The Iran national football team will open the campaign with a match against Morocco at Saint Petersburg on June 15.
