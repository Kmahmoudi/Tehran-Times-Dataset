TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his German counterpart Heiko Maas in a phone conversation on Friday highlighted the necessity to settle the Syrian conflict politically.
 The talks took place one day before the U.S., Britain and France launched attacks on Syria on Saturday morning. The attack was conducted for an alleged use of chemical weapons in Douma, a city near Damascus, last week. Zarif condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria and said that it is essential for international bodies to investigate the issue in a neutral manner. Zarif said using the issue of chemical attack as an excuse to take military action against Syria will cause dangers to regional peace and security. Iran’s chief diplomat also said the United States’ sale of various kinds of weapons to certain regional countries, its support for the terrorists and its actions against the Yemenis are “sources of instability and insecurity”. In his talks with the German foreign minister, Zarif also said that all signatories to the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, must remain committed to their obligations. He said Europe should force the U.S. to remain committed to its obligations under the deal. The deal was signed between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council including the United States. It went into effect in January 2016. Based on the agreement Iran agreed to put limits on its nuclear work in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions. In a statement on January 12, U.S. President Donald Trump gave Europeans only 120 days to agree to an overhaul of the nuclear agreement. He threatened if the text of the nuclear deal is not revised he would unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from it. The deadline falls on May 12.  NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
