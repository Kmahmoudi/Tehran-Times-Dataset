TEHRAN- Iran’s Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian and Qatar’s Minister of Commerce and Industry Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari agreed on cooperation in energy and investment spheres between the two countries during a video conference. As the next meeting of Iran-Qatar Joint Economic Committee, which was scheduled to be held in Iran’s Isfahan City in the current Iranian calendar month of Farvardin (March 20-April 19), has been canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak, the two ministers, who are the co-chairmen of the committee, discussed areas of bilateral cooperation through video conference, Iran’s Energy Ministry’s news portal (Paven) published. The two sides also stressed that the meeting of the joint economic committee will be held as soon as the coronavirus pandemic ends and then seriously follow up the objectives of bilateral trade. Meanwhile, they decided that until then both sides pursue the discussed issues through more video conferences. In a joint press conference with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Tehran in January, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that Iran has stood and will stand beside Qatar in the future. “At a juncture of time, certain regional countries imposed restrictions on Qatar, but Iran stood beside Qatar and will stand based on its duties as a neighbor,” Rouhani added. He said that the two countries have a very good relationship in various areas of economy, science, and culture. For his part, the Qatari emir said that Doha will never forget Tehran’s help in difficult days. “We praise the Islamic Republic of Iran’s stance in recent years, especially when Qatar was under blockade,” the emir said. Sheikh Tamim also called for the expansion of relations. MA/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
