TEHRAN – Iran’s tourism chief has said that a total of 2,000 eco-lodges will be constructed across the country until 2021. Over half of the eco-lodges will be inaugurated by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019) and the rest will come on stream by 2021, CHTN quoted Ali-Asghar Mounesan as saying on Tuesday.   “Each eco-lodge unit averagely generates jobs for seven to eight people so that the scheme could create 160,000 jobs.”  On May 13, government spokesman Mohammad-Baqer Nobakht pledged support for ecotourism by providing loans to applicants seeking to build eco-lodges. Due to a very diverse natural setting, Iran offers a lively and interesting environment to nature lovers. Sightseers may live with a nomad or rural family or enjoy an independent stay and assist with day-to-day village activities, while learning about rustic routines, agriculture, wildlife, traditional art and culture.
