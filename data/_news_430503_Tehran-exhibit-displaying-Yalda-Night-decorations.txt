TEHRAN – Sets of decorative bowls, plates, platters, and salvers, which Iranians traditionally use on the graceful Yalda Night, has been put on show at the headquarters of the Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization in Tehran. The two-week exhibit also showcases all food items usually arranged on a spread known as Sofreh (traditional table cloth available in various materials and patterns), CHTN reported on Sunday. Yalda, which falls on December 21, marks the longest night of the year. It’s a time for pleasant family reunions that entails laughter, merriment and good cheer.
