TEHRAN- Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian restated Iran's adamant opposition to the conflict in Ukraine, noting that the West's unfettered shipments of weaponry to Kiev have made the situation in the former Soviet republic even more difficult. Amir Abdollahian made the statement during a phone call on Thursday with his Finnish counterpart Pekka Haavisto. The two senior diplomats were speaking about recent advances in their countries' relations, current international developments, and certain topics of shared interest. "The Islamic Republic of Iran is against the continuance of war, even in Ukraine," Amir Abdollahian pointed out, adding, "We feel the unrestricted transfer of American and European arms to Ukraine has made the situation more challenging." The Iranian foreign ministry has repeatedly stated that Iran opposes the continuation of the conflict in Ukraine and works to bring the warring parties to a truce. The ministry has also denied claims by the West that Tehran has been supplying drones to Moscow for use in the conflict in Ukraine. Tehran asserts it has established long-standing defense partnership with Moscow and is seeking to resolve the situation in Ukraine via diplomacy. In July, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made the first anti-Iran allegations, claiming that Washington had "information" indicating that the Islamic Republic was getting ready to give Russia "up to several hundred drones, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline" for use in the conflict in Ukraine. Kiev receives a variety of munitions and weapons from the United States and its European allies, stoking the conflict in the former Soviet republic. On February 24, Russia began a "special military operation" in Ukraine with the goal of "demilitarizing" the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which is made up of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics. The two republics split out from Ukraine back in 2014 after a democratically elected Ukrainian government that was pro-Russian had been ousted by a Western-backed government. The largest energy crisis in history has been brought on by the U.S. and its European allies' waves of economic sanctions against Moscow in response to the military operation. Western nations have been giving Ukraine money and sophisticated weaponry worth millions of dollars at the same time, a move that Moscow has repeatedly warned will only make the simmering crisis worse. Anti-Iran sanctions  The Iranian foreign minister also gave his Finnish counterpart an update on the efforts to lift the anti-Tehran sanctions. Haavisto, for his part, expressed gratitude for being informed of the most recent developments in the discussions to lift sanctions and reiterated his support for the renewal of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. Haavisto also brought up the subject of Afghanistan during the phone call and expressed his appreciation for the Islamic Republic in hosting Afghan refugees, saying, "Finland is willing to maintain collaboration with Iran in supporting Afghan refugees and internally displaced Afghans." The 90 years of diplomatic relationships between the two nations were also mentioned, along with the importance of strengthening ties. “Certain Western countries foment violence, terrorism in Iran” In yet another phone call on Friday with Dutch Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra, Amir Abdollahian once more criticized Western hypocrisy about women's rights and human rights as well as Western meddling in Iran’s domestic affairs, stating that these acts have stoked violence and terrorism in Iran. He made the comments in reference to the riots that broke out when a young woman fainted in a police custody in Tehran and died three days later around mid-September. The Iranian minister warned that attempts to agitate Iranian women and youth as well as the use of the media for political purposes are diplomatically "unconstructive." Iran’s chief diplomat emphasized that rioters, terrorists, and those who utilized firearms against police personnel will surely face justice in accordance with Islamic Republic law. Wopke, for his part, underscored the need to enhance consular-level exchanges to address issues involving people of both countries, citing the four centuries of relations between Iran and the Netherlands. The Dutch diplomat also praised his Iranian counterpart's willingness to settle challenges concerning a Dutch person, and urged the continuation of negotiations to strengthen bilateral ties.
