TEHRAN – A senior Russian diplomat who has been involved in the Vienna talks over the 2015 Iran nuclear deal has said the West knows that Tehran’s approach in the nuclear talks is constructive. The diplomat, Mikhail Ulyanov, criticized the West for pushing for a censure resolution against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors.  Describing the resolution as “very untimely,” Ulyanov said Iran’s approach at the Vienna talks is constructive, but the West chose to pass the resolution instead of concluding a deal at the Vienna talks, Fars News reported.  Ulyanov made the remarks in an interview with RIA Novosti, according to Fars News.  The IAEA's Board of Governors passed a resolution on November 17 calling on Iran to cooperate with the Agency in an investigation into the discovery of traces of uranium at three Iranian sites. “The resolution (of the IAEA Board of Governors) was extremely untimely. Nothing has happened at the Vienna talks on the restoration of the JCPOA for several months, and this is largely due to the past midterm elections in the United States,” Ulyanov said, adding, “The elections are over - it's time to get together again and complete the negotiation marathon, there are all the conditions for this.” Underlining Iran’s constructive attitude, the Russia diplomat said, “The Western negotiators are aware of this. But instead of finalizing the deal, they are introducing a resolution that inevitably and at least temporarily undercuts the Vienna negotiation process.” He pointed out that “the paradox is that the resolution was presented by four Western participants in the Vienna talks on the restoration of the nuclear deal, including the U.S., which in the past has shown a slightly more responsible approach than the Europeans.” Iran strongly condemned the resolution and has taken some measures in response to it, including the initiation of uranium enrichment at the Fordow nuclear plant to the purity of 60 percent.  Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said the resolution was tabled with “political aims.” “It was put on the agenda of the U.S. and the European trio, to mount pressures on the Islamic Republic of Iran,” said the spokesman, adding that the resolution was issued while Iran has had the most transparent peaceful nuclear program in the world with regards to the number of the nuclear installations under the supervision of the IAEA worldwide. Kanaani added Tehran has let the Agency conduct the highest number of inspections and verifications. Describing the resolution as a “destructive and irrational move,” Kanaani said unfortunately instrumental use of international organizations against independent nations has turned into a norm in the foreign policy of the West. The spokesman pointed out that the Islamic Republic will never give in to the pressure, reiterating Iran will continue its peaceful nuclear program proportional to its needs and in line with its rights and commitments under the international treaties to which it is a member state. Kanaani then touched on Iran’s response to the resolution. “In response to the recent move by the U.S. and the three European countries in approving the anti-Iran resolution, at the first stage Tehran has put a few measures on the agenda of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) that were implemented on Sunday at the enrichment sites of Martyr Ahmadi Roshan (in Natanz) and Dr. Alimohammadi (in Fordow) with the IAEA inspectors in attendance,” he said in a statement. He concluded, “Any time the Western sides return to their commitments and abide by their obligations, and put an end to the political moves, the Islamic Republic of Iran will react proportionately, while pursuing its inalienable rights.” Iran’s response was quick. According to a statement by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Iran installed a set of the more advanced IR6 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear plant, a move that will further accelerate Iran’s uranium enrichment to the level of 60 percent.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
