TEHRAN — Given Iran’s low volume of imports in pharmaceutical and medical equipment industry, the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal won’t affect the industry, the Ministry of Health spokesman said on Wednesday.  “Due to the technical know-how we possess we do not depend on import and we are capable of manufacturing many pharmaceutical products domestically,” ISNA quoted Harirchi as saying. Harirchi further highlighted that the country has enough foreign exchange reserves and ensured the public that the current conditions won’t raise any problems for the pharmaceutical industry.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
