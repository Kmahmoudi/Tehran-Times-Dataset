TEHRAN – The only way to peace in the Middle East is dependent on a pullout of Americans from the region, an Iranian military official said on Sunday in response to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who called for a shift in Tehran’s conduct during President Rouhani’s second term.

 Massoud Jazayeri, the armed forces deputy chief of staff, said the remarks show that the United States is ignorant of Iran’s policies.
