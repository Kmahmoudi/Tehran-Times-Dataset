TEHRAN – The family of martyr Lt. Gen. Qassem Soleimani has issued a statement calling on the Iranian people to participate massively in the Friday presidential elections. Pointing to the importance of the presidential elections, the family said the Iranian nation is now facing “another test” for upholding “religious democracy”. The statement said from the view of Lt. General Soleimani, who sacrificed his life for Islam and Iran, in elections it is “the Islamic Republic” which is important and political parties and factions come next.   It added today two groups are eying the elections: those who love Iran and the Islamic Revolution, including the proudful resistance front, and the enemies who are against the progress and independence of Iran.
