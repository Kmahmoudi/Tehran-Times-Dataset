TEHRAN - Authorities have imposed restrictions in Indian controlled Kashmir ahead of slain rebel commander Burhan Wani’s second death anniversary on Sunday, while the strike call given by the separatist leadership on Saturday evoked decent response in the valley. The shutdown call was given by the joint resistance leadership (JRL) comprising Kashmir’s three senior separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik against the shifting of senior Hurriyat leader Asiya Andrabi from Srinagar central jail to Delhi. JRL has also given strike call for Sunday to mark Wani’s death anniversary.  Wani, a young rebel commander associated with Hizbul Mujahideen militant outfit, was killed in an encounter with security forces in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district on July 8, 2016. His killing triggered massive protests and prolonged unrest in the strife-torn region, in which more than 85 people were killed and many others injured. Meanwhile, situation remains tense in Kashmir, with the killing of three more civilians in army firing on Saturday. According to reports, three civilians, including a teenage girl, were killed when security forces opened fire at a stone-pelting mob during a cordon and search operation in a south Kashmir village on Saturday. Jammu and Kashmir is presently under Delhi’s rule following the collapse of BJP-PDP coalition last week.
