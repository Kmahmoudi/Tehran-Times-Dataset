TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Monday warned the United States that Iran will take retaliatory action if the U.S. designates the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) a terrorist organization, Mehr reported. Zarif made the remarks at a meeting of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said Ali Najafi Khoshroudi, the spokesman of the committee. The foreign minister “condemned the possible U.S. measure and emphasized that such measure would create lots of dangers,” Khoshroudi said. “Although Iran has not been and will not be seeking tension, but should the U.S. decide to implement the move, Iran will take reciprocal action,” Khoshroudi quoted Zarif as saying. Ahmad Amir-Abadi, a member of the Majlis presiding board, also said the parliament would designate all U.S. bases in the region as terrorist bases should the U.S. go on with such move. “If America implements such measure, the Majlis will pass a two-urgency bill, labeling all American bases in the region as terrorist bases, and the IRGC will be permitted to deal with these bases in a similar way to Daesh terrorist bases,” Amir-Abadi stated. He further added that the Iranian armed forces and the IRGC are a red line for the Iranian nation.
