TEHRAN- Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization (IMIDRO) will put 10 industrial-mining projects worth 19.117 trillion rials (about $455 million) into operation during the Ten-Day Dawn (February 1-10, marking the victory anniversary of the Islamic Revolution). IMIDRO Head Khodadad Gharibpour will inaugurate these projects in the southern province of Fars and southeastern province of Kerman, IMIDRO Public Relations Department announced on Sunday. As reported, the projects will create direct jobs for 1,933 persons. IMIDRO has accomplishing semi-finished projects as its top priority, the head of organization stressed on January 20. Addressing the difficulties for financing such projects, Gharibpour, who is also the deputy industry minister, added that domestic mining sector has the capacity to absorb 16 quadrillion rials (about $380 billion) of the wandering liquidity. “Mining sector relies on domestic knowledge and production equipment so it will be least affected, in comparison with other sectors, by U.S.-led sanction,” he added.
