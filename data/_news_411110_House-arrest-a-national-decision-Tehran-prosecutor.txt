TEHRAN – The Tehran prosecutor said on Tuesday that the house arrest of 2009 post-election opposition leaders is a “national decision”.

 “Many of the related organizations have had a hand in making this decision. Therefore, some people cannot come and say they do not accept the house arrest. Such statements are baseless, because the issue relates to national interests,” Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said, Tabnak reported. Mirhossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi were put under house arrest in February 2011 after months of refusing to accept the presidential election results. SP/PA
