TEHRAN – Iran will react strongly to any U.S. move against the nuclear deal with global powers, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Majlis on Wednesday, according to a parliamentarian who attended the session. “In the closed session, Zarif emphasized that if the Americans take any steps against the nuclear deal the Islamic Republic of Iran will give them a more crushing response,” Shahbaz Hassanpour, a lawmaker representing the city of Sirjan, told reporters after the session. Another lawmaker Behrouz Nemati also said the foreign minister discussed specific steps Trump and the U.S. Congress might take, and Iran’s plans for reciprocal action to each anticipated U.S. move. Nemati did not say what actions Zarif had proposed. SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
