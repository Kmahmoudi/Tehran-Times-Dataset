TEHRAN – Iranian worshipers staged massive demonstrations on Friday to express their solidarity with Palestinians and Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The demonstrations, which were held after weekly Friday prayers, saw people from all walks of life condemning the heinous crimes committed against Muslims in Myanmar and the occupied Palestinian territories. Holding anti-Israel placards during the rallies, the protesters shouted: “Death to Israel”, “Defending Palestine is Our Honor”, “Death to Zionism; Death to England; Death to America; Death to Al Saud Traitors.” The demonstrators also called for unity among Muslims in order to counter the hegemonic countries headed by the United States. A statement was released at the end of the rallies, denouncing the atrocities committed by the Zionists against the innocent Palestinian people in the occupied territories and the brutal killings of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. “The Zionist regime is afraid of Palestinians’ Intifada and their resistance against such inauthentic regime,” read part of the statement. “Israel is trying to rule over al Aqsa Mosque and all Palestine and has spared no deceit and crime in achieving this goal.” The statement condemned the deafening silence of the international community over the crimes committed against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, saying, “The massacre of Muslims across the world shows the false claims of human rights advocates.” It also called on Iran’s Foreign Ministry to reflect the Iranian people’s protest against such crimes to the world and take a firm stance to defend the rights of innocent Muslims in Myanmar.
