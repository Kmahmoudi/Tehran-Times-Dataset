TEHRAN - Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, told a gathering of Basij forces in Tehran on Sunday that resistance fronts have been formed in regional countries and the wider world.
 “Today, the global mobilization force of the Islamic front has been established,” Tasnim quoted Jafari as saying. The commander said the Lebanese Hezbollah resistance movement has made achievements by using the experiences of Basij in Iran. Jafari also pointed to Iran’s advisory missions in Iraq and Syria, saying the recent victories of the resistance forces over foreign-backed terrorists was the result of the presence of Iranian advisers and commanders as well as the countries’ popular forces. Armed forces in Iraq and Syria, backed by popular mobilization units and Iranian military advisors, have managed to flush Daesh militants out of their last strongholds in both countries, declaring full victory over the notorious group.
