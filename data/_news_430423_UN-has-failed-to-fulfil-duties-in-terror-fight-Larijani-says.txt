TEHRAN – Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said on Saturday that the United Nations Security Council has failed to carry out its duties regarding the fight against terrorism, Mehr reported. Larijani made the remarks during a conference of six regional countries on ways to combat the threat of terrorism. One of the main reasons for holding this regional meeting is that the UN Security Council is not performing its duties in the campaign against terrorism, he told the participants including parliament speakers from Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Russia, and Turkey. He also denounced as “dangerous” the unilateral measures adopted by U.S. President Donald Trump, saying Washington’s policies commercialize human rights and humanitarian values which have taken many years to develop. He added despite their claims of fighting terrorism, the U.S. and its allies in the region have spread terrorism. The parliament speaker expressed the hope that the conference on counter-terrorism would play an active role in promoting regional security. Larijani also held separate meetings with his Turkish and Afghan counterparts to discuss a range of regional and international issues, including ways to combat terrorism. Meeting Turkish Parliament Speaker Binali Yildirim, he said mutual cooperation to boost security in the Middle East has increased. He blamed the U.S. government for regional instability, saying Washington’s behavior has created “an international disorder”. At the meeting with his Afghan counterpart, Abdul Rauf Ibrahimi, Larijani said there is no military solution to the Afghan conflict. “Afghanistan’s issue can only be settled politically.” “Terrorism and drugs are the two blades of a scissors and we hope these issues would be resolved in Afghanistan as soon as possible through political means,” he emphasized. He further underlined the importance of enhancing cooperation in various fields, especially in combating drug smuggling and terrorism.
