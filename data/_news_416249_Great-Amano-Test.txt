The recent visit of the United States representative of the Security Council to the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and her visit to Yukiya Amano has been addressed by the authorities of our country. Obviously, Washington's pressure on the IAEA to inspect Iran's military sites is a real violation of the JCPOA and UN Security Council resolution 2231. Beyond that, it means Washington's public blackmail from Amano and other Agency officials. During the nuclear negotiations between Iran and 1 + 5, the issue of inspection of Iranian military sites became one of the key issues in the talks. Even the controversy over the issue between the parties led to a prolonged process of reaching a nuclear deal. However, Ayatollah Khamenei at the time emphasized that the inspection of military places in our country is considered Iran’s red line. After victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and his move to the White House, he set up a committee to examine how to quit and disrupt the nuclear deal. Trump has the intention of breaking the nuclear deal under the pretext of organizing an inspection of Iran's military sites by the IAEA. Over the past weeks, some U.S. media have said it is scheduled to accuse Iran of violating a nuclear deal in October, in a White House’s to Congress. Yukiya Amano’s silence about Nikki Haley’s trip has a clear message for many people who have watched his approach in recent years! The reality is that Amano's approach to the IAEA has been a function of pressures and political games, rather than being dependent on the legal principles. However, Amano and his entourage face a tough test. If Amano succumb to the pressures of the U.S and the government of Trump, it will be one of the main factors behind the collapse of the nuclear deal. In this case, Amano should be responsive to non-impartial performance against one of the most important international agreements. What is certain is that Amano's performance and other Agency officials are under the pretext of public opinion in Iran and the world.
