TEHRAN – The National Iranian Tanker Company has signed 70 deals since the removal of sanctions in January 2016 for leasing out tankers to large foreign companies.
 The deals have been mainly made with European and Asian companies, Shana reported on Tuesday, quoting NITC Managing Director Sirous Kianersi as saying. He said the implementation of the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has had a key influence on the activity of NITC as the company’s tankers have been moving comfortably in the international waters since the nuclear deal took effect. Removing problems related to insurance and ranking were some other fruits of JCPOA, he said, adding, “NITC is currently shipping the oil produced by some Italian and Spanish companies and is negotiating with Polish refiners in this regard as well.”
 
Kianersi touched on renovating the company’s fleet benefiting from domestic capabilities, saying that no plans are underway for increasing the number of tankers. NITC, which operates the largest tanker fleet in the Middle East and has the world’s largest fleet of super tankers, transports Iranian crude and also acts as an independent entity in contracts with foreign concerns for crude oil transportation based on prevailing international freight rates.
