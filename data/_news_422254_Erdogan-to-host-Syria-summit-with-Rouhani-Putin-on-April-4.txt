Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will host a trilateral summit on Syria on April 4 with the participation of his Iranian and Russian counterparts Hassan Rouhani and Vladimir Putin, the Turkish Presidential Press Office said in a statement on March 31.  According to Anadolu Agency, besides regional developments and the ongoing Syrian war, the Turkish and Iranian leaders are also expected to hold talks to discuss bilateral relations. Turkey, Russia and Iran are the guarantor countries who brokered a cease-fire in Syria in December 2016, leading to the Astana talks in the Kazakh capital, which are being held parallel to the United Nations-backed discussions in Geneva, to find a political solution to the eight-year conflict.
