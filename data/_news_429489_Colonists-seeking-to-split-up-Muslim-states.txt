TEHRAN – Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani on Monday emphasized the importance of unity within the Islamic Ummah, saying Muslims should focus on their commonalities to strengthen unity and counter the enemies. Speaking at a meeting ahead of the unity week, Amoli Larijani said colonial countries have long sought to divide Muslims and split up Muslim countries, ISNA reported. “They have intensified their divide and rule policy today,” he warned. He also expressed the hope that rulers of regional countries take measures to boost unity among Muslim nations.   MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
