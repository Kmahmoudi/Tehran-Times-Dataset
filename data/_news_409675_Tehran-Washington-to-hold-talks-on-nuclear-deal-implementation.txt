TEHRAN – Tehran and Washington are to hold a meeting on issues concerning the implementation of the nuclear deal, a day before deputy foreign ministers of 5+1 countries and Iran gather to meet to assess a complaint by Iran that the new U.S. Congress move goes against the nuclear deal, ISNA reported on Sunday.
 It is the sixth time that the countries signing the nuclear deal are coming together since the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was clinched on July 14, 2015. According to ISNA, Iran and the 5+1 countries plan to hold the meeting in Vienna on January 10 to review the issues raised in a letter that Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote to EU Foreign Policy chief Feredrica Mogherini on December 16, over Washington’s extension of sanctions against Iran for another ten years. Zarif’s call came after Tehran announced the latest renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) by the U.S. Congress runs counter to the terms of the nuclear agreement. “To maintain the integrity and coherence of BARJAM (Persian acronym for the nuclear deal) as well as its durability, all parties to BARJAM need to pay attention to continuous implementation of its content,” Zarif said The forthcoming meeting between Tehran and Washington will be held at the expert levels on both nuclear and sanctions issues. It is likely the last time that a representative from the Obama administration will attend the JCPOA-related meetings as Donald Trump will take the helm on January 20. Trump, on numerous occasions during his presidential campaign, criticized the nuclear deal, promising to renegotiate the terms of the agreement if elected president. However, his remarks has received criticism by world leaders, including Mogherini. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
