TEHRAN - Head of Iranian delegation at Astana talks Hossein Jaberi Ansari told MNA that ISIL is on the verge of physical collapse although their ideology will remain.   Deputy FM Hossein Jaberi Ansari who heads Iranian delegation at the Syrian settlement negotiations in Astana told Mehr News correspondent that “the military and operational objectives of ISIL terrorists are heading toward failure,” as major parts of occupied lands in Iraq and Syria have been already liberated from ISIL. “The ideology and political objectives of these terrorist groups will remain, however,” he stressed. He went on to add, “once militarily defeated, these terrorists will try to find other ways to carry out anti-security measures to destabilize countries, therefore it is imperative for regional governments to keep vigilant in order to contain them.” Jaberi Ansari noted four levels of combating terrorism, including 1) ideological and cultural, 2) economic and social, 3) security and intelligence, and 4) military and field operations, stressing that all these four levels must be utilized for an effective fight against terrorism. The Iranian diplomat went on to add, “one of the factors responsible for the escalation of extremism in region and beyond is the intentional policy and strategic mistake of certain regional and international actors for making instrumental use of terrorism to achieve their political goals.” Jaberi Ansari further stressed that the formation of a regional or international coalition against terrorism and putting a stop to the instrumental use of terrorism can help expedite the eradication of extremist and extremist groups.
