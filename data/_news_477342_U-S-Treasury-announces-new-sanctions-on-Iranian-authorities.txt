TEHRAN- The U.S. slapped sanctions on a number of Iranian officials, including interior minister and ICT minister. Following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran around mid-September, the Biden administration imposed further sanctions against Iranian officials for what it called "violent suppression of protestors." Iranian police have denied that Amini was beaten in custody but her case sparked protests in certain cities across the country.  The sanctions announced on Thursday are directed at Iran's interior and communications ministries, Ahmad Vahidi and Eisa Zarepour, as well as Vahid Mohammad Naser Majid, the chief of the country's cyber-police unit, and four other security personnel. Iran's morality police was placed on a sanctions list by the U.S. Department of the Treasury after it was purportedly charged with "violence against women." The U.S. pinned the blame on the morality police in the statement for Amini's passing without offering any supporting evidence. Based on the statement issued by the U.S. Treasury, this decision was taken after prominent Iranian officials and morality police were added to the U.S. Treasury's sanctions list on September 22. The sanctioned people were allegedly involved in "violence against peaceful protestors and the blocking of Iran's internet access," according to Treasury Department. The restrictions avert the Iranian officials' assets from being held in the U.S. and forbid international financial organizations from conducting business with them. Earlier this week, Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei blamed the protests on Israel and the United States.
