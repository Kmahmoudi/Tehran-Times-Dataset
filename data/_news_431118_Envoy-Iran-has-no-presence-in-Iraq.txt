TEHRAN – Tehran's Ambassador to Baghdad, Iraj Masjedi, said on Tuesday that Iran has no military presence, bases, or even advisory presence in Iraq.  Masjedi said all Iranian advisors who helped the Iraqi government to defeat Daesh (ISIL) returned to the country after announcing the victory against the terrorist group, IRNA reported. Unlike the Islamic Republic, he said, the United States continues to maintain its forces in the region, and in some places it has been strengthening its military bases instead of pulling its forces out of Iraq. Late in 2017, Iraq officially announced its victory against Daesh. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
