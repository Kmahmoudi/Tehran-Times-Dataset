TEHRAN – Selling raw material results in disregarding human resources, which is very destructive, the vice president for science and technology said. Sourena Sattari said that the country cannot be managed with selling raw materials and oil money, IRNA reported. It is environment and culture, not money, which creates a knowledge-based economy, he noted. Innovation and human resources result in wealth creation in knowledge-based economies, he said. Money cannot create innovation but it can have a crucial role, he said. He extolled the culture of entrepreneurship in which, education leads to big scientists and production. “The knowledge economy paves the way for the private sector to be influential in research.” The 3rd and 4th generation of universities is based on the private sector and this is possible if it is considered beneficial for private companies, he said. “Our young generation can change oil economy, which pays attention to money rather than what is in your mind,” he lamented. He named innovation and knowledge as the values for entrepreneurship. “We should convince the private sector that it is beneficial to invest in human resources and young generation, in this way many things may change,” he concluded.
