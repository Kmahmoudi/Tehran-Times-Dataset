TEHRAN- Gasoline production in Iran has risen 50 percent since the beginning of current Iranian calendar year (March 21) compared to the same period of time in the previous year, according to the managing director of National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (NIOPDC). Alireza Sadeqabadi put the country’s average daily gasoline output at 93 million liters during the 4.5-month period of this year, Shana news agency reported. On Saturday, Alireza Arman Moqadam, the director for consolidated planning in NIOPDC, announced that Iran’s daily gasoline production will hit the record of 95.5 million liters in the coming days. In mid-December last year, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said: “Iran will reach a stable status in gasoline production once the second phase of Persian Gulf Star Refinery comes on stream.” The second phase of the refinery (in south of Iran), was inaugurated by President Hassan Rouhani in late June, and on July 28, Mohammad-Ali Dadvar, the managing director of refinery, announced that its daily gasoline production has increased 2 million liters to stand at 26 million liters. The refinery in the southern province of Hormozgan is the first of its kind designed based on gas condensate feedstock. It is projected to be complete by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019) and once fully operational, the refinery will add over 36 million liters of Euro-4 and Euro-5 quality gasoline to the country’s gasoline production capacity to increase it to 100 million liters per day.
