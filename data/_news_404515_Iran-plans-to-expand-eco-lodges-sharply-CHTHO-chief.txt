TEHRAN – Iran plans to sharply increase the number of ecol-lodges across the country in the next four years, Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicraft Organization Director Masoud Soltanifar said.
 There were just below 40 eco-lodges nationwide three years ago, he said, adding that currently about 300 eco-lodges are in different parts of the country. “We plan to increase the number of eco-lodges to 2,000, of which and 20 to 30 percent will be in Lut Desert,” IRIB quoted Soltanifar as saying. Eco-lodge is a type of tourist accommodation designed to have the minimum possible impact on the natural environment in which it is situated. It is usually located in a natural area, or in a rural area within a short distance to a natural area, and is not significantly impacted by a townsite, noise, traffic, smog or pollution. Lut Desert was registered on the World Heritage List during 40th session of the World Heritage Committee in Istanbul last week. Now Iran is proud of 21 UNESCO registered sites, which is a great step for attraction of more tourists, he said. “Besides, with global registration, the sites would be under spotlight by world research and tourist centers,” he added. About 60 historical and natural places in Iran have factors for global registration, Soltanifar said. “We have nominees for UNESCO registration until 30-40 years on,” he said. In a speech in October 2015, Soltanifar announced that Iran president has is preparing for a “tsunami” of foreign holidaymakers as world powers begin to lift sanctions against the country. Iran aims to host 20 million tourists a year by 2025 and is currently trying to remove obstacles for tourists to acquire visas.
