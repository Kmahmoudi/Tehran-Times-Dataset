TEHRAN – A public campaign has been launched aimed at creating jobs for socially vulnerable women nearly two months before the new Iranian year starts on March 20. The campaign with the motto of “Presenting a job, as the new year’s gift” is arranged by the Society of Awareness, Knowledge and Growth (Bavar NGO) to create job opportunities for the women who are the breadwinners of their families, Mehr News Agency reported. Bavar NGO has been providing cloths and foods for children of the needy families in the ending month of the year over the past 10 years. This year, the Bavar NGO plans to establish a house of business to provide consultative and social work services for vulnerable women. They will be trained in different workshops in the fields of jewelries, pottery, sewing and leather works based on their talents. The campaign invites generous people to bestow their charities to create jobs for vulnerable women.
