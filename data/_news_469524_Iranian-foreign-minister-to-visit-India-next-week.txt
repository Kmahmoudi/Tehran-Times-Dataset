TEHRAN - India is expected to host Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian next week, close on the heels of the India-Central Asia summit, the Economic Times reported on Wednesday. This would be the Iranian foreign minister’s maiden visit since his appointment last year. The agenda of the visit will include the Afghan situation, transit to Afghanistan and Central Asia, current developments in West Asia following the UAE-Yemen battle and trade ties, according to people aware of the matter. The other issue that will figure high on the agenda of talks between the visiting minister and his Indian counterpart is the optimum use of Chabahar Port.  India is extremely keen to use the port for connectivity to Central Asia. India, Iran and Afghanistan had entered into a trilateral arrangement for the use of Chabahar Port under the erstwhile Ghani government. Later, India-Iran-Uzbekistan formed a trilateral for the use of the strategically located port and there was speculation that Afghanistan might join to make it a quadrilateral of sorts. The agenda of the Iranian foreign minister's maiden visit to India will include the Afghan situation, transit to Afghanistan and Central Asia, and current developments in West Asia. Besides, a preferential trade agreement with Iran is on the cards. India is keen to push the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) for connectivity to Russia via Iran. There are plans by India, Iran and Russia to link the Chabahar Port with the INSTC which would also enable the Central Asian states to access the Indian Ocean Region via the port. Iran’s entry into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as a member could further bolster India-Iran ties in the region. Iran, like India, favors an inclusive regime in Kabul that comprises representatives from all ethnic communities. The issue is expected to figure high on the agenda of Jaishankar’s meeting with Amir Abdollahian. The two had met twice last year. Ahead of the visit, Amir Abdollahian sent Republic Day greetings and called for expansion of all-out relations.  “Warm wishes to my colleague Indian FM@DrSJaishankar and the government and people of the Republic of India as they celebrate their Republic Day. Will continue to work towards further expansion of all-out relations, bilaterally, regionally and at international fora,” he tweeted on Tuesday.
