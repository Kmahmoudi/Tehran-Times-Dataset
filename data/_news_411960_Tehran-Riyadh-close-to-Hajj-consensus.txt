TEHRAN – Tehran and Riyadh will be finalizing a framework by the summer which ends a two-year hiatus in performing Hajj rituals by Iranian pilgrims, according to a senior Iranian official. 

 “So far, intended agreements have been reached with the Saudi side,” the Leader's representative for Hajj and Pilgrimage Affairs Ali Ghazi Askar said on Tuesday.  If the two sides agree on remaining issues, upwards of 80,000 Iranian pilgrims will be dispatched to Mecca, the official added.   Iran stopped its Hajj program after 446 Iranians were killed during a 2015 stampede in Mina.  SP/PA
