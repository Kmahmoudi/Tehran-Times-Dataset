Iran’s ambassador to the UN said on Monday that extension of the Iran Sanctions Act runs contrary to obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly called the nuclear deal.
 “The recent action by the United States in extending sanctions against Iran, clearly runs counter to its commitments under the JCPOA. We urge the U.S. administration to swiftly resolve concerns that the above-mentioned action has caused,” Gholamali Khoshroo told the UN General Assembly. Following is the text of Khoshroo’s speech posted on the Foreign Ministry website: In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful Mr. President, At the outset, I would like to thank the distinguished Director General of the IAEA for his report. The Islamic Republic of Iran, once again, underlines the role and responsibility of the IAEA in facilitating the full realization of the inalienable right of all NPT States Parties to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including their right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Recalling the statutory functions and primary responsibility of the Agency to assist Member States in research on, and practical application of, nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and appreciating its related activities, Iran stresses the need for further enhancement of such activities, particularly to meet the expectations of developing Member States. In this context, and taking into account the growing applications of nuclear energy and the role it plays in the socio-economic development of societies, Iran is determined to vigorously continue to exercise its inalienable right to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy, including development of a full national nuclear fuel cycle, for peaceful purposes. In regard to the role and functions of the IAEA in implementing the safeguards agreements, Iran would like to stress that all such activities should be carried out in full conformity with the relevant legally-binding instruments, and take into account the concerns and interests of Member States, in particular, by strict observance of the principle of confidentiality. Mr. President, With regard to the IAEA's verification and monitoring activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the distinguished Director-General of the IAEA in all his past four reports to the Board of Governors in 2016 have certified Iran's full compliance with its Safeguards Agreement's obligations and the complete fulfillment of its commitments under the JCPOA. While the Islamic Republic of Iran has fully implemented its commitments, as verified by the IAEA and acknowledged by all JCPOA participants, other parties are also obliged to genuinely carry out their commitments under the JCPOA and refrain from any action inconsistent with its letter, spirit and intent. The recent action by the United States in extending sanctions against Iran, clearly runs counter to its commitments under the JCPOA. We urge the U.S. administration to swiftly resolve concerns that the above-mentioned action has caused. Iran has been and will remain fully committed to the JCPOA as a multilateral instrument. However, it is crystal clear that ensuring the continued viability of the JCPOA requires the full and timely fulfillment by ALL JCPOA participants, not just Iran, of their commitments. Indeed, it is in the interest of the international community and all JCPOA participants.
