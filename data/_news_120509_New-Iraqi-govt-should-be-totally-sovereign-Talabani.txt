“Our aim is to attain independence and unity, and no ethnic group, language, or religion will be excluded in the Iraqi government,” he told the Mehr News Agency in an exclusive interview. “The government should include the representatives of all political parties,” he added. “We are determined to establish a democratic and free system in the country. I believe that all Iraqis should enjoy fair and equal rights.” Talabani went on to say that the Iraqi Constitution is based on the principles of human rights and all Iraqi groups are in consensus on it. Asked about the relationship between religion and the government, he said, “Our religion will be Islam, and we will act in accordance with religious democracy and freedom.” All political parties have agreed that Iraq should be a federal republic, he noted. He also stated that Iraqi religious leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has played a very positive role in supporting the government. Talabani said that Ayatollah Sistani is a thoughtful supervisor but does not interfere in Iraq’s political affairs.
