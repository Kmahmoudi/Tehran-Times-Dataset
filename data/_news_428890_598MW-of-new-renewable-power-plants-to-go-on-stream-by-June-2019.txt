TEHRAN – Iran’s Energy Ministry plans to add 598 megawatts (MW) of new renewable power plants to the country’s current 650MW by the beginning of Iranian calendar’s next summer (June 21, 2019), IRNA reported on Tuesday. As planned, 102.4 megawatts capacity of wind power plants, 437 megawatts of solar power plants, 14.4 megawatts of biomass plants, 32.6 megawatts of small hydroelectric power plants, as well as 11.4 megawatts of waste heat recovery plants will be constructed within the mentioned time span, adding 598 megawatts of new capacity to the country’s current power generation capacity. Earlier this month, Iran’s Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian said the country’s renewable capacity is going to reach 1100MW by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019). Of the country’s current active renewable power plants 65 units are big-scale power plants while over 2000 small-scale ones comprise the rest. Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence in the regional electricity market. Renewables, including hydropower, account for just six percent of energy generation, versus natural gas’ 90 percent share.
