TEHRAN - Air France and Dutch flagship KLM will restart their weekly flights to Tehran on April 17 and May 1, respectively, said Hamidreza Seyyedi, an official with Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport. Air France will resume flights to Iran after an eight-year hiatus due to sanctions on the Islamic Republic. KLM suspended flights to Iran in 2013. Air France flights will take off four times per week (Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), Seyyedi said, adding, KLM flights will take off three times per week (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday), the IRNA news agency reported.
