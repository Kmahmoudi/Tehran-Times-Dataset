TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Bakir Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina, held a joint press conference in Tehran on Tuesday, highlighting the importance of expanding relations.
 “The relations between the two countries have always been friendly since the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and this trip [Izetbegovic’ visit to Iran] will be a starting point to expand relations,” Rouhani explained. There is many good opportunities for the two countries to expand relations given the removal of sanctions against Iran now that nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, has gone into effect, Rouhani added. Rouhani also pointed to “peaceful coexistence” among the Muslims, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, saying it can lay the grounds for the country’s peace and stability. He expressed hope that Izetbegovic’s visit to Iran would be a good start to increase ties within the framework of the two countries’ national interests. Izetbegovic said relations with Iran is “growing” based on mutual interests. Iran can enter Europe’s business market through Bosnia and Herzegovina, he said. He also said the sanctions against Iran had impeded expansion of relations, but the nuclear agreement has opened the door for the two sides to deepen their ties. Elsewhere, he called Islam religion of “peace, stability and mercy” and said those who seek to ruin the image of Islam have nothing to do with the religion. Izetbegovic arrived in Tehran on Monday. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding to expand cooperation between small and medium enterprises and industrial parks. NA/PA
