TEHRAN – Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, announced on Monday Iran has made due decisions to return to the pre-JCPOA status.

 Shamkhani made the remarks in a meeting with the visiting British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in Tehran. Shamkhani said the decisions have been made in response to the inactivity of the remaining parties to the nuclear deal after the U.S. withdrew from it. “In view of the passiveness of the other parties in the face of the unseemly language and behavior of the United States, the Islamic Republic of Iran, based on its own national interests and responsibilities, has adopted necessary decisions to return to the pre-agreement status,” Shamkhani asserted.  The remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, are the three European Union trio of Germany, Britain and France as well as Russia and China.
  
Shamkhani said the nuclear talks that led to the JCPOA were hosted and facilitated by the European Union and now the violation of the deal means that the U.S. has soiled the EU’s credibility, he said. The security chief also criticized the UK for hosting media organizations that recently supported terrorist groups that launched a bloody attack in Ahvaz, the capital of southwestern Khuzestan province. Shamkhani also expressed contempt for the UK’s double-standard policy on the Middle East, specifically for arming Saudi Arabia and Bahrain with notorious records for violating human rights.
