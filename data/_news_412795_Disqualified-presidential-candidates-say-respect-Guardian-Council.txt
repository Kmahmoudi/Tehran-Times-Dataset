TEHRAN – Alireza Zakani and Hamidreza Hajibabaei who were disqualified by the Guardian Council to run for the May presidential election, issued separate announcements on Friday saying they will respect the decision and abide by law. The overseeing body qualified only six out of a pool of more than 1600 applicants. Zakani and Hajibabaei, coupled with three more, were introduced by the country’s conservative camp who formed a new political group called "Popular Front of the Islamic Republic Forces", planning to unite their ranks behind one candidate.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
