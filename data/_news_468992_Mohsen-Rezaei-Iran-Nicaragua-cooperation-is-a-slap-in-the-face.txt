Rezaei called the U.S. interference in the internal affairs of countries an insult to nations and stressed, “In this situation, governments and nations that want freedom and resistance must work together and help develop each other's welfare and development by expanding comprehensive relations.” He added that resistant governments and nations, through strengthening and developing relations and cooperation, can prove to the world that having a revolutionary spirit is in line with economic progress. Referring to the vast capabilities of Iran and Nicaragua, the vice president said that Iran is ready to comprehensively develop relations between the two countries and exchange experiences in various technical fields, including oil and energy, petrochemicals, refinery construction, and construction and development of ports and forming joint ventures. Rezaei praised the efforts to establish a joint Iran-Nicaragua bank and exchange experiences in the field of economic, commercial and academic research and studies.
