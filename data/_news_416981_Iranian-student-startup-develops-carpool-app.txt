TEHRAN — ‘Mibarim’ (literally meaning we take you) is a student startup promoting carpooling application designed by Iranian students to reduce air pollution.
 Carpooling (also car-sharing, ride-sharing and lift-sharing) is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in cars. Today, with persistent air pollution in mega cities many are starting to think that sharing the same car would be beneficial both to them and the environment.  By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person's travel costs such as fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces air pollution, carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. However, carpooling is not very popular in Iran yet. Startups such as ‘Mibarim’ are now trying to gain more attention to this efficient method of commuting.  On the occasion of the World Car Free Day, September 22, the developers of the app have decided to call on those who are interested to reserve a car to Nature Bridge (Tabi'at Bridge), a pedestrian overpass in Tehran, or Tehran Book garden for free to encourage people to use the app in the future.  By visiting the website http://mibarim.com/ you can either download the app as the passenger or become a driver and share your car with others to have cleaner air and shinier sun.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
