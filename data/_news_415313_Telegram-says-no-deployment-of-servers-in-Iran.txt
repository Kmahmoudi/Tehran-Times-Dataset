TEHRAN – The Russian creator of Telegram messenger has denied reports about deploying servers in Iran.

 Pavel Durov said such reports are “hardly worth commenting on,” frontnews.eu reported on Sunday. “Telegram, which respects a strict policy of confidentiality, cannot fulfill such requirements of any states,” Durov stressed. The comments followed Iranian Deputy ICT Minister Nasrollah Jahangard saying foreign social apps are required to transfer their servers to Iran if they wish to continue offering service in the country.  SP/PA
