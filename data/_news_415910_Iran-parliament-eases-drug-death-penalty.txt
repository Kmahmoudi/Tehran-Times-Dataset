TEHRAN - Iran's parliament passed a long-awaited amendment to its drug trafficking laws on Sunday, raising the thresholds that can trigger capital punishment. 
 The bill must still be approved by the Guardian Council but gained parliamentary approval after months of debate. 
The new law raises the amounts that can trigger the death penalty from 30 grams to two kilos for the production and distribution of chemical substances such as heroin, cocaine and amphetamines.
For natural substances such as opium and marijuana, the levels have been raised from five to 50 kilos. AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
