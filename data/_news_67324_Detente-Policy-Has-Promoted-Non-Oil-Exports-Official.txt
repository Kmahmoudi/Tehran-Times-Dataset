He added with cooperation between the government and the Parliament, non-oil exports have been on the rise and favorable opportunities have been created for foreign investment. Khosrotaj said the establishment of associations of Iranian businessmen in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries is a useful measure which can contribute to the promotion of exports.
