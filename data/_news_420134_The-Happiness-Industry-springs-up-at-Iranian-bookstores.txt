TEHRAN – British writer William Davies’s “The Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business Sold Us Well-Being” has been published in Persian in Tehran.

 Azam Varshochi is the translator of the book, which has been published by Parseh Books. In a fascinating investigation combining history, science and ideas, Davies shows how well-being influences all aspects of our lives: business, finance, marketing and smart technology.  This book will make you rethink everything from the way you work, the power of the “Nudge,” the ever-expanding definitions of depression, and the commercialization of your most private feelings.  “The Happiness Industry” is a shocking and brilliantly argued warning about the new religion of the age: our emotions. “Deeply researched and pithily argued, Davies’s work is a welcome corrective to the glut of semi-scientific happiness books that have become so popular in business and management circles, and which rarely, if ever, acknowledge the larger ideological goals of workplace well-being,” the New York Magazine reviewed.
