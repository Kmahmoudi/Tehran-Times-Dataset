TEHRAN – The cultural advisor to Iran’s president has argued President-elect Donald Trump will try to act in a way that force Iran to violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the official name for the nuclear deal.

 “Doing so, Trump will seek excuses that it will need to introduce, extend or intensify sanctions against Iran,” Hesamoddin Ashna tweeted on Thursday. “Everyone, opponents and proponents of the government, should consider national interests… and refrain from any action that would provide America with any alibi,” he stressed.
