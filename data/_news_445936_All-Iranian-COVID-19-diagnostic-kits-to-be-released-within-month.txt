TEHRAN – Iran will commercialize domestically-made COVID-19 diagnostic kits by the Iranian calendar month of Farvardin (March 21-April 22), secretary of biotechnology development of Vice Presidency for Science and Technology announced. Following a call by the headquarters for the production of COVID-19 diagnostic kits, a contract was signed with five knowledge-based companies and manufacturing process began, ISNA quoted Mostafa Qane’ei as saying on Monday. Diagnosis is the most important part of coronavirus treatment, he highlighted.  Patients suspected to coronavirus are currently being identified by diagnostic kits that have entered Iran in the form of assistance and purchases by the World Health Organization, China and UNICEF, he said. So, the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology decided to manufacture the kits domestically, he noted.

Deputy health minister Kianoush Jahanpour said that at least 7,161 people have so far been infected in the country. Of the total figure, 2,394 have been recovered and 237 have died.
