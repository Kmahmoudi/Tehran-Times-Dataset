The Sixth Five-Year Economic Development Plan (2016-2021) has passed some bills for preventing social vulnerabilities and the budget allocated for the program, ISNA quoted Iranian member of Majlis (Iranian Parliament), Farideh Olad Qobad, as saying. An amount of 2.3 trillion rials (nearly $54 million) was allocated for preventing social vulnerabilities in the current year's budget, said Olad Qobad.  Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation and Iran Welfare Organization are supporting women heads of families, she said, noting women living in special situation should not be forgotten. According to statistics released in 2017, there are around 2.5 million breadwinner women in the country, including 180,000 families, making up 500,000 people.
