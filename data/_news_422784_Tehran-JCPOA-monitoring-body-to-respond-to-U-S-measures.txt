TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Wednesday that the nuclear deal monitoring body will respond to any U.S. measures aimed at destroying the nuclear agreement, also called the JCPOA. Pointing out that the body has not made a statement on the issue yet, Qassemi said the body will take necessary measures at the right time and will report to the public, ISNA reported. The JCPOA was struck on July 14, 2015 between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council – the United States, France, Britain, China, Russia – plus Germany. Under the pact, Iran put some restriction on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
