TEHRAN – Ayatollah Kazem Seddiqi, the interim Friday prayer preacher of Tehran, has likened the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to the Capitulation Law, warning Iranian authorities to beware of the hegemonic powers’ plots in pushing for its ratification. “We hope our authorities do not allow such laws to be enacted in the country … They should learn from the Leader’s guidance, who said beware of the plots hatched in the think tanks of the arrogance (hegemonic powers) to be used against us, because they are after colonialism.” Seddiqi told worshippers in Tehran on Friday. On October 7, Majlis (Parliament) approved the bill. However, the oversight Guardian Council has refused to endorse it, finding 20 faults with it.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
