TEHRAN – Mohammad Reza Naqdi, the newly-appointed deputy coordinator of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), has hailed the IRGC as a successful model in the Islamic world, saying other countries want to have an organization like the IRGC as well. Naqdi made the remarks on Sunday at a ceremony to introduce the newly-appointed commanders of the IRGC. “Today, there is no honor higher than serving in the Guards,” he said, Tasnim reported. IRGC emerged as a strong force against Daesh and other vicious groups in Iraq and Syria.  Last month, the United States designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. The measure elicited some angry reactions in Iran, where the parliament passed a bill designating U.S. forces in the region, including CENTCOM, the U.S. central commands in the Persian Gulf region, as a terrorist group.
