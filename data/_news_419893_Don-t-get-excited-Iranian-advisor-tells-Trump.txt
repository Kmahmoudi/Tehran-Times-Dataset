TEHRAN – Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, has responded to U.S. President Donald Trump’s meddlesome remarks about the recent protests in Iran. In a tweet on Sunday, Amir-Abdollahian told Trump: “Do not get excited. Sedition, unrest and chaos are different from gatherings and peaceful protests to pursue people's demands.” “The Iranian people prefer national security and religious democracy of the Islamic system to the domination of the White House's hypocritical and terrorist policies.” In a tweet on Friday, Trump said the Iranian government should “respect their people's rights, including right to express themselves.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
