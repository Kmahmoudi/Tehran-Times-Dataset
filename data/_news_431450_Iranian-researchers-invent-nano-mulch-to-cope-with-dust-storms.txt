TEHRAN – Researchers at the School of Marine Science and Ocean of Khorramshahr, southwestern Iran, have invented nano-mulch to deal with dust storms. The environment-friendly product is based on sugarcane extract and is biodegradable. Nano-mulch improves soil resistance to erosion and increases its fertility, IRIB reported on January 1. The dust storms descend on Iran from the deserts and dried-up ponds of Iraq and Saudi Arabia.  Many ponds which were once located in the arid and desert regions stretching from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea to Iran have gone dry over the years. This ongoing desertification process has greatly increased the number of dust storms in the region and every year heavy dust storms envelope more than half of the country.  SB/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
