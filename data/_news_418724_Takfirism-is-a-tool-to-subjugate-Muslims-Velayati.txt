TEHRAN – Top Iranian politician Ali Akbar Velayati said on Wednesday that Takfirism is a tool for enemies to subjugate Muslim countries. Velayati, a senior advisor to Leader of the Islamic Revolution and chairman of the Islamic Awakening International Assembly, made the remarks in an anti-Takfirism forum in Tehran. Velayati said Takfirism was employed to counter Islamic Awakening. The ill-wishers are seeking to paint a dark picture of Islam based on the Wahhabi model by revitalizing the pre-Islamic era ignorance, which allowed reprehensible atrocities such as beheading children, immolating men, and assaulting women, Velayati said. However, parts of the Muslim world, he said, have witnessed heartening developments thanks to national resolve and the support of the resistance movement. SP/PA
