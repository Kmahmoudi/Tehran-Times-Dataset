TEHRAN- The 9th International Exhibition of Cement, Concrete, Manufacturing Technologies & Related Machineries of Iran (CEMENTEX 2017) is to be held at the Tehran Permanent International Fairgrounds from January 14 to 17, the public relations department of Trade Promotion Organization of Iran (TPO) announced on Sunday.  As reported, besides domestic companies, some foreign ones from France, Germany, Turkey, China, Finland, Sweden, South Korea, Japan, Armenia, and Turkmenistan will showcase their latest products in various fields including cement, concrete, raw materials, related machineries and services. Some related conferences will also be held during the four-day event. Iran is the fourth major producer of cement in the world and the first one among the Middle East countries.  Iran’s exports of cement and clinker in the past Iranian calendar year 1394 (ended on March 19, 2016) reportedly stood at more than 15 million tons, registering a 20 percent decrease compared to its preceding year due to insecure conditions of neighboring countries.  HJ/MA
