TEHRAN – The Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has praised a newly-published dictionary for the jurisprudence of the Holy Quran compiled in 33 volumes under the auspices of Ayatollah Mohammad Vaez-zadeh Khorasani. In a comment published by the Leader’s office on Thursday, he called the “Dictionary for the Jurisprudence of the Quran and the Secret of Its Eloquence”, and said, “I found the book better than all those books previously authored on this subject.”    “It is matchless; Sunni scholars, specially the Egyptians who have done a lot in this field, do not have any work that is comparable to this,” he added. The leader asked for copies of the dictionary to be sent to the library of Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. The book has been published in Arabic by the Islamic Research Foundation in Mashhad. Ayatollah Vaez-zadeh Khorasani died last December at the age of 91. He was a professor at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad and the founder of the Islamic Madhahib University, an educational center for Islamic denominations in Tehran that has branches in Zahedan, Sanandaj and Bandar Abbas.
