TEHRAN – Iran will be participating in the 25th Arabian Travel Market in Dubai, which opens its doors to the public today. During the three-day event, Iran’s pavilion will highlight tourism potential, traditions, handicrafts and rituals that are originated from the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan. “Taking part in the exhibit can have a huge impact on international marketing for the province,” CHTN quoted Alireza Jalalzaei, the provincial tourism chief, as saying on Tuesday. Worldwide tour operators will join the fair that will be held from April 22 to 25, the official added. Sistan-Baluchestan had long been shunned by potential foreign travelers though it is home to several distinctive archaeological sites and natural attractions, including two UNESCO World Heritage sites of Shahr-e-Soukhteh (Burnt City) and Lut Desert, shared with Kerman Province. The province also boasts arrays of mangrove forests which are repleted with diverse species of seabirds such as flamingos and herons. Over 39,000 travel professionals, government ministers and international press are expected to visit the business-to-business (B2B) exhibit that will showcase over 2,800 products and destinations, the organizers say.
