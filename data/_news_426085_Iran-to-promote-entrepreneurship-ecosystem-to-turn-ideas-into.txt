TEHRAN – Iran aims to create an entrepreneurship ecosystem, in which ideas will be turned into wealth, Iran’s vice president for science and technology Sourena Sattari said on Thursday, ISNA reported. He made the remarks during a meeting with expat experts at the Sharif University of Technology. In coming years, automobile manufacturing and steel industries would be replaced with industries created through entrepreneurship, he said. “To promote entrepreneurship ecosystem, we should forget about oil revenues, which leads to financial corruption and economy favoritism,” he added. Entrepreneurship promotes economic development in a society, Sattari announced. A government which, spends the investment of its nation never can promote economic development, he continued. “We never provide an atmosphere to develop influential human resources,” he lamented. Sattari said that the share of knowledge increased in Iran’s economy during recent years. “A young entrepreneur who begins his/her work in a little room, would replaces traditional system in national economy in near future,” he said. Nowadays the government should omit economy favoritism prevailing in different fields of health, education and defense, he said. “The government participation in different markets lead to the absence of competition in that field and promoting of economy favoritism, he lamented. Iranian startups has a great role in development of entrepreneurship ecosystem, he said. Sattari announced that Iran is mostly independent in the field of biotechnology industry and machinery. He said that the best startups in Iran are launched by expat experts, who localized world-renowned startups. “Human resources and an innovative person are the bases of knowledge-based economy,” he said.
