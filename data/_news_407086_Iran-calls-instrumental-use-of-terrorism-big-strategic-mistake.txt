TEHRAN – Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Jaberi Ansari said on Wednesday that an instrumental use of terrorists is harmful and a “big strategic mistake”.
 Jaberi Ansari made the remarks during a meeting with UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Sigrid Kaag in Tehran. Jaberi Ansari also said Iran’s principled policy is to support stability in Lebanon. Lebanon has been without a president since Michel Suleiman’s term expired in May 2014. According to the Constitution, the president of the country should represent the Maronite community. There are two main candidates for the post — former Lebanese Army Commander Michel Aoun and western-oriented politician Samir Geagea. Highlighting the importance of agreement among the various Lebanese political groups, he said it is essential that “foreign actors” support domestic consensus in Lebanon. Elsewhere, he condemned “sectarian approaches” in the region. “Adoption of sectarian policies will lead to ‘irreconcilable contradictions’ which means an undermining of the situations to end regional crises,” Jaberi Ansari said. He also said that political motivations are the root causes of the conflict in Syria and the resolution of this crisis entails “political dialogue” among warring sides. For his part, Kaag said that Syrian conflict should be resolved politically. She also expressed hope that stability in Lebanon would last through agreement among the rival Lebanese groups.
