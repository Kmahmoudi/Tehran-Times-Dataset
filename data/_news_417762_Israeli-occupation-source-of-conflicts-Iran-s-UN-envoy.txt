TEHRAN – Iran’s Ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshroo said on Wednesday that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories is the origin of all problems in the Middle East. “The injustice has been continuing for more than seven decades, exacerbated through Israeli expansionist and aggressive policies towards Palestinians and the whole region,” Khoshroo, told a UN Security Council debate. He noted that Tel Aviv have violated at least 86 UNSC resolutions. “These violations happen under the total impunity this regime is enjoying,” he added.
