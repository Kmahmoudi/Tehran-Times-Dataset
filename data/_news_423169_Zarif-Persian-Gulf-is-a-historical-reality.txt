TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad-Javad Zarif congratulated the National Persian Gulf Day on Monday to all those who have lived and coexisted alongside the gulf for thousands of years.
 “The Persian Gulf is not just a body of water; it is a historical reality that we know it under the name of the Persian Gulf for thousands of years,” Zarif said in a tweeter message, ISNA reported. “The Persian Gulf is the origin of indelible cultural and local values which have been integrated into the identity and life of our region,” he added.
