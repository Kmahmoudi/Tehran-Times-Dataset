TEHRAN – Two relics dating from Achaemenid-era (c. 550–330 BC) have recently been confiscated in Marvdasht, southern Fars province.  “The objects included an urn and a [massive] pedestal of a column which were seized from a home in Dorudzan region, in Marvdasht,” IRNA quoted Esmail Zera’atian, Fars province’s police chief, as saying on Thursday. The Achaemenid Empire was founded by Cyrus the Great. At its greatest extent from the Balkans to the Indus Valley, it was one of the largest empires in history, spanning 5.5 million square kilometers, and was larger than any previous empire in history.
