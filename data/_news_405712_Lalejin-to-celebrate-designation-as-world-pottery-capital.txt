TEHRAN – Laleljin will celebrate its registration as the world pottery capital tomorrow, a privilege given to the western Iranian city by jurors of the UNESCO-affiliated World Crafts Council. The event will be attended by a number of cultural officials including Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicraft Organization (CHTHO) Director Masud Soltanifar, as well as some enthusiasts for arts from the country and across the globe. Located in Hamedan Province, Lalejin is one of the most essential centers for production of the earthenware and ceramics in the country.
Earlier in July, Ghada Hijjawi-Qaddumi, the president of the World Crafts Council-Asia Pacific Region, announced that the city of Mashhad has been designated as the world’s city of gemstone.
Precious gemstones like agates and turquoise are found in Mashhad, which is also well-known for intricately designed silver jeweler studded with rubies and emeralds.
