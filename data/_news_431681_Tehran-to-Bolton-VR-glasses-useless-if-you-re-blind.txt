TEHRAN - Iran’s foreign minister has reacted to a picture showing U.S. national security advisor John Bolton wearing virtual reality goggles allegedly reconstructing the past on a tour in the Israeli-occupied city of Jerusalem al-Quds.

 On Sunday, Bolton and others were photographed wearing the device during a visit to the Jewish holy site of the Western Wall in East al-Quds, which Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. “It’s said a picture says a thousand words. This picture, however, says more than a thousand words about decades of failed US policies in our region,” Zarif tweeted late Monday. “In the valley of the blind, even those with VR glasses are still blind,” he added, apparently referring to Washington and Tel Aviv’s persisting ignorance of the region’s history and Palestinians’ historic demands. The U.S. recognized al-Quds as Israel’s “capital” in late 2017, and relocated its embassy from Tel Aviv to the city last May in direct violation of international law. The United Nations General Assembly voted soon after the recognition in favor of a resolution asking U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw the decision. Bolton’s visit further angered Palestinians as he allowed Israeli officials to accompany him on the tour. Since the international community does not recognize al-Quds as Israeli territory, foreign dignitaries would usually avoid having Israeli officials at their side while visiting the Western Wall. “Undermining international law by representatives of a superpower, will only lead to lawlessness, the logic of power rather than the power of logic. This behavior will not change the fact that East Jerusalem is occupied territory and the capital of the state of Palestine,” tweeted chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in reaction.
