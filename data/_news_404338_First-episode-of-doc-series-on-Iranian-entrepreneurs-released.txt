TEHRAN – The first episode of “Karestan”, a documentary series on Iranian entrepreneurs, was released on Saturday. Director Bahram Azimpur, project manager Rakhshan Bani-Etemad and producer Mojtaba Mirtahmasb attended a screening of the episode entitled “Cotton and Fire” at the Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA). The episode centers on Ali-Asghar Hajibaba, an entrepreneur active in the foundry and casting industry, to highlight new and creative ideas. “The idea to make a series about Iranian entrepreneurs goes back ten years. We wanted to make people, especially the youth, more acquainted with entrepreneurs. “I wanted the youth to know these individuals and today after screening this film, my wish has come true,” she added. “These types of projects need to be recognized by cultural policymakers and offered to an expert, but we ourselves had to recognize the need and pursue the projects and complete them,” she regretted.
 
Azimpur in his brief words said that talking about Hajibaba is as difficult as making a film about him, due to his varied economic activities. “When I first met him, I thought I might not be able to get enough close to him to make this doc, but we gradually learned many things from him.” Firuzeh Saber, the director of “The Entrepreneurship Development Foundation for Women and Youth”, which sponsors the event, also said that the project covers those entrepreneurs who have worked hard to stand on their own in order to portray the national development in the country. “Karestan” depicts the successful lives of Iranian entrepreneurs and gives a new definition of careers in Iran.   The project includes 17 independent films, each centering on the life of a successful entrepreneur who is active in the private sector, directed by different filmmakers under the supervision of Bani-Etemad and Mirtahmasb.
