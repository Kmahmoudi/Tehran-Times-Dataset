TEHRAN - State House Representative, Anna V. Eskamani, says that the recent elections in the U.S. were a referendum on President Trump. Democratic member for the Florida House of Representatives also says “President Trump's influence over elections is still present, and efforts to scare voters and divide us continues.” Following is the text of the interview: Q: Some argue that the congressional elections were a referendum on President Trump. What is your opinion? A: Yes, I agree that these past elections were a referendum on President Trump. However, I will add that President Trump's influence over elections is still present, and efforts to scare voters and divide us continues.  Q: Republicans still hold the majority in the Senate but Democrats succeeded to win the House after 7 years. Why led to the victory of Democrats in the House? A: Democratic candidates were inspirational and issue-based. We offered a vision for the future that focused on everyday Americans.  Q: Now, Democrats have the majority in the House. Can this impact Trump’s foreign policy, especially toward Iran? A: Absolutely, but I think it is more likely that divisions between the two chambers and two parties will continue, leading to not much change for the next two years.
