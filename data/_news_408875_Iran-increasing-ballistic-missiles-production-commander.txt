TEHRAN – The commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force said on Tuesday that Iran has increased production of ballistic missiles along with improving their precision and quality. Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh made the remarks while addressing Students Day at Imam Hossein University, Tasnim news agency reported. Boasting the country’s achievements in missile production, the commander said Iranian experts have used innovative methods to produce inexpensive missiles. Elsewhere in his remarks, he admired the Leader of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei for his wisdom that has pushed the country forward. “The only way out of oppression and conspiracy spearheaded by America is to follow the Supreme Leader’s orders and guidance,” Hajizadeh stated. The commander added, “Whenever the [Supreme Leader’s] orders were obeyed, we were able to overcome problems and sanctions.” Hajizadeh further noted that the Islamic Republic has overcome problems and become self-sufficient in defense industry. The comments came weeks after the Foreign Ministry said the Islamic Republic’s missile power is not open to any negotiations or compromise. “Iran’s missile tests are carried out within the framework of the country’s defense policies and Iran’s defense capabilities are not open to negotiation or compromise at all,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on November 14, according to Press TV. Iran has said on numerous occasions that its missile tests are not in violation of the UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that upheld a nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. Also, Iran’s defense minister said back in August that the Islamic Republic sees “no limit” for the range of the ballistic missiles that it is developing. "We don’t have any limits for the range of liquid or solid-fueled ballistic missiles," Dehqan said in a meeting in Isfahan, Fars reported.
