TEHRAN - Iranian Deputy Oil Minister for International Affairs and Trading Amir-Hossein Zamaninia said Iran will support extending the OPEC, non-OPEC deal to cut oil output beyond 2018, TASS reported. "Yes, we will support [it]," Zamaninia said at the Oil & Money conference on Tuesday, answering a question on the matter. The deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers including Russia to cut supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day runs until March 2018. The OPEC-led supply cut at present covers 24 countries. On the sidelines of the conference, Zamaninia also noted that Iran is interested in cooperation with consortiums of Russian, European and Asian companies in oil projects to ramp up the countryâ€™s oil production. "We want that Russian, European and Asian companies work in Iran in consortiums," the official said. According to the official, Russian oil companies are holding talks with European partners in this regard. He did not mention any further details. Six Russian oil companies, Rosneft, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil, Tatneft and Zarubezhneft, have signed memorandums on several oil producing projects with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC).
