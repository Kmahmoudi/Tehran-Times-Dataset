TEHRAN - Vice President Is’haq Jahangiri said on Saturday that all the decisions and actions should be based “wisdom” and “national interests” in the face of unfolding events in the region and beyond.
 “Events happening in West and changes in the U.S. government and some of the European countries caution the Iranian people of being careful about the decision-makings and entail any action to be based on wisdom and national interests,” he said during a speech at the 7th Summit of Iran’s Chamber of Guilds. He said that political and factional conflicts will be harmful to the Iranian people.  The vice president went on to say that Iran’s situation in the “volatile” Middle East region is “favorable”. Elsewhere, Jahangiri said that the Zionist regime of Israel and some of the “imprudent” regional countries seek to create conflict in Iran. For example, he said, “The British prime minister is invited to a Persian Gulf Arab littoral state to speak against Iran in a meeting. Such actions humiliate those countries.”  During the [Persian] Gulf Cooperation Council’s annual summit in the Bahraini capital Manama on Wednesday, May said she was “clear-eyed” about what she called “the threat” Iran poses to the region. May also stressed England would help the council “push back” against what she called Iran’s “aggressive regional actions.” NA/PA
