Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) suggested on Saturday that Vice President Pence is already planning his inauguration in anticipation of President Trump's impeachment. "Mike Pence is somewhere planning an inauguration. Priebus and Spicer will lead the transition," Waters wrote on Twitter, referring to former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, both of whom resigned their positions over the past week.  To be sure, impeachment proceedings against Trump are unlikely to advance in the near future. But Waters has been among the president's most vocal opponents in Congress and has repeatedly raised the notion of booting him from office. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) filed a resolution earlier this month accusing Trump of obstructing justice by firing FBI Director James Comey, who was at the time charged with leading the law enforcement investigation into possible collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. Sherman's resolution, co-sponsored by Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), marked the first impeachment article filed against Trump. But that effort drew little support from Democrats, let alone Republicans, making the process unlikely to advance soon.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
