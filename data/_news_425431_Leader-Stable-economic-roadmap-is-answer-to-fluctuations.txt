TEHRAN – The Leader of the Islamic Revolution on Sunday urged the administration to prepare a “stable economic roadmap” to stop fluctuations in the business market, saying in that situation “people and economic activists will know their duty and will hurry to help the government under a sense of stability and tranquility.”

 The suggestion by the Leader comes as the U.S. has exited the 2015 nuclear agreement and reintroduced sanctions against Iran. The first stage of sanctions are going to be implemented next month. Addressing President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet team, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “empowering the private sector” and “taking decisive action against wrongdoers (corrupt people)” are other remedies to the national economy. Since the U.S. announced restoration of sanctions against Iran, some opportunists have been misusing the situation to buy foreign currencies, especially dollar, and gold coin in large quantities, leading to the fall of national currency and a consequent inflation.    The Leader said those who have disrupted the foreign exchange and gold markets should be punished “at any rank” they might be.   Ayatollah Khamenei said the government should present a “capable”, “competent”, and “hardworking” image of itself because it would hearten the people.   Elsewhere in his remarks, the Leader said, “Showing power against foreigners, the Americans in particular, is a must.” The Leader praised the position of President Rouhani against threats of oil embargo against Iran by the U.S. while on a European tour, saying, “Showing power in the face of foreigners, especially Americans, is something essential.”   In the meantime, he stressed the need to boost diplomatic ties “with the East and West” except “in few cases such as America”. Regarding the JCPOA (the official name for nuclear deal), Ayatollah Khamenei said Europeans are still required to provide necessary assurances to save the agreement but the government “should not tie the country’s economy to that issue”. He also urged the government to increase its oversight on monetary transactions to prevent crimes such as money laundering. The Leader also advised the cabinet to be transparent and let the people know about the existing problems of the economy.
