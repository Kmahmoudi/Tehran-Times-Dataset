TEHRAN – Iran’s Industrial Development and Revolution Organization (IDRO) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with National Petrochemical Company (NPC) for supplying the equipment required in petrochemical industry’s downstream sector. The MOU was signed by NPC’s Managing Director Behzad Mohammadi and IDRO Head Baqer Ali on the sidelines of Iran Plast 2019 exhibition in Tehran on Wednesday, Shana reported. Speaking in the signing ceremony, Mohammadi pointed out that establishing a communication channel between petrochemical industry’s upstream producers and consumers of these products in the downstream sector was one of the main goals of Iran Plast exhibition.  Noting that about 6,000 firms are active in the downstream industries, he added: "These firms receive about 4 million tons of feedstock a year, and this has led to creating jobs for 4,000 people, indicating that in the petrochemical industry production and consumption are both of particular importance.” The official further stated that the MOU signed between the two entities is aimed to strengthen and support major downstream industries such as the automotive industry. “We need to be aware of the needs of the downstream industries and identify the polymer clusters that the industry needs and plan the petrochemical research and technology systems accordingly,” he said.
