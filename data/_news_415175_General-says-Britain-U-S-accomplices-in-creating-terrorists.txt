TEHRAN – Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri, the deputy chief of Iran’s armed forces, said on Monday that documents prove that the American and British governments were accomplices in creating terrorist groups in the Middle East, calling the U.S. the prime sponsor of terrorist groups. Jazayeri added, “All regimes which aided terrorists in Iraq and Syria are themselves gripped with problems that will have even more adverse consequences in the future.”  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
