TEHRAN – British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who arrived in Tehran from Muscat on Saturday, has described Iran as “a significant country”, to which his country attaches great importance. “Iran is a significant country in a strategically important, but volatile and unstable, region which matters to the UK's security and prosperity,” Johnson said ahead of his visit to Tehran, The Telegraph reported. “My first visit is an opportunity to hold further discussions on a series of crucial issues, including how we can find a political solution to the devastating conflict in Yemen and secure greater humanitarian access to ease the immense suffering there.” He also underlined the UK’s continued support for the Iran nuclear deal while making clear the British government’s concerns about “Iran’s activity in the region.” “While our relationship with Iran has improved significantly since 2011, it is not straightforward and on many issues we will not agree,” the chief diplomat said. Underlining the importance of dialogue as the key to resolve differences between the two countries, Johnson said he was looking forward to “a constructive visit”. He also voiced the British government’s concerns about “our dual national consular cases”, pointing to the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran since April 2016, as an important issue which he will try to resolve through dialogue.
