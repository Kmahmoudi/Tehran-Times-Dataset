The UN atomic watchdog hit back on Monday at U.S. criticism of the Iran nuclear deal, insisting its inspections there are the world's toughest and that Tehran is sticking to the accord.    
 "The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under [the 2015 deal] are being implemented," International Atomic Energy Agency head Yukiya Amano told reporters.     "The verification regime in Iran is the most robust regime … currently existing. We have increased the inspection days in Iran, we have increased inspector numbers ... and the number of images has increased," he said in Vienna.     "From a verification point of view, it is a clear and significant gain."     U.S. President Donald Trump has called the agreement between Iran and six major powers reducing its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief "the worst deal ever negotiated".
