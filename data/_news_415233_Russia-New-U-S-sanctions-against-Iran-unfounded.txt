TEHRAN - A senior Russian official has criticized fresh U.S. sanctions against Iran on "unfounded" grounds, saying they will only undermine the implementation of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran, Press TV reported.  Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's department for non-proliferation and arms control, told RIA Novosti news agency that the nuclear accord calls on “Iran to refrain from launching ballistic missiles, but … it is just an appeal, not an obligation.”  Earlier this week, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on 18 Iranian individuals, groups and networks.  PA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
