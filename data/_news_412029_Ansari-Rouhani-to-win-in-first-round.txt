TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani’s deputy for legal affairs has said Rouhani will be the winner of the upcoming presidential election in the very first round.

 Speaking to ISNA on Wednesday, Majid Ansari said his judgment was based on his “view of society”, adding Rouhani “will lead with good vote”. Nevertheless, he observed that “the slandering current has prepared a lot to deface Mr. Rouhani and his government.” Commenting on Rouhani’s record, he said the conclusion of the nuclear deal was even greater than the nationalization of oil.
