TEHRAN – Deputy Majlis Speaker Ali Motahari said on Sunday that part of lawmakers’ salary were donated to the people affected by the floods across the country. “A majority of the representatives allocated a few days’ worth of their income to the flood-stricken people,” Motahari said, Mehr reported. Following torrential rain in many regions across Iran since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year on March 21, catastrophic floods have hit 1,900 cities and villages in western, southwestern, northern and northeastern Iran, leaving 67 dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.
