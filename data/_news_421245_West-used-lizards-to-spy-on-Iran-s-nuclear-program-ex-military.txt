TEHRAN – Hassan Firouzabadi, the former chief of the Iranian armed forces, has said that Western countries had used lizards and chameleons to spy on Iran’s nuclear program. "Several years ago, some individuals came to Iran to collect aid for Palestine… We were suspicious of the route they chose. In their possessions were a variety of reptile desert species like lizards, chameleons… We found out that their skin attracts atomic waves and that they were nuclear spies who wanted to find out where inside the Islamic republic of Iran we have uranium mines and where we are engaged in atomic activities," Sputnik quoted him, citing ILNA.
