TEHRAN – A majority of hotels in seven provinces of Iran are set to give special discounts to their foreign and domestic customers on the occasion of Noruz - the Iranian new year - starting March 21. “Rate of the discounts will vary between 30 percent and 50 percent,” CHTN quoted Mohammad Mohebkhodaei, deputy director of the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, as saying on Tuesday. Initiated by the CHHTO and Iran Hotel Association, the scheme seeks to boost hospitality industry in provinces of Tehran, Hamedan, East Azarbaijan, Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari, Kohgiluyeh-Boyerahmad, Khorasan Razavi and Fars, the report said. Tehran and many other big cities are felt least crowded during the two-week Noruz vacations when choking air pollution and bustling streets become rare scenes. During that time most businesses and workplaces are closed, as are schools yet nearly all of its attractions and museums are open to the public. Millions of Iranians grasp the opportunity to travel mainly to the countryside. Their numbers are sometimes difficult to gauge accurately as many run their own cars to get around.
