TEHRAN - Kazem Jalali, chairman of the Parliament Research Center, said on Monday that the world should stand against U.S. for its violation of international law.
 Jalali made the remarks during a meeting with Japanese Ambassador to Tehran Mitsuo Saito. Jalali said the United States violated international law by withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal. The nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was turned into international law as the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution confirming it.   The MP said that the U.S. unilateralism in quitting the nuclear deal is harmful to the whole world. He also said, “I hope Iran-Japan economic relations would be expanded despite the U.S. unfair sanctions.”  President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. Saito said that in spite of the U.S. sanctions, Japan will continue buying Iran’s oil. Iran’s oil plays an important role in Japan’s long term plans, he noted. “We held difficult and complicated talks with the U.S. on buying Iran’s oil and a Japanese oil tanker berthed in Iran’s port on Sunday in order to buy oil,” Ambassador Saito said.
