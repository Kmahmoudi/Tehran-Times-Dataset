TEHRAN - President Rouhani sent separate messages to heads of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Armenia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, India and Uzbekistan and congratulated them on the advent of Nowruz. In the message that was sent on Monday, President Rouhani wrote: “Nowruz is the most beautiful celebration of nature that promises hope and verdure by turning winter into spring. This festival is the symbol of moderation, peace, warmness, light, abundance and liveliness that the Almighty grants the human kind; a moderation whose roots are in the changes in the nature, religious beliefs and merciful Islamic laws. He also described peace and unity as the demands of the moderate nations of the ancient region of Nowruz and said: “Today’s world needs hope more than ever, by which kindness, love and closeness has value and invites countries to interact rather than confront, because nations can rely on hope and peace to confront the misunderstandings of religion and tribal extremism which results in terrorism”. At the end of his message, Dr Rouhani wished a year full of happiness for the people of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Armenia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, India and Uzbekistan.
