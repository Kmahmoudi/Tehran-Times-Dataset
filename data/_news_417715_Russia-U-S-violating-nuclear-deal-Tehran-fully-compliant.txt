Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Tuesday that the United States has failed to comply with its obligations under the Iran nuclear deal, while Tehran has been “completely compliant”. Speaking to reporters, Ryabkov warned that Washington’s stance on the nuclear accord, which was signed by Iran and six world powers, may lead to its collapse. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has been committed to its obligations under the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) fully and in a most responsible manner, so far and hopefully in the future,” he said, according to RT. But the U.S. administration “violated not only the spirit, but also the letter” of the agreement, he said, cautioning that U.S. proposals on the deal “could de-facto paralyze the JCPOA or completely wipe it out in the worst case scenario.” The remarks came as a response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s castigatory speech on Friday, during which he decertified Iran’s compliance to the JCPOA, a move that threatens the fate of the internationally-endorsed agreement. “Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Trump said at the White House. Ryabkov said Russia is going to “explain again and again to our American colleagues [the] unacceptability and shallowness of the [U.S.] approach.” Tehran, too, has reacted to Trump’s anti-Iran rhetoric, saying the Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure. “Iran and the deal are stronger than ever... Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps will continue its fight against regional terrorists," President Hassan Rouhani said. On Wednesday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated the country’s commitment to the nuclear accord, saying Tehran will not be the first to violate the deal, but will “shred it to pieces” if the U.S. withdraws. It followed Trump’s remarks earlier this week, when he said terminating the deal was a “very real possibility” and that Iranian leaders had a “very modified” tone in their reaction to his speech. In recent months, European leaders have time after time voiced support for the deal.  The EU has announced that its foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, will be travelling to Washington in November to lobby for the preservation of the deal. However, whether the efforts bear fruit remains to be seen. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
