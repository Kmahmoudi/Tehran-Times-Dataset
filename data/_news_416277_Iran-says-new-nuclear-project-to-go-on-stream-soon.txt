TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Salehi, the director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, has said that a new nuclear project will be launched at Fordow nuclear plant in future days.
 “The project has to do with stable isotopes and research centers at Fordow, the preliminary stage of which will be launched in next two weeks and the main opening ceremony will be held on April 9, 2018,” he told IRIB in an exclusive interview published on Saturday. He also said that many changes have been made to the Fordow nuclear plant whose remarkable part is related to stable isotopes. Salehi said on Tuesday that Iran can resume uranium enrichment to the purity of 20 percent in five days in the Fordow plant if necessary. He said based on the nuclear deal many changes have been made to the Fordow plant, however, the changes are in a way that Iran can resume uranium enrichment to the level of 20 percent immediately. The remarks by Salehi came as U.S. President Donald Trump assigned, according to the Foreign Policy, a team of his close aides to assess Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal. Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia - finalized the text of the nuclear agreement on July 14, 2015. The deal went into effect on January 16, 2016. NA
