TEHRAN – A range of Iranian handicrafts will go on display during an exhibit, which will be held at the Central Bank of Iran from September 3 to 7, the Persian service of MNA reported on Tuesday. The event is slated to feature metalwork, potteries, ceramics, glasswork, jewelry, kilims (flat tapestry-woven carpets) as well as artworks of marquetry, enamel and turquoise, and inlay by 12 artists and artisans who are native to the provinces of Isfahan, East Azarbaijan, Alborz and Tehran. The exhibit is part of the scheme that the Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization initiated earlier in May to uphold artisans who are active in the sector by setting up temporary market stalls in some state-run institutes.
