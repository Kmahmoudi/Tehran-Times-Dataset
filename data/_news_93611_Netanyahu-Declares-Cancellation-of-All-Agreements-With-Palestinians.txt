After the Oslo Accords the Zionist regime and the Palestinian Authority signed several agreements including the Al-Khalil Accord. Zionist radio quoted Netanyahu as saying that in practice Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has canceled these agreements. Netanyahu also said if Palestinians continues attacking Israelis then their leader (Arafat) will be expelled from their territories and his regime ousted. "The right moment for his expulsion will be decided by a select group," added the hawkish Netanyahu, who plans to stand for the prime minister's post against the incumbent, and fellow Likud Party member Ariel Sharon. 
