TEHRAN – The lives of more than 5,000 prisoners on death row could be spared as a change in the law abolishes capital punishment for some drug-trafficking offences. In a communique by the Judiciary chief to all judicial officials on Tuesday, all judges who have sentenced drug-related offenders to capital punishment are required to stop the sentences and reexamine the cases. According to a judicial spokesman, the number of prisoners who might skip death penalty might be much higher than 5,000, as some 15,000 cases must be reexamined, Jame Jam reported on Wednesday. Majlis passed legislation in August raising the threshold for a death sentence to possession of 50kg of opium, 2kg of heroin or 3kg of methamphetamine. Under the previous law, possessing 5kg of opium or 30g of heroin was a capital offence.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
