TEHRAN – Tehran Friday prayer leader Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami has denounced Saad Hariri’s resignation as the Lebanese prime minister, censuring Saudi Arabia for “explicit intervention” in Lebanon’s internal affairs. Riyadh “summoned another country’s prime minister, detained him and told him to resign,” Khatami told worshippers on Friday, ISNA reported. He also said the text of Hariri’s resignation was written by Saudi officials, adding that the Saudis have always hated peace and stability in Lebanon and wanted chaos there.
