TEHRAN – Sistani House in southeast Iran has been fully restored to its former glory after a massive earthquake in 2003 razed the historic monument to the ground. The 18th-century building was renovated by German academics and restorers from Dresden University through a decade-long collaboration with their Iranian counterparts. Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization will reopen the mansion next month in a ceremony which is to be attended by German diplomats and experts, Mehr reported. A significant feature of the project is that it kept a balance between essential demands of a world cultural heritage site and modern retrofitting techniques which will protect it from future earthquakes. In December 2003, a 6.6-magnitude earthquake heavily damaged Sistani House and Arg-e Bam, which are parts of the UNESCO-registered Bam and its Cultural Landscape. Bam and its Cultural Landscape is located on the southern edge of the Iranian high plateau, in Kerman province. It’s highly regarded as an outstanding example of an ancient fortified settlement.
