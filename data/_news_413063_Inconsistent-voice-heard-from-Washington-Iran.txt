TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry said on Monday that Iran has not put talks with the U.S. on issues other than nuclear deal on agenda, noting “different” and “paradoxical” voices are being heard from Washington.
 “So far, we have not held negotiations with the U.S. on issues other than the JCPOA [the official name for the nuclear deal] and will continue this way,” Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said during a press conference. However he said, “During the former U.S. administration, some talks were held on the issue of some Iranian inmates in the U.S. due to humanitarian reasons which had positive results.”  Asked about the JCPOA Joint Commission meeting in Vienna on April 25, he said Iran complained about some violations of the deal, especially by the U.S. and some comments of the U.S. President Donald Trump that have obstructed the mechanism of banking relations. He said that the Joint Commission confirmed that Iran has fulfilled its obligations under the JCPOA and insisted on continued implementation of the deal. Qassemi also said, “Different voices are being heard from Washington and these voices are paradoxical; we should wait to judge.” In a statement on April 18 U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iran is “compliant with its commitments under nuclear deal. However, a day later he described the landmark nuclear deal as a failure. 
 
Iran and the 5+1 group (the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany) finalized the text of the JCPOA in Vienna in July 2015. It took effect in January 2016. According to the deal all nuclear related economic and financial sanctions against Iran must be terminated and Tehran must also slow down its nuclear activities.  Astana talks will not be canceled The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman also said that there are differences with the Turkish government on the Syrian conflict, however the Astana talks will not be canceled because of different views. “We make efforts that the Astana talks proceed firmly and be effective in settling the Syrian crisis,” Qassemi said. The next round of the Astana talks are to be held in the current month. The Astana talks were brokered by Iran, Russia and Turkey.  Iran and Russia have been backing the Syrian government while Turkey has been supporting the militants.
  Attack on Saudi embassy was ‘inconsiderate’ Qassemi also said the 2016 attack on Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Tehran was “inconsiderate” and its perpetrators will be punished. Riyadh cut diplomatic relations with Iran in January 2016 after angry protesters in Tehran attacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran in protest to the execution of a number of pro-democracy activists including prominent cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. Qassemi expressed hope that Saudi Arabia would pay more attention to regional realities. Iran not to let terrorists cause problems in borders He also said that Iran will pursue the issue of attack on Iranian soldiers by terrorists from neighboring Pakistan and will not let the terrorists cause problems for Iran in border areas. “The Pakistani officials have expressed regret over the issue, but it is not enough and steps are needed to be taken to establish security and stability in borders,” he said. On Thursday nine Iranian border guards were killed by terrorists in an ambush at the Pakistani border’s zero-point, near the Iranian town of Mirjaveh in the province of Sistan-Baluchestan. On the murder of an Iranian who owned satellite television network GEM TV in Istanbul, Qassemi said Iran has officially called on the Turkish government to pursue the case and announce the results. Saeed Karimian was shot dead in Istanbul on Saturday by unknown gunmen. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
