The ancient Roman       festivals of Saturnalia (god of agriculture, saturn) and Sol Invicta (sun god) are amongst the best known in the Western world. In most ancient cultures, including Persia, the start of the solar year       has been marked to celebrate the victory of light over darkness and the       renewal of the sun. For instance, Egyptians, four thousand years ago celebrated the rebirth of the sun at this time of the year. They set the       length of the festival at 12 days, to reflect the 12 divisions in their       sun calendar. They decorated with greenery, using palms with 12 shoots as       a symbol of the completed year, since a palm was thought to put forth a       shoot each month. The Persians adopted their annual renewal festival from the Babylonians       and incorporated it into the rituals of their own Zoroastrian religion. The last day of the Persian month Azar is the longest night of the year,       when the forces of Ahriman are assumed to be at the peak of their       strength. While the next day, the first day of the month "Day" known as "Khoram Rooz" or "Khore Rooz" (the day of sun) belongs to Ahura Mazda, the       Lord of Wisdom. Since the days are getting longer and the nights shorter,       this day marks the victory of Sun over the darkness. The occasion was celebrated in the festival of "Daygan" dedicated to Ahura Mazda, on the       first day of the month "Day". One of the themes of the festival was the temporary subversion of order. Masters and servants reversed roles. The king dressed in white would       change place with ordinary people. A mock king was crowned and masquerades       spilled into the streets. As the old year died, rules of ordinary living       were relaxed. This tradition persisted till Sassanian period, and is       mentioned by Biruni and others in their recordings of pre-Islamic rituals and festivals. Its' origin goes back to the Babylonian New Year       celebration. These people believed the first creation was order that came       out of chaos. To appreciate and celebrate the first creation they had a festival and all roles were reversed. Disorder and chaos ruled for a day       and eventually order was restored and succeeded at the end of the       festival. The Egyptian and Persian traditions merged in ancient Rome, in a festival       to the ancient god of seedtime, Saturn. The Romans exchanged gifts,       partied and decorated their homes with greenery. Following the Persian tradition, the usual order of the year was suspended. Grudges and quarrels       forgotten, wars would be interrupted or postponed. Businesses, courts and       schools were closed. Rich and poor became equal, masters served slaves, and children headed the family. Cross-dressing and masquerades, merriment       of all kinds prevailed. A mock king, the Lord of Misrule, was crowned. Candles and lamps chased away the spirits of darkness. It is not clear when and how the word "Yalda" entered the Persian       language. The massive persecution of the early Christians in Rome brought       many Christian refugees into the Sassanin Empire and it is very likely       that these Christians introduced and popularized "Yalda" in Iran. Gradually "Shab-e-Yalda" and "Shab-e-Cheleh" became synonymous and the two       are used interchangeably. Today "Shab e Cheleh" is merely a social occasion, when family and friends get together for fun and merriment. Different kinds of dried fruits, nuts, seeds and fresh winter fruits are       consumed. The presence of dried and fresh fruits is reminiscence of the       ancient feasts to celebrate and pray to the deities to ensure the       protection of the winter crops. The Iranian Jews, who are amongst the oldest inhabitants of the country,       in addition to "Shab-e-Cheleh" also celebrate the festival of "Illanout"       (tree festival) at around the same time. Their celebration of Illanout is       very similar to Shab-e-Cheleh celebration. Candles are lit; all varieties       of dried and fresh winter fruits will have to be present. Special meals       are prepared and prayers are performed. There are also very similar       festivals in many parts of Southern Russia that are identical to "Shab e       Cheleh" festival with local variations. Sweet breads are baked in shape of       humans and animals. Bon fires are made; dances are performed that resemble       crop harvesting. Comparison and detailed studies of all these celebrations       no doubt will shed more light on the forgotten aspects of this wonderful and ancient festival, where merriment was the main theme of the festival.
