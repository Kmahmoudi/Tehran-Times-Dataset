The agreements call for the “construction of four energy blocks at the atomic plant at Kudankulam” and nuclear power plants at new sites in India. The two also signed agreements on navigation, customs services and excise. “Russia and India consider that atomic energy will guarantee a vital source of energy for future generations,” said a statement released in New Delhi yesterday. Putin, on his fourth trip to India as president, wants a six-fold increase in trade to help restore a relationship that has cooled since the Soviet Union collapsed. “The volume of trade turnover isn’t bad, but it’s absolutely inadequate for Russia and India, $3bn in total,” Putin said before leaving for New Delhi. “By 2010 we could move to a turnover of $10bn and double that by 2015.” Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said trade and energy security were key elements of India’s ties with Russia. The two countries would also seek to expand defense ties. “Russia remains indispensable to India’s foreign-policy interest.” Putin said Russia would promote peaceful nuclear cooperation with India.
