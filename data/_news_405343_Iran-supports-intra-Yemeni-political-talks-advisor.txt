TEHRAN - Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, on Monday reiterated Tehran’s position that Iran supports political talks among the Yemeni opposition groups without any foreign interference.
 “Problems in Yemen can simply be resolved politically,” Amir-Abdollahian said during a meeting with a visiting Yemeni political delegation. Amir-Abdollahian also condemned Saudi Arabia’s war on Yemen, praising the Yemeni people’s resistance against the Saudi aggression which started in March 2015. “The Yemeni nation have defended their independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity in military, economic and diplomatic areas,” he explained. In the newest Saudi-led airstrikes on Yemen at least 10 children have been killed and 28 others injured, Sky News reported on Sunday. 
A spokesman for the Paris-based Medecins Sans Frontieres said the airstrike hit a school in the northwestern town of Haydan in Saada province.
"We received 10 dead children and 28 wounded, all under the age of 15, who are victims of airstrikes," the aid agency spokesman Malak Shaher said.
Amir-Abdollahian advised Saudi Arabia to stop its war on Yemen. He also congratulated Yemenis for holding the first session of their parliament. “Parliaments are symbol of democracy in countries and holding the Yemeni parliament session sent the world this clear message that the political leaders and the Yemenis guard their territorial integrity and national unity,” he explained. Holding the first session of the parliament can help expand relations of the country with the world, he said. Amir-Abdollahian added that Iran’s parliament welcomes expansion of ties with the Yemeni parliament. Head of the Yemeni delegation slammed economic blockade of their country and inhuman actions being taken against the Yemeni people, especially women and the children. He also called for expansion of parliamentary ties between Iran and Yemen. Yemen’s parliament held on Saturday its first session since the outbreak of conflict in the Arab country almost two years ago. NA/PA
