TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has said that the Islamic Republic welcomes any mediation by regional countries to mend the frosty ties between Tehran and Riyadh. However, he said, Iran has so far not seen a clear signal by Saudi Arabia. “Iran has seen no clear sign from Saudi Arabia to improve relations between the two countries,” Qassemi said in an interview with Al Jazeera. “The Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes any mediation between the countries of the region such as Saudi Arabia,” he remarked. It came after Iraqi satellite channel Alghadeer reported that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, had asked Haider al-Abadi to lead the mediation with Iran. “During our visit to Saudi Arabia, they also asked us to do so, and we said that to [the] Iranian side. The Iranian side looked at this request positively,” Alghadeer quoted Iraqi Interior Minister Qasim al-Araji as saying by on Sunday. Araji also said that the improvement of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia would have a positive impact on the region. Qassemi noted that the mediation of the Iraqi Interior Minister between Tehran and Riyadh is a positive action if it can establish the security and stability in the region. He also expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia would end the war in Yemen. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
