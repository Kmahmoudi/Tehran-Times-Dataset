TEHRAN — Barekat charity foundation has completed afforestation programs on the outskirt of Tehran province which will be implemented as of today, IRIB reported. Following the supreme leader’s decree on protecting the environment and preserving vegetation, the charity foundation has carried out afforestation programs on 1,000 hectares of land in southeastern, southwestern and northern districts of the province. Saltbush, haloxylon, pine, cypress, mulberry, celtis australis, olive tree, barberry, Russian olive, etc. are of the trees planted in the area. Regarding persistent air pollution, dust particles, and desert spread posing problems for Tehraners such afforestation programs would help in enhancing air quality in the city.
