TEHRAN- Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has once more denied claims by Western nations that Iran has provided Russia with drones for use in the Ukraine conflict, highlighting that Tehran has invariably decried violence and conflict all over the world. The comments were made by Amir Abdollahian to his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba during a phone conversation on Friday. According to a readout of the conversation released by the Iranian foreign ministry, Amir Abdollahian declared, "The Islamic Republic of Iran has undergone an eight-year imposed war and is consequently opposed to conflicts in Ukraine, Yemen, etc." He added, “We have good relations with Russia and have had defense cooperation in the past, but our policy toward the war in Ukraine is to respect the territorial integrity of both countries, not to send weapons to the warring parties.”  The foreign minister went on to say that the Islamic Republic's opposition to war serves as the cornerstone for Tehran’s clear and unambiguous foreign policy. Russia and Iran have both vehemently refuted allegations that Tehran sent Moscow drones for use in the conflict in Ukraine. In July, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made the first anti-Iran allegations, claiming that Washington had "information" indicating that the Islamic Republic was getting ready to give Russia "up to several hundred drones, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline" for use in the conflict. The Iranian foreign minister stated last week that his country was poised to examine the claims by the West over the selling of drones to Russia in a joint meeting with Ukrainian experts. Amir Abdollahian echoed those statements on Friday, assuring his Ukrainian counterpart that Tehran is prepared to have technical talks with Ukraine in the presence of military specialists from the two countries without the need for any third party. “I believe that Ukraine should be careful not to be influenced by some extremist European politicians,” Iran’s chief diplomat pointed out. He also renewed readiness by Iran to assist Ukraine and Russia to agree on a truce. Kuleba, for his part, praised Iran's stance on not delivering arms to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. He emphasized the significance of negotiations between the two nations' technical and military representatives. He also said that Kiev does not act on the advice of other parties.
