TEHRAN – A senior political analyst believes the “pro-Trump enthusiasts” in Iran are mistaken to disregard the strong possibility of the U.S. president’s impeachment, while Trump is facing serious problems within America. Some in Iran “do not regard as serious the U.S. president’s move toward internal clashes with rivals and even some Republicans, and citing Trump’s economic record, they already consider him the winner of 2020 elections,” Davoud Hermidas-Bavand, professor of political science and international law, said in an article published in the Shargh newspaper on Sunday. But the point is that Trump himself has referred to his impeachment as a move against America’s economic interests and a blockage of his projects, which is likely to happen given that the Democrats won the U.S. House of Representatives in the November elections, Hermidas-Bavand remarked. Pointing to the investigations surrounding the U.S. president, the analyst said, “In the past, similar corruption cases involving U.S. officials have had serious consequences for them.” “If the trend of disclosures about Trump continues and his ties with Russia during the [2016] elections are proven, without a doubt Trump’s impeachment will be set in motion,” he argued.  According to CNN, Trump’s campaign, transition, inaugural committee and presidency are now under active criminal investigation. His business – the Trump Organization – and his defunct charity – The Trump Foundation are also under investigation. His college – Trump University – has already been deemed a fraud.
