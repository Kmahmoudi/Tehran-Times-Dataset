Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization sees a bright future for Hamedan province that attracted a substantial number of visitors in the first four months of the current Iranian calendar year (started on March 21). Over two million travelers, including some 4,300 foreigners, visited Hamedan during the period, according to Ali Khaksar, a provincial tourism official, ISNA reported. Thanks to abundant cultural, historical and natural sites, mountainous weather, tourism infrastructure development and a new advertising campaign, the west central province is becoming more popular. Its capital of the same name is currently taken on appearance of the “capital of Asian tourism in 2018”, a privilege which was approved in the second ACD Tourism Ministers Meeting held in Cambodia, June 2017. Hamedan will also be hosting an ACD conference titled “ACD Tourism Capital, 2018” from August 27 to 29.  Known in classical times as Ecbatana, Hamadan was one of the ancient world’s greatest cities. Pitifully little remains from antiquity, but significant parts of the city center are given over to excavations. Ecbatana was the capital of Media and subsequently a summer residence of the Achaemenian kings who ruled Persia from 553 to 330 BC. Sitting on a high plain, Hamedan is graciously cool in August but snow prone and freezing from December to March. In summer the air is often hazy. Ali Sadr cave, Ganjnameh inscriptions, Avicenna mausoleum, Hegmataneh hill, Alaviyan dome, Jameh mosque, and St. Stephanos Gregorian Church are amongst Hamedan’s attractions to name a few. The CHHTO announced in May that “Iran plans to construct 2,000 new eco-lodges… over half of which to be inaugurated by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019) and the rest will come on stream by 2021.” PHOTO: Travelers visit the popular mausoleum of Avicenna in Hamedan, west central Iran.
