TEHRAN – Iran’s top diplomat held a phone conversation with his Mauritanian counterpart on the situation in Palestine in light of Israel’s recent aggression against Gaza and Lebanon. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian and his Mauritanian counterpart Mohamed Salem Ould Merzoug has in a phone conversation congratulated each other on the holy month of Ramadan and discussed bilateral ties and regional developments, particularly the situation in Palestine, according to the Iranian foreign ministry. Amir Abdollahian congratulated the top Mauritanian diplomat on the successful holding of the meeting of the OIC’s foreign ministers in Nouakchott and invited him to visit Tehran, which was welcomed by the top Mauritanian diplomat. The two foreign ministers held talks over the current situation in Palestine and the recent acts of aggression by the Zionists as well as their desecration of the al-Aqsa Mosque and raid on Palestinian worshippers. Amir Abdollahian and Merzoug underlined the need for a united action by Islamic countries in order to counter the Zionist regime’s aggression. Given that Mauritania holds the presidency of the OIC, pushing for an emergency meeting of the organization was another issue the Iranian and Mauritanian foreign ministers discussed. The Iranian foreign minister last week met with Mauritania’s Minister of Islamic Affairs Dah Ould Sidi Ould Amar Taleb in Tehran. The foreign minister hailed the African country’s government and people for their support of the Palestinian cause. Mauritania’s Minister of Islamic Affairs Dah Ould Sidi Ould Amar Taleb for his part gave warm greetings to the Iranian president and people on behalf of his country’s high-ranking officials. Mauritania’s minister of Islamic affairs also praised Iran’s support for the Palestinian people and said the Palestinian issue is not exclusively about the people of Palestine, but it’s related to the entire Muslim ummah, and Iran has been a pioneer in this regard. 303 All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
