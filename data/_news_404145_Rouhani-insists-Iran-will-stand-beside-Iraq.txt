He praised efforts being made by the Iraqi religious scholars in strengthening unity among the Iraqis and serving their “national interests”. Pointing to the need to expand relations between Iran and Iraq, he said, “Expanding, boosting and strengthening Tehran-Baghdad relations will benefit the people in the two countries and in the region [the Middle East region].” For his part, Hakim elaborated on the latest developments in Iraq, saying the liberation of Fallujah was a result of “unity” and “coordination” among the Iraqi political and military forces. On June 17, the Iraqi forces recaptured Fallujah from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.  The city was occupied by the terrorists in January 2014. On Sunday the Iraqi political figure also met separately with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's National Security Council.
