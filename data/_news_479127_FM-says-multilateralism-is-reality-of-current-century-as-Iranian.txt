TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian on Sunday praised the Iranian parliament’s overwhelming vote to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, saying this shows the “strong will and seriousness” of Iran to develop regional and international cooperation and also reinforces Tehran’s “look to the East” approach. He added, “Multilateral approach is the reality of the current century.” Iranian lawmakers passed on Sunday a bill allowing Iran to become a full member of the SCO. A majority of lawmakers -203 - voted yes to the bill while only three voted no. Four lawmakers abstained. The passed bill allows the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to sign and accept dozens of SCO agreements and documents.
