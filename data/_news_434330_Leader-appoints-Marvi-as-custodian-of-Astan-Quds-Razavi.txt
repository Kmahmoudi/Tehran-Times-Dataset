The Leader offered the new custodian a list of guidelines for the post. “Firstly, I see it fit to remind you of all the points mentioned in the decree appointing Mr. Raeisi, including seizing this opportunity to serve and use all that is in your power for this purpose to serve the pilgrims and the residents of the city, particularly the weak and the needy; exploit the cultural capacities of the Astan Quds; preserve and protect the unique architectural, calligraphic, and decorative art collection in the entirety of the buildings and spaces; protect the abundant and rich donations; manage economic and service organizations; and finally benefit from the spirituality of this shining sun, with purity and hard work,” the Leader said in the decree published by the khamenei.ir. He added, “Secondly, I strongly recommend collaboration with the Hawzah (Seminary) and the clergy of the holy city of Mashhad. Thirdly, cooperating with government officials and assisting them accordingly is also recommended. Finally, seeking devoted and revolutionary experts and employing them in different positions is another key recommendation that has always been insisted upon.” Marvi was in charge of a department at the Leader’s Office responsible for contacts and communications with seminaries before being appointed to the new post.
