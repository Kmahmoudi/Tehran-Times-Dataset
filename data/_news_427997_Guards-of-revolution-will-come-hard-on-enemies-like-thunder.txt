TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) chief Mohammad Ali Jafari issued a statement on Saturday warning that the “guards of the revolution” are determined to come on enemies like a “destructive thunder” to take revenge of the organizers of the September 22 terrorist attack in Ahvaz.
 “The enemies and their wicked allies should know that the guards of the revolution will never forget blood of the martyrs and are determined to come on them like a destructive thunder,” General Jafari said. He added, “Undoubtedly, blood of those who were martyred in this brutal and wicked attack will make us more determined to protect our causes, counter plots of the hegemony and annihilate anti-revolutionary forces.” On September 22, five gunmen attacked a military parade in the southwestern city of Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan province, killing 24 people and wounding 69 others. A four-year-old child was among the killed. Iran holds Saudi Arabia and the UAE responsible for the attack. In May 2017, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) said his country would bring insecurity into Iran. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have refused to condemn terrorist attack in Ahvaz.  Hossein Salami, Jafari’s deputy, on Friday called on Saudi Arabia and the UAE to respect Iran’s “red lines” or face retaliation. “You are sitting in a glass house and cannot tolerate the revenge of the Iranian nation,” Salami said. The attack in Ahvaz took place as Iran was marking Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Iran on September 22, 1980.  The Intelligence Ministry released a report on September 24 announcing that 22 people have been arrested in connection with the attack. The ministry said “weapons, exclusive material and communication equipment were seized” from the people involved in the attack.
