TEHRAN- The engineering principles were used for the very first time in designing a device for Iranian traditional medicine.  The device helps traditional medicine experts to identify mechanical characterizations of soft tissue in order to diagnose and treat a variety of diseases, ISNA reported on Saturday.   Soft tissue, also known as Adipose tissue, or fat, is an anatomical term for loose connective tissue composed of adipocytes. Its main role is to store energy in the form of fat, although it also cushions and insulates the body. The new device was designed by cooperation between Dr. Behzad seyfi and Dr. Nasser Fatouraee from Amirkabir University of Technology and Dr. Mehdi Alizadeh from Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Dr. Behzad Seyfi explained that according to Iranian traditional medicine, the mechanical characteristics of Adipose tissue especially in some body parts where it affects Extracellular fluid (ECF) can determine the quality of health or the existence of some disease; however, currently, most traditional medicine practitioners use their hands to examine such characteristics.  “Obviously, examination of such characteristics with hands is not precise enough, but the new device will generate some accurate, measurable data,” he said.  According to Seyfi, the data provided by the device can also be used in manufacturing of prosthesis and artificial organs.  “The production process includes both hardware and software designs. In terms of hardware manufacturing, two samples of the device were produced for running laboratory and clinical tests and a permit was issued for registering them as patents. Furthermore, eight editions of the device were manufactured for running tests on animal samples,” Seyfi further explained.  He added that the required software has also been developed and 50 healthy people were examined for symptoms.  Finally, he said, the device must be tested on more people and at least 20 editions of it must be produced before it can get into the market.  According to Seyfi, the new method would cut the treatment expenses, it is also a totally non-invasive technique and doesn’t have any side effects.  SJ/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
