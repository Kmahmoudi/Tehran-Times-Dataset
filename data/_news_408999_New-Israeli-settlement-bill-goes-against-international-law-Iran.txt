TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry condemned on Friday a new bill proposed by Israeli lawmakers that would legalize some 4,000 settler homes in the occupied West Bank, saying the measure is against “international law”.
 Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said the bill “runs contrary to international law and regulations especially the international human rights and international humanitarian law, and those who take such actions violate the international rights and should be prosecuted.”  The move violates the Palestinians’ right to determine their destiny, the Foreign Ministry official added. Qassemi urged the international bodies to make Israel obey the international law. Israeli lawmakers voted on Wednesday to advance the bill, which would retroactively legalize settler homes built on private Palestinian land, Guardian reported. UN high commissioner for human rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein strongly criticized the settlement bill. “Israel as the occupying power, must respect the private property of Palestinians, regardless of whether or not compensation is provided,” Guardian quoted him as saying in a statement. He also said, “All Israeli settlements – whether outposts built without formal approval but often with the support of the Israeli authorities and which are currently illegal under Israeli law, or settlements approved by Israel – are clearly and unequivocally illegal under international law and constitute one of the main obstacles to peace.”  All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law.
