TEHRAN - OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo has stressed the important role of Iran as one the founders of OPEC saying that Iran will always be a frontier in the future of the organization. In an interview with Shana, Barkindo noted that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will always remain the same and no other interpretation of OPEC is legitimate. “Having a vision beyond the market’s short-term outlook is crucial for our organization.

Asked about the recent criticisms regarding OPEC’s weak performance in balancing the oil market and the $20 fall in oil prices, the official noted that the unexpected increase in the production levels of some non-OPEC nations took not only OPEC but also all energy institutions by surprise and was one of the reasons for the fall in oil prices. “This is an indication that in oil markets long history, always new factors and unexpected developments emerge.” he said. Regarding the organization’s future plans for following the OPEC, non-OPEC cuts, Barkindo said OPEC+ deal is a subject which should be constantly considered and discussed and all involving parties have a say in this deal. “Our future plans will definitely be made considering all OPEC and non-OPEC members.” he added.
