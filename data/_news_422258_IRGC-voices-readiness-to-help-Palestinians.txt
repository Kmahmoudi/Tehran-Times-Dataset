TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) issued a statement on Saturday voicing its readiness to provide whatever support is necessary to the Palestinian people in the face of the Israeli regime’s ongoing crimes in the occupied territories. Strongly condemning the Israeli crimes against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the IRGC said, “The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, as the Iranian nation’s powerful arm, will spare no effort to help the Muslim people of Palestine.” It also emphasized that the recent Tel Aviv regime’s brutal crimes against the Palestinians in the enclave showed that despite constant support of the U.S., all efforts by some reactionary Arab countries would fail and only boost the Palestinians’ resistance.
