TEHRAN- Spokesman for Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee has stressed that the release of the American prisoner was a humanitarian gesture, however Washington is unwilling to resolve the remaining issues in the nuclear talks.  In a news conference, Abolfazl Amouei stated that the Islamic Republic of Iran views the release of prisoners as a humanitarian issue apart from Iran's nuclear negotiations. He said that certain regional nations on the southern Persian Gulf coasts had acted as middlemen to facilitate the release of the American prisoner, adding that Iranian people who had also been wrongfully detained there had also been let free. The parliamentary committee spokesman also said the UN and friendly countries must step in to support Iran's lawful demand for the release of some of its financial assets that have been frozen by unfairly imposed unilateral U.S. sanctions. When asked if the release of some of Iran's frozen assets and the release of American detainees were related to the JCPOA, Amouei responded, “Those are two separate issues. Because the negotiations with the 4+1 countries have proceeded satisfactorily and only a few issues still remain unsolved.” He said that although Iran has provided technical and logical viewpoints on the remaining issues, it appears that the other side (the U.S.) is not prepared or willing to address them because of its internal circumstances and the impending U.S. Congress elections.
