TEHRAN – U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision will be short-living, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman told the Jame-e Jam newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday.

 Pointing to Trump’s travel ban, Bahram Qassemi said, “It seems Trump will not be able to go on with such decisions for long. Things are liable to change.” As for Iran’s reaction to the ban, he said, “Since things do not seem much stable, it is not likely to be able to state and adopt a long-lasting policy.” SP/PA
