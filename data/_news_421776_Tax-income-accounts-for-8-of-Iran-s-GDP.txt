TEHRAN- The share of tax revenues in Iran’s gross domestic product (GDP) has reached eight percent, according to Head of National Tax Administration Kamel Taqavinejad. The official said the figure should reach 11 percent by the end of the country’s Six Five-Year National Development Plan (March 2021), IRNA reported on Sunday. President Hassan Rouhani’s economic strategy is to significantly reduce the government’s dependency on oil and instead collect tax more systematically.
