TEHRAN – A professor of political science says Iran is an important country in the Silk Road project as China and Iran have already established “extensive” relationship. “Iran is, of course, a major country in this project, and China already has extensive relations with Iran,” Nader Entessar from South Alabama University tells the Tehran Times.  Under the project - also called One Belt, One Road - China aims to invest in infrastructure projects including railways and power grids in Central, West and Southern Asia, as well as Africa and Europe. Following is the text of the interview with Entessar:      Q: Why is China is trying to revive the ancient Silk Road? A: China has been interested in reviving the Silk Road project for many years. China sees the countries of the old Silk Road as important economic markets for its goods and services.  Also, as Beijing increases its political muscle, it may be interested in enhancing its strategic presence in the countries of the old Silk Road. “For Iran to play a pivotal role, it must enhance its own presence in the countries of the Silk Road, including those in South and Central Asia,” South Alabama University academic says.Q: What can be the importance of Iran in this project? A: Iran is, of course, a major country in this project, and China already has extensive relations with Iran.  But for Iran to play a pivotal role, it must enhance its own presence in the countries of the Silk Road, including those in South and Central Asia, and play a bigger economic role there than it plays now. Q: How does the European Union look at the project? Can it be considered as a threat to the EU itself? A: The European Union has had an ambivalent feeling towards the Silk Road project.  I don't think the EU views it as a major threat to its own interests per se.  But the EU and China are economic competitors globally, and obviously they try to maximize their own gains and minimize their losses anytime they compete for greater access to a particular market. Q: Can the Silk Road lead to an improvement in relations between Iran and the EU? A: Not necessarily.  The EU and Iran have a number of other areas for cooperation and contestation.
