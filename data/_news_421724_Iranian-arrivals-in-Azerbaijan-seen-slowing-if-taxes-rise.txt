TEHRAN – Iranian tourist arrivals in Azerbaijan is expected to face a slower pace this year if Iran levies sharp departure taxes. The number of tourists coming to Azerbaijan from Iran is growing every year, but unlike previous years, no growth is expected this year due to possible increase in taxes, Trend quoted Chairman of the Azerbaijan Tourism Association Nahid Bagirov as saying on Friday. Bagirov added that according to the information gathered from Iranian travel companies, the taxes will rise from March 20. “If this decision comes into force, there may be some problems with the arrival of tourists from Iran to Azerbaijan. Therefore, no increase is expected in the number of tourists from Iran this year,” Bagirov said. Based on previous reports, the departure tax has been proposed to reach 2.2 million rials (about $52) from the current 750,000 rials (about $17), yet the fee will jump for those who would make their second or third trips over a one-year period. Around 320,000 Iranians toured Azerbaijan in the first 10 months of 2017, an increase of 64 percent year on year, IRNA reported. Russian, Georgian, Iranian and Turkish tourists accounted for the highest number of visits to the country.
