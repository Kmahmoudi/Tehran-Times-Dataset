TEHRAN- In a meeting with Iranian Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Masoud Karbasian in Tehran on Monday, Italian Ambassador to Iran Mauro Conciatori announced his country’s deep commitment to Iran’s nuclear deal and said Italy tries to continue its economic and trade ties with Iran as before. He said positive political and economic signs are being observed from the global society for supporting Iran’s deal specially from the signatories of the deal. In the meeting, Karbasian and Conciatori explored the ways for preserving and expanding economic ties between Iran and Italy and also between Iran and European Union under the condition of U.S. withdrawal from Iran’s nuclear deal (known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA). Also in a meeting with Farhad Yazdandoust, the advisor to Iranian energy minister in international affairs, last week, Conciatori had said that seven Italian large companies active in the field of renewable energies will visit Tehran next month to attend a conference with Iran’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (known as SATBA) for exploring ways of mutual cooperation.
