TEHRAN – A top foreign policy adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution has laid out ways to respond to U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, also called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Fars reported. In a meeting dubbed “Lasting Experience”, aimed at reviewing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s stances on the JCPOA, Ali Akbar Velayati stressed the importance of boosting Iran’s nuclear power and countering Washington’s anti-Iran stance through some measures. “We can launch UF6 which turns into gas at 70 degrees [Celsius] and has the ability to spin centrifuges for enrichment,” Velayati said. He further said Iran should produce and use powerful nuclear engines for ships and submarines. “One of the qualities of such engines is that a submarine with such engine can stay under water for two years,” he said, lauding President Rouhani for his order on production of nuclear engines. The senior advisor said while his suggestions are appropriate responses to the U.S., they are not inconsistent with Iran’s commitments under the JCPOA. He added that Iran can also produce stable isotopes and this shows the country’s power. Velayati also said the country can use carbon fiber in its nuclear industry.  “If we want to use IR6 and IR8 [centrifuges], it won’t be possible using ordinary metals, and we must use carbon fiber which has good industrial usages,” he explained. Pointing to the failed policy of shifting toward the West, he said Russia and China have proven that they are much better partners for Iran than any Western country. “Every country acts according to its national interests, but the national interests of us is consistent with those of Russia and China in various fields,” the former foreign minister added.
