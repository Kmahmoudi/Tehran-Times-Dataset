TEHRAN – The Prime Minister of Iraqi Kurdistan, Nechirvan Barzani, said on Sunday that Iran can “play a positive role” in resolving disputes between the Iraqi government and the autonomous Kurdish Regional Government (KRG). In a meeting with the Iranian Ambassador to Baghdad, Iraj Masjedi, Barzani said serious dialogue is needed to resolve the disputes, adding that Iran can help in this regard. Masjedi, for his part, said Tehran has already offered to mediate between Baghdad and Erbil and tried to pave the ground for talks between the two sides.
