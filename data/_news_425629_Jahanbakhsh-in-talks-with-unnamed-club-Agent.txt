TEHRAN - The agent of reported Leicester City target Alrieza Jahanbakhsh has confirmed transfer talks with an unnamed club, sparking speculation over the Iranian winger’s potential destination. Amir Hashemi, representative of AZ Alkmaar winger Jahanbakhsh, told Dutch media on Friday afternoon: “We are actually discussing a transfer, but I cannot say which team is involved, but it is not a Dutch club.” City and Premier League rivals Brighton have both been linked with the Iranian international, who last night posted a picture of himself on an Austrian Airlines flight, leicestermercury.co.uk reported.   That sparked further talk that a move was imminent, although Dutch outlet NH report that Jahanbakhsh is due to return to AZ for pre-season on Saturday. The Brighton Argus have confirmed the Seagulls’ interest in the 24-year-old with their sources suggesting a move to the south coast is on the cards. Despite playing out wide, Jahanbakhsh was top scorer in the Eredivisie last season, scoring 21 goals. Jahanbakhsh’s value has soared in his two seasons at AZ. He has been linked with a move to Napoli and West Ham United. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
