TEHRAN – A top spokesman of the Iranian Armed forces has strongly dismissed calls for negotiations on the country’s missile program, saying Iran has the right to be capable of defending itself against enemies. “We advise those who speak about the Islamic Republic of Iran to avoid [speaking about] defense and missile fields,” Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said on Saturday, IRIB news reported. The comments were made after a number of political commentators and news outlets in Iran urged authorities to resolve the missile issue through dialogue. Iran has repeatedly rejected calls on its missile program. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
