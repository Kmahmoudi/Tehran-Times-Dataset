Boeing announced on Tuesday that the company will look to the Office of Foreign Assets Control for approval to perform under this transaction. Earlier in December 2016, the Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran Air) signed a $16.6 billion deal to buy 80 passenger planes from Boeing. The deal included the purchase of 50 narrow-bodied 737 planes and 30 long-range 777s which are due to be delivered in a 10-year period starting from 2018. Iran Air-Boeing agreement was the first of its kind since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and came after most international sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of its nuclear deal with world powers.
