TEHRAN â€“ Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh will leave Tehran for Vienna Tuesday evening to attend the 171st meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) which is due to be held on Wednesday, Shana reported on Monday. This meeting is a sequel to a September meeting in which OPEC agreed to reduce production to between 32.5 million and 33.0 million barrels per day - an effort to prop up prices - from the organization's latest production estimates of 33.64 million bpd.
