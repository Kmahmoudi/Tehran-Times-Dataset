TEHRAN - Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Monday deplored a ruling by a Bahraini court which has dissolved Al-Wefaq National Islamic Society, the main opposition bloc in the country, saying such unconstructive measures will only add complexity to the already tumultuous situation in the tiny Arab caliphate.  
  “Such measures (dissolution of opposition group) by the Bahraini government indicate that they (Manama rulers) are not after settling the existing dilemmas and problems, and such conducts will further complicate the situation,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday.
