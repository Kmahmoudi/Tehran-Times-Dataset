TEHRAN – A senior European Union diplomat says European states will do their best to sustain a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, amid stepped-up U.S. opposition to the multilateral accord. Helga Schmid, the secretary general of the European External Action Service, made the remark in an address to the 4th Europe-Iran Forum in the Swiss city of Zurich on Wednesday. “This is not a bilateral agreement, it’s a multilateral agreement. As Europeans, we will do everything to make sure it stays,” Schmid said. SP/ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
