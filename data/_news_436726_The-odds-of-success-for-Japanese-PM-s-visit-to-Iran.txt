TEHRAN – U.S. President’s recent retreat from his previous rhetoric stances towards Iran should not be misinterpreted as the White House’s retreat from its policy of ‘maximum pressure’ on Iran. In line with its maximum pressure on Iran policy, on Friday the United States imposed new sanctions on Iran that target the country's petrochemical industry, including its largest petrochemical holding group, the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company (PGPIC). The main reason behind the changes to Trump administration’s tone against Iran in fact is internal pressure on him. Americans are against a new war in the region. Also opposition from the U.S. allies which will suffer from great losses in case of any war in the region is another reason behind change to Trump’s tone. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is slated to visit Tehran on Wednesday June 12. He hopes to use his warm relation with Iran and the U.S. to mediate between the countries. Besides Abe’s warm relations with Iranian and the U.S. leaders there are others reasons that potentially make him a proper mediator including Japan’s efforts to have independent Middle East policy and not having imperialistic record in the region which is a good trust building factor for Iran. Above all, as the third largest economy of the world Japan is very dependent on the energy importing from the region. Japan imports 80 percent of its consuming energy from the Middle East which passes through Hormuz strait, so any war and confrontation in the region will inflict great losses and damages to the country’s economy and consequently to the world economy. To answer the question that how Mr. Abe’s efforts will be effective to settle the tensions depends on two factors. First on the ‘real will’ and determination of the U.S. and Iran to solve the ongoing problems especially the U.S. ‘real will’. One cannot ask for talk and at the same time further undermine the trust between the two sides by taking some hostile measures like new sanctions that the U.S. slapped against Iran’s petrochemical section last night on the eve of Mr. Abe’s visit to Tehran. If there is a real will, even no need to mediator. Second we have to wait to see that how the Japanese PM will be able to affect the U.S.’ decisions. Iran’s Keivan Khosravi spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council said efforts to remove U.S. extraterritorial sanctions against Iran could guarantee the success of Japanese PM’s visit to the Islamic Republic.
