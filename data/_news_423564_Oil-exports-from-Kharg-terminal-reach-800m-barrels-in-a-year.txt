TEHRAN - Iran exported 800 million barrels of crude oil from Kharg Island terminal in south part of the country during the last Iranian calendar year 1396 (ended on March 20), Shana reported on Monday quoting an oil official. “It is safe to say that currently the country does not have any unsold oil stored at sea”, Pirouz Mousavi, the managing director of Iranian Oil Terminals Company (IOTC) said. Due to its close distance to oilfield regions, its good offshore position and suitable depth for gigantic oil vessels berthing, Kharg Island Oil Terminal has been recognized as one of the country’s most suitable places for crude oil export and loading sites.
