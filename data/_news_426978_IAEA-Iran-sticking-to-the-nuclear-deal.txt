Iran has remained within the main restrictions on its nuclear activities imposed by a 2015 deal with major powers, a confidential report by the UN atomic watchdog said on Thursday. In its second quarterly report since President Donald Trump announced in May that the United States would quit the accord and reimpose sanctions, the International Nuclear watchdog says Iran has stayed within caps on uranium enrichment levels, enriched uranium stocks and other items.Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iran had stayed within the caps on uranium enrichment levels, enriched uranium stocks and other items. In its most recent public report in May, the IAEA had said Iran could do more to cooperate with inspectors and thereby "enhance confidence," but stopped short of saying the Islamic Republic had given it cause for concern. Thursday's report to member states seen by Reuters contained similar language. It said the Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog was able to carry out all so-called complementary access inspections needed to verify Iran's compliance with the deal. "Timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access facilitates implementation of the Additional Protocol and enhances confidence," said the report, which was distributed to IAEA member states. "The production rate (of enriched uranium) is constant. There is no change whatsoever," a senior diplomat added.
