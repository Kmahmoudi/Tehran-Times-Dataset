"The Saudis are active at every level of the terror chain, from planners to financiers, from cadre to foot soldier, from ideologist to cheerleader," said Rand Corp. analyst Laurent Murawiec in his July 10 briefing to the Pentagon's defense policy board. "Saudi Arabia supports our enemies and attacks our allies," Murawiec said, describing the country as "the kernel of evil, the prime mover, the most dangerous opponent" in the Middle East. He said Washington should demand that Saudi Arabia stop funding fundamentalist Islamic outlets around the world, cease anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli statements, and "prosecute or isolate those involved in the terror chain, including the Saudi intelligence services." If Riyadh did not comply, Saudi oil fields and overseas financial assets should be "targeted", Murawiec added in his briefing, without specifying exactly how. Murawiec's comments did not reflect the Pentagon panel's views or official U.S. policy, although they had "growing currency" within the administration of President George W. Bush, the daily said. An unnamed U.S. official told the paper opinion about Saudi Arabia was changing rapidly within the U.S. government. "People used to rationalize Saudi behavior," the official said. "You don't hear that any more. There's no doubt that people are recognizing reality and recognizing that Saudi Arabia is a problem." A U.S. senator from the Democratic Party also accused Saudi Arabia of supporting Palestinian groups including Hamas. Senator Joseph Liebermann, who is considered to be one of the Democratic party's leaders and was the party's candidate for vice president in the 2000 U.S. presidential elections, said Washington and its allies should put pressure on Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia to end their backing of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. He told the Fox News Network on Sunday that Saudi Arabia is one of the financiers of Hamas and other groups fighting Israel, adding that this funding should be stopped. Liebermann, who is a fanatic supporter of Israel, praised U.S. President George W. Bush, who has given Tel Aviv the nod to crack down on Palestinians more severely in reprisal attacks. After a recent martyrdom-seeking operation which resulted in the death of five U.S. nationals, Israeli troops raided Nablus, killing and wounding several Palestinians. With the death of the U.S. citizens, Washington has given Israel the green light to carry out more violent attacks on Palestinian civilians. These reports indicate that U.S. officials, both Democrats and Republicans, have launched a program to weaken the Islamic world in order to achieve their economic and political objectives in the region. For instance, the U.S. administration has now focused all its efforts to topple the Iraqi government under the pretext that it is developing weapons of mass destruction, something which has not been confirmed independently. The stance taken by Washington indicates the White House officials' enmity toward Islam. Considering this hostility, Muslims must make a concerted effort toward unity and solidarity.
