TEHRAN —While the cabinet of ministers gave approval to a bill on mandating the use of car seats for children under 10 proposed by the traffic police, it is now brought before the Majlis [the Iranian Parliament] for the final approval. The Traffic Police Chief Taqi Mehri said that “using car seats is considered a requirement for children under the age of 10, but implementing it as a legal act requires the parliament approval,” IRNA reported on Saturday. “If the bill is approved by the Majlis, all children should necessarily use car seats for increased road safety, otherwise, in the case of any violations observed by the traffic forces, the drivers would be fined,” he explained. Regretting the fact that children aging less than 10 constitute approximately 8 percent of the traffic-related deaths, Mehri highlighted that using a child safety seat in the cars will definitely reduce the number of road crash casualties. “Despite the fact that the bill is yet to become a law, some people use car seats to ensure their children safety, which is highly appreciated,” he concluded. According to the World Health Organization the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that road safety is a prerequisite to ensuring healthy lives, promoting well-being and making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.  The Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020, officially proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in March 2010, seeks to save millions of lives by building road safety management capacity; improving the safety of road infrastructure; further developing the safety of vehicles; enhancing the behavior of road users; and improving post-crash response. Guided by the Global Plan, the Decade of Action offers a framework for policy, practice and advocacy to help countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.  FB/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
