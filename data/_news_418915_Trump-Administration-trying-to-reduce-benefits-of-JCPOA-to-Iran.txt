TEHRAN - A former assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology says “Since the IAEA has been finding Iran in compliance with the JCPOA at its declared nuclear sites, the only option open to opponents to the JCPOA is to raise the possibility of non-compliance at other sites.” “I agree that the Trump Administration is trying to reduce the benefits of the JCPOA to Iran,”Frank N. von Hippel, emeritus Professor of Public and International Affairs form Princeton University tells the Tehran Times in an exclusive interview. Following is the full text of the interview: Q: U.S. delegation in IAEA after recent session in IAEA announced that “We welcome the Director General’s statement that the IAEA continues to evaluate Iran’s declarations under the Additional Protocol, and to conduct complementary access inspections to sites and locations in Iran. Any new and credible concerns of undeclared nuclear activities, including any potential weaponization-related issues, can and must be pursued by the IAEA. According to this, what means “complementary access inspections to sites and locations in Iran”? Is this access beyond the Additional Protocol? A: No, this is the terminology used to describe inspections under the Additional Protocol. Q: Why U.S. again try to bring up Iran PMD Case in IAEA? A: Since the IAEA has been finding Iran in compliance with the JCPOA at its declared nuclear sites, the only option open to opponents to the JCPOA is to raise the possibility of non-compliance at other sites. Q: Iran's Ambassador to the IAEA Reza Najafi highlighted that “ by limiting Iran’s benefits from the deal the US Government in contradiction with both letter and spirit of the agreement, particularly paragraphs 26, 28 and 29 of the JCPOA, has taken a negative approach to undermine “successful implementation” of the JCPOA.” This statement is while U.S. try to place sanction Iran on the name of Human Rights and terrorism. What will happen for JCPOA if Iran limited from benefiting of the agreement? 
A: I agree that the Trump Administration is trying to reduce the benefits of the JCPOA to Iran.  It would be convenient to the Trump Administration if this provoked Iran to withdraw from the JCPOA. Then the U.S. would not have the international onus of having destroyed the JCPOA. I hope that Iran does not fall into this trap.
