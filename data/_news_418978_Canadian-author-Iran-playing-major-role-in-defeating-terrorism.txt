TEHRAN – A senior Canadian author and political commentator has praised Iran’s anti-terrorism campaign in the Middle East, saying the Islamic Republic has been fighting the phenomenon while the West’s support for terror groups in the region is well documented. Iran has “acted in accordance with international law, and it is to be commended for its efforts,” Mark Taliano said in an interview with Tasnim News Agency published on Saturday.  He added that the West and its allies “have been directly supporting terrorist groups since well before the war on Syria started.” MH/PA
