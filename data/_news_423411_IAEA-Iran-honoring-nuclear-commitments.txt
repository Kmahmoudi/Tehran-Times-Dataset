TEHRAN – Iran is continuing to implement its commitments under the nuclear deal (JCPOA) with major powers, the UN atomic watchdog overseeing the deal said on Wednesday, Reuters reported. “Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime under the JCPOA, which is a significant verification gain,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano said in a statement. “As of today, the IAEA can confirm that the nuclear-related commitments are being implemented by Iran,” he said, adding that the IAEA was “closely monitoring developments” related to the deal.
