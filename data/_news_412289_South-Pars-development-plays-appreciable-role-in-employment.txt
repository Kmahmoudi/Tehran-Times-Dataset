TEHRAN- Implementing development phases of Iran’s South Pars gas field (in the Persian Gulf) was one of the promises made by Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh which came true and besides boosting gas production noticeably it played significant part in job creation.
 As ISNA reported, the field is projected to have 40 platforms and 13 refineries once all development phases are completed. Some 25 platforms and 10 refineries are in operation at the moment. Mohammad Meshkinfam, the managing director of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), which is in charge of operating development phases of South Pars, referred to the oil minister’s promise about adding 300 million cubic meters (mcm) to the daily gas output of South Pars and said the promise came true as the result of efforts made by the Oil Ministry, National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), POGC and domestic contractors. He said the field’s output will reach about 725 mcm through completing the remained phases by the end of the next Iranian calendar year (March 2019). South Pars gas field, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate.
