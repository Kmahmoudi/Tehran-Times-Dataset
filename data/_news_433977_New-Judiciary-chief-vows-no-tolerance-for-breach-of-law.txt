TEHRAN - Hojjatoleslam Ebrahim Raeisi, Iran’s new judiciary chief, said on Monday that no one at any position can violate law.
 During a speech at his inauguration ceremony, Raeisi said that the issue of respecting law should be taken seriously. Raeisi said that he will make any efforts to uphold the people’s rights. He attached great importance to administer justice at the “second phase of the revolution”. The second phase of the revolution is a reference to a statement issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution after people massively participated in the rallies marking the 40 anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on February 11. In his statement, the Leader asked the youth to take “the second great step” for the progress of the revolution", insisted on the need to administer “justice and fight against corruption”, and attached an emphasis on science and research, economy, independence, freedom, national dignity, and foreign relations. Uphold freedom and civil rights Elsewhere in his inauguration ceremony, Raeisi said that it is essential to protect the people’s freedom and civil rights. “We will support any brave manager who does not recognize any impediment especially under current situation in which cruel sanctions have been imposed on the country. We will support any investment and entrepreneur,” the top judge promised. “Many efforts have been made; however, the people still have concerns about administration of justice and their key demand is to see justice at various levels more than ever. Therefore, the legal transformation needs to be based on the second phase. The government and Majlis (parliament) should cooperate in legal transformation,” he said. In a decree issued on Thursday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei officially appointed Hojatoleslam Raeisi as the new head of the Judiciary, replacing Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani who served in the post for more than nine years. The Leader cited knowledge, experience, and competence displayed by Raeisi at various junctures and his long-term service in the Judiciary as the basis of his decision. “The onset of the fifth decade of the revolution and the completion of forty years after the formation of the Judiciary based on Fiqh and Islamic laws necessitates that relying on the experiences, achievements and guidelines that have been gained during this period of time, a change in accordance with the needs, advancements, and shortcomings be applied within the Judicial Branch, so that  with fresh energy and increased motivation as well as wisdom-based discipline and management, the department of Justice vigorously starts a new era, which deservingly fits the second phase of the Revolution,” the Leader said in his decree, according to the khamenei.ir  Ayatollah Khamenei said it is essential that the Judiciary fight “corruption”.
