TEHRAN – Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Friday mocked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks at the UN General Assembly, saying some people must have been playing a prank on him. “I think some people are playing a prank on Netanyahu, and this time, they have directed him to Turquz-abad,” Araqchi stated, responding to the Israeli ruler’s claim that Israel had identified a “secret atomic warehouse” in Tehran. Earlier, Netanyahu had said, “In May, we exposed the site of Iran’s secret atomic archive, right here, in the Shor-abad District of Tehran. Today I’m revealing the site of a second facility, Iran’s secret atomic warehouse.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
