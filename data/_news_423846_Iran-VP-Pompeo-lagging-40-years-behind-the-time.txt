TEHRAN – Iranian Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Tuesday that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is lagging 40 years behind the time, pointing to the 1979 Islamic Revolution as a backlash against foreign influence. On Monday, Pompeo said the U.S. will aim to “crush” Iran with economic and military pressure unless it changes its behavior in the Middle East.  “The Iranian nation brought about the Revolution so that no one would tell them what to do and what not to do,” Jahangiri tweeted. “One should speak with the Iranian nation with respect and logic not with threats,” the vice president added.
