Asghar Zare’an made the remarks on the sideline of an exhibition on Iran’s nuclear achievements in Kordestan on Sunday. Zare’an expressed the hope that the base would be finished and inaugurated in April 2020, Mehr reported. He added that the first phase of the project has been finalized with the cooperation of Russia. Iran is the 12th country that possesses this technology which has various medical and agricultural applications, he explained. Stable isotopes are non-radioactive forms of atoms.
