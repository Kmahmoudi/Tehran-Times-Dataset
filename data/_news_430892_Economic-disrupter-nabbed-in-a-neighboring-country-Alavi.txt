TEHRAN – Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said on Wednesday that an Iranian economic disruptor who had fled the country has been arrested in a neighboring country and returned to Iran. The intelligence chief refused to fully reveal the fugitive’s family name. Alavi also did not mention the name of the country she was caught. He said in a complex intelligence operation, Iranian agents managed to arrest Shirin N. for embezzling over 800 billion tomans (about $200 million) from one of Iran’s banks and fleeing abroad, Mehr quoted Alavi as saying. She had fled Iran with a fake identity and was illegally living in one of the neighboring countries with a fake passport for more than a year, he added.
