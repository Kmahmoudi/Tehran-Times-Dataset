TEHRAN — ‘Gilgamesh magazine’ is an Iranian eco-friendly quarterly publication which is being printed on stone paper and distributed by bike.  Paper hasn't always had the best reputation. In fact, it is the largest component of solid waste in landfills and it uses up vast quantities of trees. In an effort to preserve the environment some companies are evaluating their current processes and making some changes by using stone paper. Stone paper is 100 percent recyclable and compostable, reduces the toxic levels in garbage dumps, does not require trees during its production, does not require water at its production, and it requires 50 percent less energy to produce one ton of stone paper compared to regular pulp paper. Moreover, concurrent with the 98th week of the car-free Tuesday (a public spearheaded campaign encouraging people not to use their cars on Tuesdays to create a culture of using alternative transportation including biking, walking, carpooling, and taking public transportation) the Gilgamesh magazine began to distribute its publications by bike.  Therefore, in order to tackle air pollution, Gilgamesh quarterly magazine introduces the culture, tourism, history, and environment of Iran via Gilgamesh bikes throughout Tehran. Gilgamesh is named after the hero of the ancient epic poem from Mesopotamia of the same name with various sections of geography, Iranology, lifestyle, art, mythology, environment, and history.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
