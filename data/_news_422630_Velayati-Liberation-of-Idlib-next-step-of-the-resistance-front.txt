TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a top advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on international affairs, has stated that the next step of the resistance front in Syria is to liberate Idlib.

 In an interview with Iranian television on Friday evening on the sidelines of his visit to Syria, Velayati described the liberation of eastern Ghouta near Damascus as a victory for the entire resistance front. He emphasized that the liberation of eastern Ghouta is very important, referring to Syrian President Bashar Assad statement that “if we consider the terrorists in Syria as the body, the head of terrorists is in eastern Ghouta.” The senior politician who served as foreign minister for 16 years in the 1980s and 1990s called Syria an important link in the chain of resistance movement that began in Tehran and spread over to Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Palestine. According to Velayati, this link defies the Israeli and U.S.-dependent aggressors. “The terrorists suffered defeat in eastern Ghouta, which shows that American forces cannot compete with the resistance forces.” He concluded by saying that the more time passes, the greater the victories of the resistance front.  The senior politician added the U.S. will certainly have no choice but to leave the region.
