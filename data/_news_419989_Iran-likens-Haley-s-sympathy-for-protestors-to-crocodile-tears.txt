TEHRAN – Iran’s UN mission has released a statement likening U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley’s expression of sympathy for protestors in Iran to “disgusting crocodile tears”.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the U.S. ambassador and the other U.S. officials’ meddlesome comments on supporting violence and riot. Such remarks have been made to cover up the U.S. and its allies’ defeated policies in the region and to revenge from the brave and noble Iranian people,” the statement said. Haley praised Iranian protesters Tuesday and said that the U.S. is seeking emergency meetings with the Security Council in New York and the Human Rights Council in Geneva regarding Iran. Kairat Umarov, the president of the UN Security Council, said in a press conference on Tuesday that the 15-member body is not currently planning to hold an emergency meeting on Iran. The statement by the Iran UN mission noted that Iran will not forget the “shameful” record of the U.S. interferences since the coup d’état against the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosadeq in 1953. “Iran’s security and stability depend on the people and the Iranians will protect the Islamic revolution’s achievements in spite of the recent commotion and will not let their historic achievements be ruined by violence,” the statement added. Since Thursday, groups of protesters have held rallies in several cities across the country to voice their anger over rising prices, unemployment and corruption. The protests initially started peacefully but turned violent in some cases when hooligans joined the demonstrators. Since the start of the riots, U.S. President Donald Trump has posted several insulting tweets in supporting the protests.
