TEHRAN — An Iranian knowledge-based company succeed in manufacturing oral iron chelator, deferasirox, domestically, Mehr news agency reported.
 Deferasirox is an oral iron chelator. Its main use is to reduce chronic iron overload, also known as transfusional iron overload, in patients who are receiving long-term blood transfusions for conditions such as beta-thalassemia and other chronic anemia. The CEO of the Iranian knowledge-based company, has explained that this is the first time the medication is being produced in the country saying that so far the drug was imported to Iran which resulted in massive outflow of currency.  The costs of the home-grown medicine will be covered by insurance companies, Behzad Taqipour highlighted.  While deferasirox should be normally taken on an empty stomach the domestically produced tablets can be taken on full stomach as well, Taqipour stated, adding that moreover, there is no need to dissolve the medicine in water or juice the homegrown tablets can be taken like other medicine. The bioavailability of deferasirox was increased to a variable extent when taken along with food. The tablets must therefore be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before food, preferably at the same time each day.  According to the U.S National Library of Medicine beta thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. In people with beta thalassemia, low levels of hemoglobin lead to a lack of oxygen in many parts of the body. Affected individuals also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. People with beta thalassemia are at an increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots. Beta thalassemia is classified into two types depending on the severity of symptoms: thalassemia major (also known as Cooley's anemia) and thalassemia intermedia. Of the two types, thalassemia major is more severe. MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
