TEHRAN – A top military adviser to the Leader says U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to commercialize the security of the world and region. Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi said on Monday the entirety of Trump’s strategy in the region and the larger world is to the benefit of U.S. government’s economic interests and against other nations’ security and independence. “He has told some Arab countries of the region that they have to pay the costs if they want America to stay in the region and protect their security,” Rahim Safavi said, Mehr reported. He also said Washington’s interference in the internal affairs of Venezuela is contrary to international law. “(However) Mr. Trump doesn’t know that the era of being a superpower and dominating other governments and nations is over,” he remarked. The general also underlined the importance of resistance in the victories gained in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, saying resistance is needed to defeat the American-Western-Zionist-Arab coalition.   He made a reference to the late political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski, saying his last book on decline of the U.S. power shows the Americans know that they are not superpower anymore. “They would have overthrown the Bashar al-Assad government if they were able to,” Rahim Safavi argued. A new source of power consisting of China, Russia and India has been formed and another one is being formed in the Muslim world, which the Europeans and Americans do not want to mention, he added.
