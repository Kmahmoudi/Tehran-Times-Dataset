Ansari told the Mehr News Agency that encouraging people to vote in the seventh Majlis elections requires certain measures, adding that merely inviting people to the polling booths will not guarantee a high turnout. The Expediency Council member said that there has been some negative propaganda against the government and the Majlis, adding that people should made be aware of the services the government and parliament provides in order to encourage them to increase their participation in the country’s affairs. Ansari also highlighted the importance of the Majlis and said that voter turnout in the seventh Majlis elections would play a significant role in determining the destiny of the country. The Iranian nation, particularly the youth, should realize that their vote will become the foundation of the country’s decision-making process, he said. Ansari, who is also a member of the Assembly of Experts, said that political groups and parties should compete with each other in a fair and honorable manner and should avoid the use of slander and dirty tricks, adding that this could result in a fair and successful election. Ansari pointed to the necessity of unity and concord between voters and electoral officials and added that the current situation in Iran is worrying. There has been a long dispute between the Guardian Council and the Interior Ministry on the electoral law, which could discourage people, he said. The Majlis deputy also said that people should be assured that candidates that they find acceptable will be able to easily qualify for the elections. Hopefully we will experience a free, Islamic, and open election with the help of a joint committee which has recently been established by the president, the Majlis speaker, and the secretary of the Guardian Council, he said. Ansari added that people should be informed that the anti-Iranian propaganda of the Zionist and U.S. media is only meant to promote their own interests and is not in the best interests of Iran. Imam Khomeini constantly reminded the people about the fact that if your enemies are sensitive about a matter then it is to your benefit to respond, he said. Ansari stressed that the Iranian nation is vigilant and has stood against its enemies many times in recent years. Thus, in light of the U.S. threats, the Iranian nation should participate in record numbers in the seventh Majlis elections, he said in conclusion.
