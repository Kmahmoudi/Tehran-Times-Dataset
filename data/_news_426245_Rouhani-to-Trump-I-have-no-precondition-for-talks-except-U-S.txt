TEHRAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he has no precondition for talks with the U.S., except that Washington “compensate” the past damage that it has done to Iran.
 “America owes Iran both apologies and reparations for the meddling and damages he has been doing to Iran since 1953,” Rouhani told a televised program on Monday evening. He added, “America can sit down for talks about the damage… and for example say in how many installations it is going to repay… because it is in debt to the Iranian nation.” “First, Trump has to prove that talks can resolve any issue. What do negotiations mean when they are accompanied by sanctions?” Rouhani asksThe president underlined his appreciation for genuine talks, pointing out that his administration took office with the promise to welcome “negotiations” and “diplomacy”. However, he noted, the U.S. president is boasting of talks at a time when he has “already walked out of all his international commitments, from the Paris agreement to trade agreements.” “First, he has to prove that talks can resolve any issue. What do negotiations mean when they are accompanied by sanctions?” Rouhani asked, adding, “The addressee of this [invitation to talks] is not the Iranian government. This is either a psychological warfare against the people of Iran or [aimed at] winning the upcoming Congress elections.” Rouhani also appreciated efforts by the European Union and the three European parties to the nuclear deal (the UK, France, and Germany) for their support for Iran and positions that they took against U.S. withdrawal from the deal. “They did greatly politically, but in the meantime they have to show what plans they have to make up [for U.S. withdrawal] in practice.” SP/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
