TEHRAN- Iran is set to produce Hemophilia medicines using domestically produced plasma by the Iranian year 1400 (March 2021-March 2022), said the managing director of Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO).  Ali-Akbar Pour-Fathollah made the remarks on the occasion of World Hemophilia Day on April 17, YJC reported.  Plasma is the largest single component of blood, and makes up about 55% of total blood volume. It is a vital source material for a number of plasma-derived medications that treat and prevent life-threatening diseases, illnesses and conditions. Plasma can't be created in a laboratory; rather, it is usually derived from people donating their plasma. “Iran is among the top countries in treating Hemophilia, and even though we are a developing country, the lion share of medicine and medical care given to the patients are free of charge,” said Pour-Fathollah.  "Iran is among the top countries in treating Hemophilia, and even though we are a developing country, the lion share of medicine and medical care given to the patients are free of charge."“Annually, 400,000 units of plasma are produced in the country. Currently, IBTO separates plasma from the blood with standard international procedures and then sends it to European countries, so the required medicines are produced,” he added.  “By using homegrown plasma in producing medicines, we can prevent the diseases caused by environmental change and emerging diseases; moreover, we can have confident in the safety and high-quality of the plasma we use,” he further noted.  SJ/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
