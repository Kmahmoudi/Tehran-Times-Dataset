KAZAN, Russia – Iran national football team striker Mehdi Taremi says they are not afraid of any team in the 2018 World Cup. Ahead of a crucial match against Spain in Group B of the 2018 World Cup, Taremi says Team Melli have the potential to qualify for the next stage for the first time. “We won a great match against Morocco and the words cannot describe the joy and happiness we feel when the final whistle blew,” Taremi said. “Iran were under pressure against Morocco in the first 15 minutes but we controlled the match towards the end. We had some goal scoring chances but failed to convert them into the goal,” he added. He came off the bench at the last minutes of the match against Morocco and played a role in Team Melli’s victory over the Lions of Atlas. “I felt pain in my back and played with pain for my people but I am hopeful of quick recovery for the coming matches,” Al Gharffa striker stated. “We want to make history in the World Cup and make our people happy, that’s why we are here. Team Melli respect all the teams but we are not afraid of any team,” Taremi concluded. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
