In fact the Leiden’s top 50 is heavily dominated by Chinese universities.

The underlying bibliometric methodology is richly documented. The Leiden Ranking provides information exclusively about the research done at universities. Research is represented in publications, and carefully collected data about these publications forms the basis for the Leiden Ranking. This basis also ensures the independence of the Leiden Ranking, since it does not rely on data submitted by the universities themselves. Finally, because universities are complex institutions that have a variety of forms, contexts and missions, their performance cannot be represented by a single number. The Leiden Ranking consistently presents different indicators to explore the performance of universities from different angles.
