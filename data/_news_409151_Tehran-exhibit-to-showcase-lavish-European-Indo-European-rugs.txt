The Carpet Museum of Iran is situated on North Kargar St. beside Laleh Park in central Tehran. It showcases variety of Persian carpets from all over the country, majority of which date from the 16th century onwards. Experts say modern weavers have inherited rich traditions from ancient nomads of Central and West Asia, who developed woolen carpets as a shield against sever weather conditions. The oldest-known hand-knotted Oriental rug was excavated from the Altai Mountains of Central Asia near Pazryk in 1948. Dating from the 4th century BC, the rug was found in a semi-frozen Scythin burial mound. It is currently on display at the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad, Russia.
