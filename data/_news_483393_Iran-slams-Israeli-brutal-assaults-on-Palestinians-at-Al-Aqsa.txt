TEHRAN- The savage assault by Israeli troops on Palestinian worshipers at the al-Aqsa Mosque during the holy month of Ramadan was denounced on Wednesday by the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson. “The brutal attack by the usurping Zionist regime’s military on Palestinian pilgrims and worshipers inside al-Aqsa Mosque has once again laid bare the criminal and inhumane nature of the regime before the eyes of the world,” Nasser Kanaani wrote on his Twitter account. “This crime is severely denounced and needs the quick response of the Muslim world, freedom-loving people across the world, as well as responsible international entities,” he noted.  On Tuesday night, dozens of heavily armed Israeli soldiers entered the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, shooting tear gas and stun grenades into the Qibli prayer hall, where hundreds of men, women, elderly people, and children had gathered to pray.  According to several eyewitnesses, rubber-coated steel bullets were also fired. Then, before detaining the worshipers, Israeli police pummeled them with batons and riot guns, inflicting several injuries. The Arab League was set to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the Israeli police raid on the Al-Aqsa Mosque that left at least 12 Palestinians injured, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was working to “maintain the status quo” at the holy site, Al Jazeera reported. The Arab League meeting has been called by Jordan, Egypt and Palestinian officials. The raids continued into the Wednesday morning when Israeli forces were once again seen assaulting and pushing Palestinians out of the compound and preventing them from praying – before Israelis were allowed in under police protection. The League had earlier condemned the attack, with Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit saying in a statement: “The extremist approaches that control the policy of the Israeli government will lead to widespread confrontations with the Palestinians if they are not put to an end.” At least 400 Palestinians were arrested on Wednesday and remain in Israeli custody, according to Palestinian officials. They are being held at a police station in Atarot in occupied East Jerusalem al-Quds. Palestinian witnesses said Israeli forces used excessive force including stun grenades and tear gas, causing suffocation injuries to the worshippers, and beatings with batons and rifles.
