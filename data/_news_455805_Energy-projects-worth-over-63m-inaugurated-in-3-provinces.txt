TEHRAN – Numerous energy projects worth over 2.67 trillion rials (about $63.5 million) were inaugurated in three provinces in the 32nd week of the Energy Ministry’s A-B-Iran program, IRNA reported. In a ceremony attended by the Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian, 14 projects including the establishment of some electricity transmission lines, solar and wind farms, and small-scale power plants, as well as increasing the capacity of a power plant, were inaugurated through video conferences in Khorasan Razavi, Semnan and Kordestan provinces. Of the mentioned projects, eight were put into operation in Khorasan Razavi province, five were in Semnan and the other one was inaugurated in Kordestan province. As reported, the mentioned projects have been put into operation with the aim of increasing the reliability of the electricity network, reducing unwanted blackouts, supplying electricity to the Mehr housing projects, increasing the country’s electricity generation capacity, managing water and gas consumption, and providing electricity to 45 rural households.
