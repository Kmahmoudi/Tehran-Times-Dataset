Pakistani Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said that Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline (IP) project is still affected by the west-imposed sanctions on Iran. Talking to a private television channel, he added, “Pakistani and Iranian authorities are engaged in talks over the project and Iranians do consider our problems regarding implementation of the project.”
Launched in 2010, the IP pipeline, once known as the peace pipeline, will cover a distance of 1,900 kilometers and bring natural gas from Iran to Pakistan. According to plans, initially it will bring 750 million cubic feet of gas per day, which will later be enhanced to one billion cubic feet per day.
While Iran has completed its part of the gas pipeline, Pakistan has fallen behind the target to take delivery of gas, initially scheduled for 2014.
A large number of professionals believe that IP Gas Pipeline is an energy lifeline for Pakistan. In their view, due to common borders with Iran, financially and geographically it is the most viable option for this country.  EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
