TEHRAN- Salt consumption in Iran is twice as much as global standards, the head of the Iranian Heart Association has said, Fars news agency reported on Thursday.  “The average salt intake among Iranians is around 10-12 grams per day, which is far beyond standard levels and it is mostly due to consuming breads that contain too much salt,” Fereydoun Noohi added. According to recent studies in the country, salt intake among women is three times the men, he noted. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults consume less than 5 grams (just under a teaspoon) of salt per day; however, based on global statistics, most people consume too much salt—on average 9–12 grams per day that is around twice the recommended maximum level of intake.  WHO has stated that salt intake of less than 5 grams per day for adults helps to reduce blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart attack.  National surveys in Iran has revealed that around 34% of Iranians have high blood pressure, leading to the prevalence of stroke and cardiovascular diseases to the extent that they are the second cause of death among Iranians over the age of 50, Noohi remarked. “Controlling high blood pressure is a must in today’s society. So, taking patients’ blood pressure should become a priority on doctors’ protocol. Additionally, the people must constantly check their own blood pressure at home with digital devices, especially if they are over the age of 35,” he explained.  SJ/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
