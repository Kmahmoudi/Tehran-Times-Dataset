TEHRAN - Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani said on Monday that it is necessary to fight the ideology of ISIS.
 The brutalities committed by ISIS, also called Daesh in its Arabic acronym, have shocked the world. Its savagery has proved more shocking than al-Qaeda. Just on July 14 at least 84 people were killed and 100 injured in the French city of Nice when a member of the shadowy group drove a lorry into a crowd celebrating the country's main national holiday. Also on July 23 a suicide bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed at least 90 people and injured more than 230 others, many of whom were taking part in a political demonstration. “Countering the ideology of Daesh is the most important priority in fighting terrorism without which no country will be safe and stable be it in the region [the Middle East] or Europe,” Shamkhani said during a meeting in Tehran with Nasser Khan Janjua, the National Security advisor of Pakistan. Shamkhani said that terrorism has turned into an international problem and calling it a “common threat” to Iran and Pakistan. He also called for expanding cooperation and working out a joint plan to counter any kinds of threats. The top Iranian security official also highlighted the necessity of monitoring the borders and taking joint actions in fighting drug trafficking and arms smuggling. In an indirect reference to Saudi Arabia, Iran’s security chief also said Tehran and Islamabad will not allow third countries to damage the friendly relationship between the two neighbors. “We will not let some countries to negatively influence the two countries’ relationship through sending arms and using terrorists to undermine security in border areas,” he noted. Elsewhere, Shamkhani expressed regret over the fact that “an Islamic country” is spending money based on the wishes of the enemies of the Islamic world to spread terrorism. For his part, the Pakistani official said Islamic countries should be vigilant against foreign plots aimed at spreading division among Muslims. Janjua also said that Pakistan will expand cooperation with Iran in economic and security areas. He expressed concern over the current situation in Islamic countries and said that crises are intended to undermine Islamic countries. Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Leader, also met separately with Janjua on Monday. Velayati said that Iran and Pakistan have many capacities to expand relations. “Our relations as two brothers are very good and we should seek more opportunities to boost relations between the two countries,” he added. Janjua said that Iran and Pakistan can help resolve crises in the Mideast region.  NA/PA     All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
