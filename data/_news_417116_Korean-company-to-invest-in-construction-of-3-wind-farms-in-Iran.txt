TERHAN- A South Korean company is to invest in construction of three wind farms in the south-eastern Iranian province of Sistan-Baluchestan, IRIB news reported on Sunday.
 As the report said, with the capacity of generating 150 megawatts of power each, the three wind farms are to become the largest ones in Iran. The project will cost $330 million and will be completed within the next two years, the report added. “Implementing this project, South Korea seeks expansion of economic ties with Iran in the field of renewable energies,” CEO of the South Korean company was quoted as saying in the same report. In late July, the former Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian said the country’s power generation capacity from renewable sources is planned to increase by 600 MW by the end of current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2018). Chitchian put Iran’s current renewable capacity at 420 MW. He said since 20 years ago Iran has been planning to increase renewable energy share in the country’s basket of energy and renewables account for 12,000 MW out of the 76,000 MW electricity generation capacity of Iran.
