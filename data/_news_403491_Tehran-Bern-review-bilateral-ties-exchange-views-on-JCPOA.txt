TEHRAN – Iran and Switzerland are mulling over potential areas of cooperation now that Tehran is emerging from economic sanctions.  Expansion of bilateral ties, particularly in the economic sector, was a major theme of the Thursday meeting between Iran Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi and Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter.
Takht-Ravanchi took a formal trip to Switzerland to attend political discussions between Tehran and Bern.
The two sides also shared ideas on the implantation of the nuclear deal as well as other relevant issues such as the banking row.
International banks have given the cold shoulder to Iran, fearing falling foul of potentially heavy fines by the U.S.
Expecting economic gains from the deal, the unsatisfied Tehran has complained that Washington is getting in the way of trade with Tehran, urging it to show serious commitment to the JCPOA by soothing the banking concerns.   
Also, expert panels from both sides conferred on a range of political and economic issues as well as counterterrorism and regional developments in the Middle East. The Swiss minister, for his part, laid emphasis on actualizing bilateral capacities and lending hands in regional issues.
After the signing of the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, with global powers, Iran has been welcoming foreign investors, seeking to revamp its stuttering economy through technology ownership and foreign investment.
To achieve the goal, it seems Tehran is leaning toward European countries in the post-deal era, which are benefitting from the cutting edge of technology in almost all areas.
Stronger friendship with the countries can also be used as a leverage for rainy days. The nuclear row could have been prevented, if Tehran had won macro deals with the green continent previously.
This change of tack, though negligent yet, is evidenced by President Rouhani’s trip to three European heavyweights of Germany, France, and Italy in January 2016, inking deals worth millions of dollars.
