TEHRAN – Following the accession of Israel to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as the 38th member of the task force, the situation has become tougher for Iran, ISNA said in a commentary on Saturday. One reason that the government insisted on passing the FATF-related bills was its concern about the accession of new members to this group, which unfortunately happened with Israel’s accession to the task force and became a concerning reality for Iran, ISNA added. Shlomit Wagman-Ratner, head of Israeli Justice Ministry’s anti-money laundering and terrorism financing department, said earlier that joining the FATF was a national strategic objective.
