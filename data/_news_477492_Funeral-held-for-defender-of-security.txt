TEHRAN- A funeral procession was held on Monday morning for Salman Amir-Ahmadi, who was martyred during the violent protests in Tehran. The funeral ceremony was attended by a large group of people, including Tehran’s governor general.  Amir-Ahmadi, called “the martyr of defense for security”, was killed in the Imamzadeh Hassan district of Tehran. In a report published on Monday, the IRAN newspaper said since the riots began on September 16 following the death of Mahsa Amini, 24 persons who were defenders of security have been martyred. “Unarmed people who attend the streets and alleys to protect the security of citizens against violence are martyred clandestinely by anti-revolution agents,” the newspaper said. It added in the early days of the riots most of the defenders of security were martyred by cold weapons but after the riots became more violent the number of martyrs started to increase.
