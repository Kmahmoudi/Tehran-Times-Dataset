TEHRAN – In a post on his Twitter account late on Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif highlighted again how Donald Trump’s national security advisor John Bolton is enthusiastically trying to drag the U.S. into a war with Iran. Today the world's catching on to @AmbJohnBolton’s chronic warmongering. But Iranians didn’t need to read a 10,000 word @NewYorker profile to be convinced: we've seen him shill for a cult terror group, and—along with his #B_Team accomplices—target Iranians with #EconomicTerrorism. pic.twitter.com/8n0UHyXOyq “Today, the world's catching on to Amb. John Bolton’s chronic warmongering,” Zarif tweeted. The remarks came after Zarif and Bolton had squared off on Fox News in separate interviews. Zarif told Fox News on Sunday that the “B-team”, that includes Bolton and number of regional leaders including of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Crown Prince Mahammad Bin Salman (MBS) and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, are trying to inflame U.S.-Iranian tensions and push Trump "into a confrontation he doesn't want." According to Press TV, Iran’s chief diplomat cited examples from U.S. media outlets and elsewhere to exemplify his remarks. The tweet incorporated a snapshot of a 2018 article in The New York Times that showed how Bolton had been promoting Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO or MEK), a notorious cult group which was on the U.S. terrorist list until September 2012, as a “viable opposition” and an alternative to the current ruling system in Iran. “We've seen him (Bolton) shill for a cult terror group,” Zarif remarked.  The Iranian foreign minister was referring to evidence showing how Bolton had received a $40,000 “speaking fee” to address the MEK’s annual gathering in Paris. Zarif says the world is seeing that Bolton is shilling for the cult MKO groupZarif also attached another image captured from a profile published by The New Yorker on Monday that detailed Bolton’s idiosyncrasies, including by citing remarks by a former senior advisor to the U.S. administration that “John wants to bomb everyone.” The foreign minister said it was not necessary that Iranians read a long story in the New Yorker to be “convinced” that Bolton is working hard to get the U.S. entangled in a war with Iran. “…Iranians didn’t need to read a 10,000-word New Yorker profile to be convinced,” Zarif chided. Also in a tweet on Sunday, Zarif asked whether Trump will let Bolton and other persons on the B-team “realize their dreams” to push the U.S. toward an unending war with Iran. “While John Bolton and the B-team say the Iranian people ‘deserve better’, they’ve admitted to targeting them with Economic Terrorism —and even war— in a delusional pursuit of ‘regime-change’. But will Donald Trump let them realize their dreams of another Forever War?” Zarif asked. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which had welcomed Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal in May 2018 and reimposition of sanctions on Iran, have said they are ready to pump more oil to compensate for Iran’s oil cut from the market as the U.S. announced on April 22 that it does not extend sanctions waivers on Iran’s oil exports.
