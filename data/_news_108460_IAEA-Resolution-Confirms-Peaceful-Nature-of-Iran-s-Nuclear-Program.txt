The resolution proved that Tehran has been following a peaceful and transparent nuclear energy program, the statement quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi as saying. The 35-nation board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency approved on Wednesday the European-drafted resolution about Iran’s nuclear program. The text adopted minutes after the IAEA meeting opened in Vienna Wednesday. What has happened in recent days was a failure for unilateral and pro-Israeli policies and a success for collective cooperation, participation and a policy based on dialogue and collective wisdom, the statement said. Despite a steady effort by some world arrogant circles the adoption of the resolution by the IAEA board of governors proved that Iran has never been trying to find access to nuclear weapons in the past or not going to find access to nuclear arms in the future. Iran expects the IAEA to have a sincere and constructive cooperation with Tehran in its future missions to Iran so that Iran could continue a serious cooperation with the IAEA based on the Tehran Declaration.
