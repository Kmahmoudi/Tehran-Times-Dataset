TEHRAN – Iran's Ambassador to London, Hamid Baeidinejad, on Sunday tweeted that U.S. President Donald Trump did not dare designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization. In another tweet, Baeidinejad said Trump failed to unravel the JCPOA but called Iranian nation terrorist and misquoted the Persian Gulf. “Undoubtedly, Trump, by assigning terrorist title to the Iranian nation and using a fake name for the Persian Gulf, made himself hated and detested by all Iranians regardless of their tendencies and attitudes,” he said in a message on his Telegram channel.
