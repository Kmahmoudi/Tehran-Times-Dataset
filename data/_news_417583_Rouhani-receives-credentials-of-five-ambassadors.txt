TEHRAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani received on Saturday credentials of the new ambassadors of Czech Republic, Norway, Greece, Switzerland and Nigeria in separate meetings.
 During his meeting with Swiss Ambassador Markus Leitner, Rouhani said that causing harm to the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, will harm international security and stability. “We hope that the European Union would counter wrong moves that disturb peace and impede international cooperation,” he said. He noted that the JCPOA helped create a more peaceful atmosphere in the world, saying, “Today, we are in a very sensitive and important situation which is not just restricted to Iran and the 5+1 group.” Rouhani insisted Tehran’s long held doctrine that Iran’s nuclear program has been and will remain peaceful. He added Iran will remain committed to the JCPOA as long as the other side respect the deal. However, the president noted, Iran will not be the first to violate the multilateral agreement. For his part, Ambassador Leitner said that Switzerland supports the JCPOA. As part of his new Iran strategy officially declared on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump decertified the nuclear deal and used harsh language against Iran. Rouhani, in response to Trump, said on Friday that Iran will respect the nuclear deal despite Washington’s new strategy. “We will respect the deal as long as our interests are met,” Rouhani said. However, he added, “If our partners would attempt to disregard their obligations under the deal, we will not hesitate a moment to respond.” Rouhani calls on EU to protect JCPOA During his meeting with Lars Nordrum, the Norwegian ambassador, Rouhani said Europe should play a “constructive role” in protecting the JCPOA. He said that the nuclear deal created many opportunities to negotiate on various international issues. Ambassador Nordrum said that all sides should remain committed to their obligations under the JCPOA as Iran is doing. ‘Nuclear deal benefits international security’ In a meeting with New Ambassador of Czech Republic Svatopluk Cumba, the Iranian president said the JCPOA benefits the international security and helps promote peace. Rouhani noted that the JCPOA has improved the situation for Iran and the European countries to expand cooperation. He also said that there is no obstacle for Iran and the Czech Republic to expand relations. The president also said Tehran attaches great importance to facilitating banking ties between the two countries. For his part, Cumba called for expansion of relations with Tehran in various areas. ‘Signatories who refuse to honor JCPOA are making mistake’  Rouhani, in the meeting with Greek Ambassador Dimitri Alexandrakis, said that the JCPOA proved the fact that dialogue is the best solution to international disputes. Alexandrakis also said Athens gives priority to preserving the nuclear deal and noted that the signatories who refuse to abide by the agreement are “making mistake”.
