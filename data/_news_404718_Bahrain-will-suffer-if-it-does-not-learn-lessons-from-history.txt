TEHRAN - The special advisor to Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Tuesday that Iran does not interfere in Bahrain’s affairs, but supports democracy, freedom of speech, and observation of human rights in the country.
 Hossein Amir-Abdollahian also said that trial of cleric Sheikh Isa Qassim is an “audacious” action. “The Bahraini government will be harmed if it does not learn lesson from history and repeats its mistakes,” he added. He reiterated on Tehran’s position that the crisis in Bahrain can be settled politically. Bahraini sources said on Monday that Manama will put the 79-year-old Shia cleric on trial on charges of “illegal fund collections, money laundering and helping terrorism”. The trial was set to be held on Wednesday, July 27. Sheikh Isa Qassim has denied all the allegations. In June, the dictatorial regime of Bahrain announced that it had revoked the citizenship of the major figure due to what they have called serving “foreign interest”. The act has been condemned by the UN and several human rights bodies. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
