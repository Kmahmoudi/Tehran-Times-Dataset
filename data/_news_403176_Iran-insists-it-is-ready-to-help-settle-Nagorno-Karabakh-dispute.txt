TEHRAN – Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani reiterated on Monday that Iran is ready to help settle the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave through “dialogue”. “Iran invites both sides to keep calm and show self restraint and highlights the necessity of preventing the intensification of the crisis that will threaten the collective interests of the regional countries,” he said during a meeting with Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian in Tehran. Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous enclave within Azerbaijan’s borders, populated mainly by ethnic Armenians who reject Azerbaijan’s rule. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is an ethnic conflict between the Republic of Armenia and Azerbaijan over the self-declared Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, a region in Azerbaijan populated primarily by ethnic Armenians. It has its origins in the early 20th century, although the present conflict began in 1988 and escalated into a full-scale war in the early 1990s. Tensions and border skirmishes have continued in the region despite an official cease-fire signed in 1994. Shamkhani praises ‘friendly’ ties with Armenia Shamkhani also said that expansion of cooperation in areas such as energy, agriculture and transportation will provide the ground for promoting economic ties. The security official also praised the “friendly” and “constructive” relations between the two countries. Elsewhere, he said that terrorism and overt and covert interference by the Tel Aviv regime in inflaming territorial disputes between nations are all intended to undermine regional stability and create security for Israel. For his part, Nalbandian said Yerevan is determined to boost relations with Iran given the new situation created after the conclusion of nuclear agreement between Iran and great powers. He also said it is necessary that the international community obstruct financial and arms support to the terrorist groups.
