TEHRAN – Iranian Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian said that more than 95 percent of Iran’s equipments needed in water and electricity sectors are produced inside the country, IRNA reported. The minister made the remarks in a visit to a production unit in north-central Alborz Province on Sunday. In his remarks Chitchian also stressed the importance of communication with the world saying that being self-sufficient doesn’t mean isolation from the world.  “Having positive relation and communication with other countries is a necessity,” he said. “Using other countries’ technologies, experiences and investment leads to prosperity and enhances technological development,” he noted. Earlier in January 2016, Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Houshang Falahatian had also announced that over 95 percent of the country’s power transmission grids are domestically built, adding that Iran is also self-sufficient in manufacturing its power distribution equipments. After the implementation of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran’s water and electricity sectors have experienced a great boom and foreign companies from all around the world expressed willingness to contribute to these sectors.  EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
