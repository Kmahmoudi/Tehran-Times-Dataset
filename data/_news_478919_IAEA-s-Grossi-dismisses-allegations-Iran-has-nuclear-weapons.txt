TEHRAN- IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said on Sunday that there is no evidence that Iran’s nuclear activities have been diverted to a weapons program.  Speaking with U.S.-based feature program “60 Minutes” broadcast on the CBS television, Grossi said that the IAEA does not believe the moment has come to recognize Iran as a nuclear power or to have any evidence suggesting that Iran is actively working on a nuclear weapons program. When asked how near he believed Tehran was to developing a nuclear weapon, Grossi said, "Iran already has a sufficient supply of enriched uranium at its present rate of production to build several weapons, should they so choose. However, we don't currently have any information that would suggest that Iran has a nuclear weapons program." When asked if Iran had crossed a line and if it was time to recognize it as a nuclear power, he responded, "No, we haven't reached that stage." “But in order to avoid getting there, we must work really hard,” he added. Grossi asserted earlier this month that Tehran was presently upholding its obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the official name for the 2015 nuclear deal. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany signed the JCPOA with Iran in July 2015. Joe Biden, the current U.S. president, has indicated that he is prepared to restore the pact after former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018. Since April 2021, Iran has been in discussions with the U.S., the UK, Germany, and France on reinstating the agreement.
