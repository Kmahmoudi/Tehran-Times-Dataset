TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday ordered the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) to take rapid steps to increase uranium enrichment capacities if the nuclear agreement falls apart.
 The order by the Leader came after Donald Trump on May 8 withdrew the U.S. from the internationally binding nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Trump also ordered sanctions against Iran and threatened if any foreign company cooperates with Iran it will face punishment. Ayatollah Khamenei ordered the AEOI to make preparations to increase uranium enrichment capacity “up to a level of 190,000 SWUs (separative work units) for the time being within the framework of the JCPOA” and take other preliminary steps that President Hassan Rouhani has ordered. "Some European governments expect the Iranian nation to both put up with sanctions and give up its nuclear activities and continue to observe limitations [on its nuclear program]. I tell those governments that this bad dream will never come true." Under the 2015 nuclear agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council, Iran was obliged to put limits on its nuclear enrichment in exchange for termination of all nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions. However, since Trump announced the U.S. exit from the accord some companies have started suspending operation in Iran. "The Iranian nation and government will not stand being under both sanctions and nuclear restrictions… The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran must immediately make the preparations for achieving [increased enrichment,)" Leader said in a high-profile speech marking the death anniversary of the late Imam Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic. The Leader added, "It seems from what they say that some European governments expect the Iranian nation to both put up with sanctions and give up its nuclear activities and continue to observe limitations [on its nuclear program]. I tell those governments that this bad dream will never come true." Ali Akbar Salehi, the AEOI chief, told a press conference on Tuesday that Iran has begun work to prepare the infrastructure for building advanced centrifuges at the Natanz enrichment facility, while respecting its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal. Also, on Tuesday the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEI) announced that Iran has informed the UN body of “tentative” plans to produce the feedstock for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium. “The Agency received a letter from Iran on 4 June informing the Agency that there is a tentative schedule to start production of UF6,” a spokesman for the IAEA said, referring to uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for centrifuges. Leaders says missile are ‘a source of power’ Elsewhere in his speech at the shrine of Imam Khomeini, Ayatollah Khamenei said Tehran will not accept any limits on its defense capability including its missile program, saying missiles are "a source of power". "Today the young generation has made Iran the No. 1 missile power of the region," the Leader tweeted later. "Our enemies know that if they hit us with one missile, they will be hit by 10 of them! Missiles are for security, they're a source of power." "Our enemies know that if they hit us with one missile, they will be hit by 10 of them." Trump has claimed that the nuclear deal should have included Iran’s missile program as well, but the JCPOA was just restricted to the Iranian nuclear program. Trump’s secretary of state Mike Pompeo went further on May 21, setting 12 conditions for Iran including abandonment of its nuclear work. Pompeo also threatened the “the strongest sanctions in history” against Iran if the country does not fulfill the demands. Since the 2015 nuclear agreement went into force in January 2016, the IAEA has issued 11 reports each time confirming that Iran is abiding by the terms of the agreement.
