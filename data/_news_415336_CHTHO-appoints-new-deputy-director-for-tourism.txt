TEHRAN – Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization Director Zahra Ahmadipour on Saturday appointed Mirhadi Qareseyyed-Romiani as the new deputy for tourism affairs.  Qareseyyed-Romiani replaced Morteza Rahmani-Movahhed who assumed the position in 2013. “A testament to your commitment, expertise, experience, and merit, you are appointed as the deputy for tourism while maintaining your [existing] position,” Ahmadipour wrote in a decree. “The cultural, social, and economic points of view toward tourism industry should be seriously developed as a cornerstone of the non-oil economy. It calls for paying special attention to science and research, and taking new approaches toward the international community.” Iran has launched extensive plans to bolster its tourism sector. Under its 2025 Tourism Vision Plan, the country is expecting to increase the number of tourism arrivals from 4.8 million in 2014 to 20 million in 2025.
