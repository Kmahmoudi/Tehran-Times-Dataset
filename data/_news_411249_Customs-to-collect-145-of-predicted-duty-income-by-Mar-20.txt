TEHRAN- Islamic Republic of Iran’s Customs Administration (IRICA) expects to earn 145 percent of the duty income predicted in the country’s national annual budget by the current Iranian calendar yearend (March 20, 2017), Mehr news agency reported. At the present time, tax income accounts for 36 percent of the government’s total income and 50 percent of the national annual budget, IRIB quoted National Tax Administration director Kamel Taqavinejad as saying on February 6.
President Hassan Rouhani’s economic strategy is to significantly reduce the government’s dependency on oil and instead collect tax more systematically. HJ/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
