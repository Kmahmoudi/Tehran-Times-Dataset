TEHRAN - Syrian Ambassador to Tehran Adnan Mahmoud said Iranian companies are the top priority in awarding the country’s reconstruction projects, Shata reported on Thursday. Speaking in a meeting between the representatives of Syrian private sector with the Iranian Minister of Industry, Mines and Trade Reza Rahmani along with officials of the Iranian cooperatives chamber, Mahmoud noted that the Iranian private sector is a key partner in reconstruction of Syria's infrastructure. The ambassador stressed the need for providing facilities in order to further expand the economic cooperation between the two countries. He called for the implementation of a free trade agreement between the two countries so that the two sides can have a comprehensive economic partnership with each other. A trade delegation from Syria visited Iran on March 11 to attend a business forum which was held at Iran Chamber of Cooperatives in Tehran and also to hold talks with Iranian private sector in order to encourage them to cooperate in the war-stricken country’s reconstruction. Iran and Syria have been exchanging numerous trade delegations in the past few months and Iranian private companies are already investing in different areas like providing construction materials especially cement and working on several reconstruction projects in Syria. In August 2018, a delegation comprised of Iranian economic experts traveled to Syria to explore investment opportunities and finalize the reconstruction plans of the war-stricken country. Also in January, the 14th preparatory meeting of Iran-Syria high joint technical committee of economic cooperation was held at Damascus. The event was attended by the Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Amir Amini and Deputy Head of the Planning and International Cooperation Authority of Syria Thoraya Idlbi. Amini had also said that Iranian private sector has started cooperation with Syria in order to rebuild the country’s war-damaged infrastructures. According to the official, Iranian investors and enterprises are eager to play a key role in Syria’s potential $600-billion worth of projects. Many urban areas across Syria, particularly around Damascus, have been hard-hit by war, and President Bashar Assad said this month that rebuilding would be his “top priority”.
