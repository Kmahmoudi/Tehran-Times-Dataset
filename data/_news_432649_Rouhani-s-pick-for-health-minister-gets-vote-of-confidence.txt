TEHRAN – Iranian Lawmakers on Monday gave their vote of confidence to President Hassan Rouhani’s health minister nominee, Saeed Namaki. During an open session of the parliament, the president took the podium to defend his choice, who was later approved with 229 in favor, 25 against and 4 abstentions. Namaki has served as the scientific, cultural, and social deputy chief of the Planning and Budget Organization. The former health minister, Hassan Qazizadeh-Hashemi, resigned last month after a row over the budget allocated to his department. According to the budget bill proposed for the next fiscal year, 350 trillion rials (about $8.3 billion) will be allocated to the health sector.
