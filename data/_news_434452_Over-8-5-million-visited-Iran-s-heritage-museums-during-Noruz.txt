TEHRAN – More than 8.5 million people paid visit to heritage museums and historical sites across Iran during the New Year (Noruz) holidays, which ended on April 2. “Over 8.5 million people toured Iran’s museums and other heritage sites (which have entry fees and are affiliated with the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization) during Noruz,” ISNA quoted Mohammadreza Kargar, the director of CHHTO museums and historical properties, as saying on Monday. The figure shows a 10 percent growth year on year, he said, adding that Tehran, Fars and Isfahan provinces hosted the highest numbers of visitors. Last September Kargar announced that some three million historical objects are being kept in the CHHTO-affiliated museums, adding “There are 600 museums across the country, some half of which are associated with private collectors or various institutions.” AFM/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
