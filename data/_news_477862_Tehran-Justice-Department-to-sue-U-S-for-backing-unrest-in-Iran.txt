TEHRAN- A top Iranian human rights official announced on Wednesday that a complaint will be filed in Tehran's Justice Department to assess the harm caused by the most recent riots in Iran with direct involvement of the U.S.  Tehran’s Justice Department has been tasked with filing a lawsuit in order to investigate the damages and meddling brought about by the United States’ direct involvement in the unrest, according to Kazem Gharibabadi, secretary of the Iranian High Council for Human Rights and deputy head of the Judiciary. Concerning the destructive role of television networks such as Iran International and BBC Persian in inciting protesters to destroy public and private property and training them to commit terrorist acts, he stated that the two television networks and their personnel should be added to the list of terrorist groups and individuals, and that the Islamic Republic is preparing documented cases on their anti-Iran attempts, which will be pursued by Iranian and foreign judiciaries in the near future. The Islamic Republic's legal system would not also disregard the involvement of countries like the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia in hosting and financially supporting Persian language TV networks, he stressed. Iran’s human rights chief also said the hosting country should take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of all diplomatic personnel and facilities and prevent any attacks on these targets. In order to uphold their obligations under international law, the countries where Iranian diplomatic facilities or personnel have been targeted should either prosecute those responsible for the assaults or extradite the offenders to Iran in accordance with the 1973 Convention.
