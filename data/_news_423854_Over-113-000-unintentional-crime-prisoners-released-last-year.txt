TEHRAN — More than 113,000 prisoners who had committed unintentional crimes were released in the past Iranian calendar year (March 2017-March 2018), IRNA news agency reported on Tuesday. Total debt of prisoners added up to about 7 trillion rials (nearly $166 million), however, some half of the debts were forgiven by the plaintiffs, Blood Money Organization’s director Asadollah Jolaei said. Last year, charity fundraising events helped free more than 10 thousand prisoners and contributions totaled nearly 5.7 trillion rials (nearly $135 million), he explained.
