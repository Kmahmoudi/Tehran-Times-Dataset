TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian paid a visit to EB patients on Wednesday, saying that the Iranian Foreign Ministry has taken a decision to impose sanctions on entities supporting sanctions and riots in Iran. The foreign minister was accompanied by Nasser Kanaani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. They spoke with the officials of EB Home, a non-governmental organization supporting EB patients.  Amir Abdollahian spoke to the EB Home officials and heard their problems, especially those emanating from “U.S. cruel sanctions,” according to a statement by the Foreign Ministry. Condemning sanctions on medicines including a special type of dressing needed for EB patients, Amir Abdollahian said, “Today, unilateral sanctions have become a modern tool for violating human rights.” Underling that some foreign parties have shed “crocodile tears” for the Iranian nations with the aim of creating riots in the country, the foreign minister said that the Foreign Ministry has made a decision to levy sanctions on parties playing a role in imposing sanctions on Iran as well as entities voicing support for unrest and riot in Iran.  Over the last weeks, Iran has been dealing with a wave of unrest sparked by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.  Amir Abdollahian said the new Iranian designations include at least four Western entities and 15 individuals.  “These individuals have played a role in the issue of sanctions, incitement to violence and extremism in Iran’s recent events, and they acted as agents for creating riots, insecurity, and extremism,” Amir Abdollahian said, according to IRNA.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
