TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Iran considers nuclear bomb and other weapons of mass destruction as religiously banned, but does anything necessary to increase its defense capability.
 “Of course we consider atomic bomb and weapons of mass destruction as haram but we strongly seek (to build) whatever necessary (to promote our defense power,” the Leader remarked. “Without a moment of hesitation, the country should move towards anything necessary for defense even if the whole world opposes,” he said during a meeting a large number of group from East Azerbaijan. He strongly criticized the Westerns who threaten the human being by their sophisticated weapons but are against Iran’s defensive missile power. “How this issue [Iran’s missile power] is related to you? You want to deprive the Iranian nation of missile and defense capabilities to bully them,” the Leader noted. Elsewhere, the Leader attached great importance to economic priorities, saying that more efforts should be done in line with resistance economy. He noted that relying on the people and domestic capacities are the solution to economic problems. “We saw the result of relying on foreigners in the issue of Barjam [the Persian name for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]. We trusted them in the nuclear talks but did not gain benefits. However, the officials deal with the issue very well and the foreign minister [Mohammad Javad Zarif] should be thanked for his behavior towards the malignancy of the U.S. and ambivalent behavior of Europeans,” Ayatollah Khamenei stated. “Some of these behavioral points were publicized, some weren’t; but, I am informed. Righteous and strong attitudes were shown. Yes, this the correct method: they should react. National dignity must be manifested,” khamenei.ir quoted the Leader as saying. Commenting on massive turnout in the February 11 rallies to mark the 39th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Khamenei called the event a “miracle”. “The 22nd of the month of Bahman [on the Persian calendar] was actually different this year,” Press TV quoted him as saying. He added, “After 39 years, this massive popular movement looks like a miracle. It does not exist anywhere in the world that after four decades, people themselves come to the scene, fill the streets, chant slogans, show their presence and defend their revolution.” Ayatollah Khamenei said that criticisms against the government, the Judiciary and the Leadership do not run contrary to defending the Islamic system and revolution. The Leader also said “move toward aristocracy” and giving up to “wealthy class instead of paying attention of poor classes” are a retreat from the ideals of the Islamic Revolution. He added people should monitor the “our behavior as responsible officials” with great sensitiivy.
