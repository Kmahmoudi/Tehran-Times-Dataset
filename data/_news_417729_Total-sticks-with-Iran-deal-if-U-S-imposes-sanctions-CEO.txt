TEHRAN - Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said his company will go ahead with Iran deal if the United States decides to impose unilateral sanctions on Teheran. According to Reuters, in an interview with International Oil Daily, Pouyanne said, however the company would examine the consequences of Trump's decision, and if there are any laws that obliges it to withdraw from Iran, then it will comply. "If Iran is compliant, if the European Union and China and Russia continue to consider that the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) can be applied, then that means the U.S. would have to take unilateral sanctions...," Pouyanne said in the interview published on Tuesday. "But we will try on our side to obtain the comfort that we can continue the project, which will be our priority," he added. Last week, Trump refused to formally certify that Iran was complying with the nuclear deal, defying both allies and adversaries. He warned that he might ultimately terminate the agreement. The U.S. Congress now has about two months to decide whether to reinstate sanctions. Total became the first Western oil major to sign an agreement with Iran to develop phase 11 of Iran's South Pars, the world's largest gas field. Total is the operator of the $5 billion project with a 50.1 percent stake. EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
