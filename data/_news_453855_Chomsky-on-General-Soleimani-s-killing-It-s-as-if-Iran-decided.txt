American polymath Noam Chomsky has said the assassination of top Iranian commander Lt. General Qassem Soleimani has shown that the U.S. is a "rogue state" that has no regard for international law. “The murder of Soleimnai… is an extraordinarily dangerous act. Nothing like that happened during the Second World War or during the Cold War,” Chomsky said in an interview on Wednesday. “It’s as if Iran had decided to murder (U.S. Secretary of State) Mike Pompeo and a major general along with him at Mexico City International Airport. We take that pretty serious and that is what the murder of Soleimani was,” he added. “Incidentally, it is praised here which is pretty astonishing; it shows how extreme the internal assumption is, that the United States is a rogue state, which has nothing to do with international law or obligations,” Chomsky said. The American professor further highlighted the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, saying Trump’s actions on Iran increases Washington-Tehran tensions. The pullout, he said, was a “violation of international law” as the agreement was authorized by the United Nations Security Council, he added, referring to UN Security Council Resolution 2231, Press TV reported. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a fatal drone strike on General Soleimani’s vehicle upon his arrival in Baghdad International Airport on January 3 at the invitation of the Iraqi government. The attack also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the second-in-command of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), as well as eight other Iranian and Iraqi people. The two commanders were highly popular because of the key role they played in eliminating the U.S.-sponsored Daesh terrorist group in the region, particularly in Iraq and Syria.
