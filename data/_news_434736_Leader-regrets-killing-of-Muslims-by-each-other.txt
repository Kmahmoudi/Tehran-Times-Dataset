TEHRAN - Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Monday that heads of certain Islamic countries do not follow teachings of Quran and instead follow infidels.
 “Unfortunately, heads of certain Islamic countries do not follow teachings of Quran but follow and serve the U.S. and the Zionists instead of being ‘harsh on infidels’ [a verse of Quran],” he said during a meeting with reciters and researchers of the holy book in Tehran. The Leader added, “They have paved the way for division and war such as wars in Syria and Yemen and kill Muslims instead of being ‘compassionate to one another’ [a verse of Quran].”  Yemen has been bombarded for four years. The one who bombards is Muslim in appearance, but has no mercy for Muslims,” he added. Ayatollah Khamenei said, “Quran has said ‘be harsh on infidels’. Some of us have forgotten this. Like those colluded with the U.S. and the Zionists who have stepped on the Palestinians’ blood and violated their rights. Now, many of the Arab countries’ leaders are of this group.” “Another group has forgotten ‘be compassionate to one another’. They reject and excommunicate [takfir] the believers in Allah, the Quran, and the Ka’ba. When there is no ‘compassionate to one another’, domestic wars are waged. Look at Syria and Yemen. Yemen has been bombarded for four years. The one who bombards is Muslim in appearance, but has no mercy for Muslims,” he added.  Elsewhere, the Leader said that the Iranians will become more determined in following the teachings of Quran as enemies become harsher towards them. “Following Quran brings us happiness, power and dignity,” he noted. He said, “Many wrongdoings, misunderstandings, disappointments, disloyalties, animosities and submissions to tyrannical powers result from being far from Quran and the spirituality and knowledge that come from it.” Ayatollah Khamenei said, “What the enemies are doing against Iran is the last breaths of their animosity towards the Islamic Republic.” Pointing to recent floods in the country, he likens the people’s moves to help those hit by floods to the youths’ moves in defending the country during the 1980s when Saddam Hussein’s army invaded Iran.
