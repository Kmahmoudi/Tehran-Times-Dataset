TEHRAN - Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani on Tuesday criticized the activities of the MKO terrorist group in Paris, France.
 “Any support for this terrorist group will send unfriendly messages to the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said during a meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault in Tehran. Shamkhani said that the Iranian people will not forget the treasonous acts of the MKO who sided with Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran in the 1980s. The security official also highlighted the importance of countering terrorism, saying adoption of double standards in war against terrorism will just lead to spread of violence. “It is essential to take practical steps to cut financial, media, and arms support for the terrorist groups,” he insisted, adding this should be done “through joint efforts of the international community”.
 
Commenting on the Syrian crisis, he said that the crisis should be settled politically. He also welcomed expansion of relations, especially in banking area, between Iran and France in the post-nuclear deal atmosphere. Ayrault, for his part, said that there is a bright future for political and economic relations between the two countries. He cited the sale of Airbus plane to Iran as an example of the bright future which has been created with the conclusion of the nuclear deal. The first plane, Airbus A321 that Iran purchased from the European aviation giant Airbus landed in Tehran’s Mehrabad airport on Jan. 12.
