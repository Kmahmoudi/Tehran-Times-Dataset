TEHRAN – The spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran has said if Iran develops nuclear watercraft propeller systems, they will comply with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

 Speaking to Alalam on Sunday, Behrooz Kamalvandi underlined however, that compliance with the JCPOA will not stop Iran from studying uranium enrichment beyond 3.5 percent as allowed under the deal. Those programs can be had, the theoretical side can be completed, and the practical phase carried out when restrictions are lifted, he said. SP/
