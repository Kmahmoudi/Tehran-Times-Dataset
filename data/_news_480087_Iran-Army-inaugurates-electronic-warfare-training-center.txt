TEHRAN – The Iranian Army has inaugurated an electronic warfare training center with the purpose of strengthening its electronic warfare capabilities.  The inauguration ceremony was attended by the chief commander of the Iranian Army Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, according to the IRIB News Agency.  Speaking at the ceremony, the senior commander said, “The field of electronic warfare in the army is beyond a branch and it is referred to as a power. Because any force that does not have the necessary strength in this area will be weak in many areas. On the other hand, electronic warfare will be decisive and effective as a separate force in battles.” He also said that progress in electronic warfare requires special attention and effort. “With the opening of the Army electronic warfare training center, the basic infrastructure has been provided. By using the ability of young people and the experiences of the top masters of the Air Force, this center will be upgraded to a power-enhancing complex in the field of electronic warfare,” General Mousavi explained.  “Our point of view is that this center should become a consultant in the field of electronic warfare for the army,” he said.  The opening of the center comes amid escalation of tensions between Iran and Israel. General Mousavi on Thursday starkly warned Israel and countries helping it pose a threat to Iran, asserting that the Islamic Republic will give a devastating response to any hostile move. Speaking before a group of top Army commanders, Mousavi said the hollow threatening rhetoric from the Zionist regime’s officials reveals their fear, according to Tasnim.  The army chief said the intensification of political feuds in Israel on the one hand and Israeli officials’ sense of insecurity in the region on the other has caused them to resort to ranting. The Zionist regime’s officials are well aware that they won’t afford to stand against Iran’s crushing response if they take any hostile action, the general warned. He also cautioned that Iran’s devastating response awaits any origin from where the interests of the Islamic Republic are violated or which offers any assistance to the Zionist regime. The Iranian Army is constantly and carefully monitoring the enemy’s moves and is well prepared to counter hostile actions firmly and at lightning speed, the commander added. Dismissing the comments by the Israeli officials as utter nonsense that result from the escalation of political discord within the Zionist regime and the outbreak of domestic legitimacy crisis in Israel, Major General Mousavi said the Israeli regime is plagued by political and security crises, experiences intense internal and external pressures, is grappling with scourge of financial and moral scandals and corruption, and is suffering from insecurity caused by the empowered Palestinian fighters.
