TEHRAN - It is “by no means acceptable” that the value of foreign currency keep rising constantly against the national currency rial, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on Friday. However, the Leader said, according to reports that he has received there is more “security and political reasons” behind this issue rather than economic ones. In a live televised speech starting at 11:30 local time on the occasion of Eid al-Adha or the Feast of Sacrifice, the Leader stressed that the U.S. dream to stop the Iranian nation's progress will never come true. Ayatollah Khamenei said circles in the U.S. have admitted failure to achieve goals through maximum pressure. The Leader added, “The U.S. has always sought to weaken Iranians’ morale since the beginning of the Islamic Revolution.” Ayatollah Khamenei insisted that the Iranian nation are “not impressed by enemies’ propaganda.”  Noting that the Iranian economy has become resilient in the face of sanctions, the Leader said, “The Iranians have turned U.S. brutal sanctions into an opportunity to gain self-sufficiency. Today Iran is capable of domestically producing equipment sanctioned by the U.S.”  The Leader of the Islamic Revolution noted that the U.S. sanctions are ostensibly against the government, but in reality, they are against the Iranian nation and these are examples of “crime”. “There is no doubt that the sanctions that the U.S. has slapped against the Iranian nation is a crime. Superficially, it is against the Islamic Republic, but in reality it is against the Iranian nation.”  ‘Washington’s aim is to crumble Iranian economy’ Elaborating on the purpose behind U.S. sanctions, the Leader said, “Their mid-term aim is to create limitations so that there would be no progress in scientific areas. Their long-term is to bankrupt the government and crumble the country’s economy so that it would no longer be able to survive.”      Along with these three purposes, the Leader pointed out, they want to cut Iran’s relations with countries which are members of the Axis of Resistance in the region, but “the cat dreams of mice”. Ayatollah Khamenei went on to say that sanctions have created problems for the country but part of the problems are linked to mismanagement. The Leader said recently the coronavirus has aggravated the problems. “Sanctions have created problems for us and there is no doubt in it, but all of our problems are not from sanctions. Sometimes it is because of management and recently it is also related to Corona.”   “Scene of wills” The Leader said along with the sanctions a “distortion” campaign is also underway against Iran. The enemies are seeking to reverse the realities in Iran in order demoralize the people and give a “wrong address”.   “If the distortion current is defeated, the sanctions current will definitely suffer defeat too because” the world is “the scene of wills”, Ayatollah Khamenei pointed out. The Leader went on to say that efforts to “separate” the country’s economy from oil is a “very important issue” and now foreigners either do not buy the Iranian oil or buy a small amount and “this a practice that we separate our economy from oil”. The Leader went on to say that definitely there is a “cure” for sanctions and definitely that “cure” is not giving in to U.S. pressure, because if “we back down they will raise new demands”.  They want Iran to abdicate its nuclear industry and reduce it deterrence capability to “one-tenth” and give up its regional power, the Leader noted, adding, “If it becomes so, they will not become content and make another demand.” ‘All should follow guidelines to fighting coronavirus during Muharram rituals’ Ayatollah Khamenei also said that healthcare guidelines set by the National Task Force for Fighting Coronavirus should be observed during the Muharram rituals. “All the mourners, mourning gatherings and eulogists must follow what is announced by the National Task Force for Fighting Coronavirus, because it is a very important issue,” the Leader asserted. He added, “What is announced by the National Task Force for Fighting Coronavirus must followed during mourning. I will respect what they announce as necessary. I advise all the mourners, mourning gatherings and eulogists to respect guidelines of the National Task Force for Fighting Coronavirus, otherwise, there will be a big disaster.” During the Muharram rituals, millions of Muslims commemorate martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hussein (AS), the grandson of Prophet Muhammad.
