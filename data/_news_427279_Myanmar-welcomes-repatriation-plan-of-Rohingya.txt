TEHRAN - After facing blistering criticism and outrage from across the world, Myanmar has welcomed the Bangladeshi government’s plan to begin the long-delayed process of repatriating Rohingya refugees back to their homeland. Speaking to media persons in the country’s administrative capital Naypyidaw on Friday, government spokesman Zaw Htay, citing Bangladeshi foreign minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali’s comments Wednesday, said the move was “very much welcomed” by Myanmar, a report in South China Morning Post stated. “We have always been hoping for this (beginning of repatriation) and I believe the rest of the process will go smoothly after that,” said Zaw Htay, who is also director general of the president’s office. On Wednesday, Bangladesh’s foreign minister said the repatriation of the Rohingyas would start soon and his government was ready to send back over 3,000 refugees. Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in November last year to repatriate Rohingya refugees from camps in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazaar to Rakhine State. But the process has been delayed. Almost a million Rohingya refugees at currently stationed in Bangladesh, who fled from Rakhine following the brutal crackdown of Myanmar military in August last year. The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Thursday ruled that it had the power to investigate the forced deportation of Rohingya to Bangladesh, even though Myanmar has not signed the statute.
