TEHRAN – A number of Majlis members on Saturday filed a proposal aimed at punishing the countries which follow suit the United States in sanctioning Iran.

 Signed by 52 MPs, the proposal says Iran should “use its amenities which hostile countries lack” as a lever to pressure the enemies of the Islamic Republic in retaliation for unilateral U.S. sanctions against Tehran. It particularly emphasizes restricting the trade of “oil and any other goods” from Iran by countries which accompany the U.S. in their anti-Iran sanctions, as well as the nationals of such countries.  It goes on to extend the boycott period to 10 years from the day a country is noticed in supporting anti-Iran sanctions. The proposal also prohibits the import of consumer goods to Iran from the U.S. and the countries that adhere to its sanctions against Iran. Last May, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the JCPOA – which had been negotiated under his predecessor – and re-imposed the anti-Iran sanctions that had been lifted under the landmark deal in 2016. The deal had been finalized in 2015 between the U.S., Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany to lift nuclear-related sanctions on Iran in exchange for limiting Tehran’s nuclear program. Despite Washington’s withdrawal, Iran has not left the deal yet, but has stressed that the remaining signatories to the agreement need to effectively offset the negative impacts of the U.S. pullout on Iran if they want Tehran to remain in it.
