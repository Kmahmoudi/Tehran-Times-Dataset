TEHRAN- To develop domestic railway network, 18 railbuses will be added to the Iranian rail transportation system by the end of the next calendar year (March 20, 2018), IRNA quoted Saeed Mohammadzadeh, the managing director of Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRIR). A railbus is a very lightweight type passenger rail vehicle (typically non-articulated or rigid frame) that shares many aspects of its construction with a bus, usually having a bus, or modified bus, body and having four wheels on a fixed base, instead of on bogies.
