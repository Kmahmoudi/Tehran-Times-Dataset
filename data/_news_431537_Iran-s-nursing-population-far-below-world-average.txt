TEHRAN- The population of nursing personnel in Iran is one quarter of the world average, announced the deputy director of Iran’s Nursing Organization.  Mohammad Sharifi Moghadam said the current nursing shortage is now at a critical point and should be quickly addressed, Fars news agency reported on Saturday.  “There is currently only one and half nursing personnel per 1000 population in the country, while in many countries including Georgia and Tajikistan there are around 6 nurses per 1000 population,” said Sharifi Moghadam. World Health Organization has announced that about 50% of its member states report to have less than 3 nursing and midwifery personnel per 1000 population. World Health Organization has announced that about 50% of its member states report to have less than 3 nursing and midwifery personnel per 1000 population (about 25% report to have less than 1).  In many countries nurses and midwives constitute more than 50% of the national health workforce. Though globally, it is estimated that by 2030, the shortage of nurses and midwives will reduce from the current 9 million to 7.6 million, the shortage in the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions will actually worsen. According to Sharifi Moghadam, in many countries, nurses have proper safety equipment and undergo a complete series of medical tests, periodically, however, such safety measures are not being carried out properly in Iran, exerting too much pressure on nurses. “We should identify and study the nurses’ problems and make changes in our management methods,” he concluded.  In an interview with IRNA on Saturday, Majlis (Iranian parliament) health committee chairman announced that as many as 10 to 15 thousand nurses must be hired in the country annually.  Heidar Ali Abedi added that Planning and Budget Organization has agreed to allocate the necessary budget so that the required nursing personnel can be hired in the next Iranian calendar year, starting March 21.  SJ/MQ/MG   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
