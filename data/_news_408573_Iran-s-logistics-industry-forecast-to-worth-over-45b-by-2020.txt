The size of the Iranian logistics industry will exceed $45 billion by 2020. Revival of economic growth is expected as phasing out of restrictions improves investor confidence, leading to consistent growth of the logistics industry from 2017.
“This industry is expected to benefit from investments related to the Iran’s Sixth Development Plan, which is likely to accelerate domestic economic activities, and contribute to the development of transportation infrastructure.” 
Iran is a key logistics hub in the region due to geographical location advantages, with access to Europe and Asia by land route, improving connectivity and trade relations with landlocked countries in Central Asia.  
Proposed logistics parks in border areas are expected to transform the warehousing segment during the forecast period, from 2016 to 2020. (Source: frost.com)
