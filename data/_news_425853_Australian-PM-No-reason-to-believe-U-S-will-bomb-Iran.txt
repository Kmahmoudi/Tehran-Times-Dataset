TEHRAN – Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has dismissed rumors that U.S. President Donald Trump will order the bombing of Iran as early as next month, saying there is “no reason” to believe such an act will take place. Turnbull was responding to claims in the Australian media that Trump is on the verge of ordering a strike to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities, The Daily Express reported on Friday. Australian network ABC reported senior figures within the Australian government believe Trump is preparing a strike, and that it could even happen next month. They also claimed both British and Australian intelligence agencies are helping the U.S. with targeting.
