TEHRAN – Gholam-Ali Hadad Adel, a senior principlist figure, said on Sunday that the soft war against Iran is more damaging than the Iraqi war against Iran in the 1980s.
 Addressing an annual gathering of pupils union, Hadad Adel said Iran has succeeded in managing affairs despite incessant pressures and threats against the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Hadad Adel, a literary figure who also holds a PhD in philosophy, said since the enemy has faced defeat in military war against Iran it has now turned to soft war against the country. There are “abundant reasons” that the U.S., Israel, and Britain, as the “sworn enemies” of the Islamic republic, are the leaders of the “strategy of soft war” against Iran in order to undermine the “divine beliefs and morality” of the youth who are considered the main assets of the Islamic Revolution. “I see the soft war front more extensive than Iraq’s war against Iran and this soft war has started with cyber war…” Concurrent with “destructive cultural activities” the enemy has also been putting great economic pressure on Iran under the pretext of the country’s nuclear program, said Hadad Adel, president of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature. He went on to say that the enemies are seeking to “cleanse” the despotic Shah regime in a way as if Iran was a “developed and free” society before the Islamic Revolution. Hadad Adel who served as a lawmaker in the parliament for four consecutive terms from 2000 to 2016, added that one of the plots of the enemies is to set “students and scholars” against the Islamic revolution and then claim that only “illiterate” persons are loyal to the Islamic Revolution. “This plot must be neutralized.”  PA/NA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
