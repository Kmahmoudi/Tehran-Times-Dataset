TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei authorized the Judiciary to pardon or commute the sentences of convicts under new conditions. The conditions were proposed by Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani on the occasions of the birth anniversary of Hazrat Zahra (SA), the beloved daughter of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and Iran’s New Year, due to begin on March 21. Under the conditions, the Judiciary will reduce three fourth of the jail terms of convicts sentenced up to a year, half of the jail terms of convicts sentenced to between a year and 20 years, and the remaining of the jail terms of convicts sentenced to more than 20 years provided they have served at least 10 years of their sentences.
