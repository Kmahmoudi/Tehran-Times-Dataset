TEHRAN - Iranian carmakers manufactured 612,000 passenger cars during the first 10 months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21, 2019-January 20, 2020), IRNA reported citing the data released by Industry, Mining and Trade Ministry. The ministry’s data show that car manufacturing in Iran has fallen 18.5 percent in the 10-month period of this year compared to the same period of time in the previous year. In the mentioned time span, Iranian carmakers also manufactured 1,675 buses, minibusses, and vans and 3,603 trucks, which indicates a 49.2 percent and 60.5 percent fall, respectively. Industry, Mining and Trade Minister Reza Rahmani has said that the policy of domestic manufacturing of auto parts should be seriously followed up and in this due capable manufacturers should be supported. According to the data released by the Codal website, three major Iranian carmakers, namely Iran Khodro (IKCO), SAIPA Group and Pars Khodro, had manufactured 604,806 vehicles during the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-December 22).  In mid-May 2019, Rahmani issued a directive on “strengthening domestic manufacturing of imported auto parts”. Addressing two of his deputies, Farshad Moqimi, deputy for industrial affairs, and Mohammad-Baqer Ali, the board chairman of Iran’s Industrial Development and Renovation Organization (IDRO), the minister put emphasis on using the highest potential of human resources for strengthening domestic manufacturing of auto parts which are currently imported to the country. Highlighting the orders of the Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei on supporting production in the current Iranian calendar year (began on March 21), which is named the year of “Pickup in Production” by the Leader, Rahmani stressed that cooperation among all carmakers, auto part manufacturers, knowledge-based companies and enterprises is vital for strengthening domestic manufacturing of imported auto parts. This movement should be all-out promoted to combat sanctions and also prevent the outflow of foreign currency from the country, the minister noted.
