TEHRAN – Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and the Zionist regime are trying to justify the war against Yemen by making false claims, IRGC Commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Tuesday. In an interview with the Yemeni TV channel al Masirah, General Jafari also said, “The unfounded and false claim that Iran is an obstacle on the path towards achieving peace in Yemen has been fabricated by the Saudis and Zionists.”  “By making such allegations, they want to create tensions and instability,” he added.
