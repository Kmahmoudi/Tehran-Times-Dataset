TEHRAN- The U.S., Israel, Saudi Arabia, and several European nations directly incited unrest in Iran, according to Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi, who said that "the leaders and organizers of those unrests were carefully trained in 8 countries for these unrests." Vahdi, who was speaking with the Shia and Sunni clerics in Gorgan, Golestan province, reiterated, "In the course of the recent plot, countries such as Germany and Britain, too, alongside Saudi Arabia and the Zionist regime, had openly established a headquarters and were busy supporting the rioters."  He said these countries attempted to turn the current events into “racial conflicts” by pretending to favor certain Iranian tribes and ethnic minorities.  This was a massive falsehood that the Iranian people of all races quickly shunned them, the interior minister pointed out. "Even though the enemy spent a lot of money on this hybrid war and unrest, their plans failed. Even though they are aware of this failure, they still insist on continuing the conflict," he continued. The interior minister emphasized that the oppressors' fake sympathy for nations had been demonstrated in the past, citing their backing for the massacre of Iraqi Kurds and Sunni Muslims in Mosul as examples.
