TEHRAN – Over the past year measures have been taken to support breadwinner women who have been charged with unintentional crimes, the vice president for women and family affairs said on Saturday. “We have signed an agreement with the association of supporting families of prisoners to become familiar with such families and take necessary measures toward supporting and empowering them,” ISNA quoted Shahindokht Molaverdi as saying. “People have proved that they always are on the forefront of running charity affairs. Officials can also join people in promoting the culture of altruism and generosity.”  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
