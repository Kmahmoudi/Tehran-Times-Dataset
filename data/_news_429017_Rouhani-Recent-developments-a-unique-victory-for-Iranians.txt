TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has termed as “unique” Iran’s political developments in recent months.
 “Who would have thought that representatives of the Iranian nation could gain victory at three great arenas in a few months?” he said at a session of parliaments held to give vote of confidence to four proposed ministers. He explained that Iran gained victory against the U.S. at the International Court of Justice in recent months. “Our nation has the upper hand politically and legally. The public opinion considers Iran a country which abides by its commitments and the U.S. a country which is not loyal to its promises and violates the international regulations,” he said. He also said, “It does not happen often that the U.S. makes a decision and its traditional allies abandon it.” Elsewhere, he called for unity to “bring the U.S. to knees”. “Undoubtedly, the people want us to solve their problems which is their right. We are duty bound to pass the problems through unity and integrity,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the nuclear agreement in May and reintroduced sanctions on Iran in August. The second wave of sanctions, which targets Iran’s oil exports and central bank, is due to start in early November. On October 3, the ICJ found that assurances offered by Washington in August that it would do its best to ensure sanctions would not affect humanitarian conditions were "not adequate to address fully the humanitarian and safety concerns raised" by Iran. In its provisional verdict, the ICJ ruled that the U.S. government should lift all bans on the free export of humanitarian goods like food and medicine to Iran which have been re-imposed after Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The ICJ, which is based in The Hague and is also known as the World Court, is the United Nations tribunal for resolving international disputes. Iran's filing asks the ICJ to order the United States to provisionally lift its sanctions ahead of more detailed arguments. European countries have criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the deal. On September 25, European Union foreign policy chief Mogherini announced that the bloc was creating a new payment mechanism to allow countries to transact with Iran while avoiding U.S. sanctions. ‘Foreign media tell people lies’ Rouhani also said that the foreign media exaggerate problems in Iran and tell the people lies. He noted that the foreign media seek to manipulate the people’s minds through false propaganda. Elsewhere, he said that the parliament and government will stand beside each other to solve the people’s problems. The parliament’s Saturday session was held to give vote of confidence to four minister proposed by Rouhani on October 21. Rouhani proposed to appoint Farhad Dejpasand as the minister of economy; Mohammad Eslami as minister of transport and urban development; Mohammad Shariatmadari as minister of cooperatives, labor, and social welfare; and Reza Rahmani as minister of industry, mine and trade.
