As a last word for defending his choices, Raisi said that the nomination of ministers was based on the criteria he had promised the people during the presidential campaigns. “I promised to select ministers based on the indicators such as expertise, anti-corruption and popularity,” he said. He emphasized that the practical and scientific competence had a major impact on the nomination of ministers. The president added his “absolute condition” for nominating all ministers has been their anti-corruption spirit. Raisi said corruption will not be tolerated by any person at any position in his government. “It will not be tolerated when it becomes clear that the person who cooperates with the government will show the slightest unhealthiness, not in the position of a minister, but in any other position,” he asserted.
