TEHRAN- Some four million hectares of land will be equipped with modern irrigation systems in Iran within the next 10 years, Iranian deputy agriculture minister announced. As IRIB news quoted Alimorad Akbari on Sunday, during the present Iranian year (ending March 20, 2017) the incumbent government has paid about 24 trillion rials (about $620.9 million) of finance to Agriculture Ministry for modernizing irrigation systems in the country. 
“Despite the water scarcity in Iran, we could manage to harvest more than 14 million tons of wheat in the current year through applying the mentioned systems,” he added. HJ/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
