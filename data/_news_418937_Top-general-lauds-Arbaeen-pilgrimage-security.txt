TEHRAN â€“ Major General Mohammad Baqeri, chief of the Iranian armed forces, on Thursday praised the high level of security during the Arbaeen pilgrimage earlier this month despite attempts by terrorist groups to create mayhem. Speaking to reporters, General Baqeri said many attempts were made to disrupt the Arbaeen rituals but all Iranian pilgrims taking part in the event returned home safely, ISNA reported. Around 20 million pilgrims from all over the world gathered in Karbala on Arbaeen day, which marks the end of a 40-day mourning period for the martyrdom of Imam Hussein (AS), the grandson of the Prophet Mohammad (S).
