TEHRAN – Professor Nader Entessar says the election of Donald Trump, as a “highly volatile, unpredictable and aggressive person”, should be “considered a very important event in the world because of the impact of his still evolving foreign policy on global stability." Trump’s victory in presidential election on November 8 (Aban 18 in the Persian calendar month) surprised the world. Entessar said the election of Trump as the U.S. president “will impact the American sociopolitical, economic, and cultural landscape in a way not seen in the United States in many decades.” The South Alabama University professor also numerated Brexit and heavy blows to Daesh as other important events in the Iranian calendar year 1395, falling between 21 March 2016 and 20 March 2017.  “Brexit was the most important event in Europe because of its long-term impact on European integration and Europe's foreign and domestic policies," he noted.  He also said, “The military setbacks suffered by Daesh in Syria and Iraq should be considered as important events, especially if Syria and Iraq manage to establish full control over liberated towns.” When asked about any important even in Asia, he said, “I don't think there was a specific event that stood out in Asia, but the crisis in South China Sea may lead to greater tension in Asia and impact U.S.-China relations negatively.”  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
