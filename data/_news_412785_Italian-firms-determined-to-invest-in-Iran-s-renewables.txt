TEHRAN – Italian companies are decisive to invest in renewable energy projects in southern Iran, IRNA reported quoting an Italian official as saying. According to the head of an Italian trade delegation visiting southern Hormozgan Province, considering the regions’ geographical characteristics Hormozgan has great potentials for establishing solar and wind power plants. “We will start with small 25 megawatts (MW) solar plants as pilot, and in the next steps we’ll go for bigger plants,” the Italian official said. Iran has also promised to support Italian companies in this regard and a 744-hectare solar farm has been considered for such projects. In April 2016, former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi traveled to Iran for economic and political talks with the senior Iranian officials and signed six cooperation agreements with Iran. During Renzi’s visit, Tehran and Rome signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on construction of 500 MW of renewable energy power plants in Iran. The planned projects will be completed in the next four years by the Italian investing companies.
