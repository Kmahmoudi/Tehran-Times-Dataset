Korean National Assembly Member Chong Ung Park, in an exclusive interview with the TEHRAN TIMES, said, "I present my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Khatami for his second unprecedented victory as president of the Islamic Republic." He was referring to the June 8th presidential election in Iran in which Khatami received over 22 million votes. Park is heading a South Korean parliamentary delegation visiting Iran. "Tension-free elections in Iran pave the way for foreign investors to come to Iran and start businesses," Park believes. "Korea supports the reform movement in Iran," he said. "Bilateral trade between Iran and South Korea reached $3.8 billion last year and this is a sign of friendly and trouble free relations between the two countries," Park argued. "The forthcoming visits of President Khatami to Seoul and Korean Foreign Minister Han Seung-Soo to Tehran will promote the expansion of bilateral relations in all areas of cooperation," Park noted. In response to a question on the status of women in South Korea, Park said, "Women in South Korea are active in all fields. Three are members of the country's cabinet and 16 are members of Parliament." He lauded Iran's ancient culture and civilization. Another Korean parliamentarian, Kim Seong Ho, also spoke to the TEHRAN TIMES and said, "The foreign media paint a distorted picture of Iran and very often try to give the impression that Iran is facing big crises." "But when we arrived here," Kim said, "we found Iran to be a peaceful and stable country." "Iranian women are very active and, unlike certain other Muslim countries, women are allowed to drive cars here," Kim noted. "I hope that Mr. Khatami, in his second term, will improve Iran's international relations," he said. According to another report, the Iran-South Korea Parliamentary Friendship Group arrived in Shiraz on Thursday. Park Chong Ung expressed his pleasure at visiting Shiraz and said that the city is very famous in South Korea culturally and artistically and that many South Korean citizens are well aware of the historical background of this great city.
