TEHRAN – MP Javad Karimi Ghodoosi said on Sunday that President Hassan Rouhani has written a letter to Guardian Council chief Ayatollah Ahmad Janati calling for confirmation of four bills related to the Financial Action Task Force.
 Karimi Ghodoosi said that letter was written on June 23. It was said in the letter that approving the bills does not mean joining the FATF. Iran’s presidential chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi said on Wednesday that the Rouhani administration is not trying to join the FATF. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on June 20 that parliament should pass legislation to combat money laundering according to its own criteria. “As we have stated about some ‘international conventions recently raised in the Majlis,’ the Islamic Consultative Assembly, which is cultivated, matured and prudent, must make laws independently on issues such as combating terrorism or battling money-laundering,” the leader.ir quoted him as saying.
