TEHRAN – Like the Capital Tehran, Iran plans to construct biogas power plants in other big cities to generate electricity from wastewater, IRNA reported on Wednesday citing an official at Iran’s Water and Wastewater Company. According to the Director General of the Utilization Control Office at Iran’s Water and Wastewater Company, Bahman Vakili, one of the world’s biggest biogas power plants is operating at a wastewater treatment plant in southern Tehran. “Once fully operational, the power plant will generate about 80 gigawatts (GW) of electricity and 270 terajoules (TJ) of thermal energy annually, which is enough to supply a town with over 100,000 residents,” he said. “Tehran’s biogas power plant is currently generating 60 GW of electricity and 200 TJ of thermal energy, annually,” Vakili added.
