TEHRAN- Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has reaffirmed Tehran's resolve to deepen ties with Beijing in light of their “shared respect and interests.” Raisi made the comments in the message of congratulations to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on clinching a historic third term as president of China. “Accomplishing the objectives of comprehensive strategic partnership between Iran and China provides a model for the all-out expansion of relations based on mutual interests and respects,” the Iranian president remarked. He went on to add that “cooperating within the framework of organizations and multilateral entities, not only serves both countries' interests but also helps preserve international peace and stability.” The Communist Party of China selected Xi, a 69-year-old leader who came to power in 2012, as its general secretary on Sunday. China's Communist Party approved changes to its charter and endorsed Xi's core leadership as it wrapped up its week-long gathering at the National Congress in the country's capital Beijing. Around 2,300 delegates attended the event, which came to an end at the Great Hall of the People with the Communist Party of China securing a record third term as the nation's ruling party for another five years and unanimously passing a resolution on reforms.
