TEHRAN – Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) seeks to commercialize technological ideas associated with tourism by setting up a startup demo in Tehran on August 3. “We have decided to fulfill technology needs [in tourism sector] through indigenous approaches and methods and startups are the best option in this regard,” IRNA quoted Iman Mehdizadeh, the secretary of the event, as saying on June 25.  Recognizing the necessities for promoting tourism as well as introducing talented designers and innovators to investors in this field are amongst the main goals the event pursues, Mehdizadeh added. The startup demo will be organized under the auspices of the private sector and the Pardis Technology Park in close collaboration with the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization, Mehdizadeh explained, adding that 10 similar events are to be held in other cities in the near future. Following a landmark nuclear deal Tehran and world powers clinched in 2015, Iran is repeatedly named as a hot travel destination by a circle of international media outlets in terms of its rich history, picturesque sceneries, indigenous traditions, cuisine and hospitable people.
