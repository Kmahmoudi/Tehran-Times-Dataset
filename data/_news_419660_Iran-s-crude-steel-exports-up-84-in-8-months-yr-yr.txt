TEHRAN- Iran exported 4.225 million tons of crude steel during the first eight months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-November 21), showing 84 percent growth from 2.294 million tons in the same period of time in the preceding year, according to Iran Steel Association. The association’s report also said that the country exported 940,000 tons of steel products during the mentioned time, with 35 percent fall from 1.447 million tons in the same time span last year, Shata news agency reported on Sunday. Iran produced 14.149 million tons of crude steel during the first eight months of this year, indicating 15 percent increase from 12.311 million tons in the same period of time in the preceding year. The country’s crude steel exports are expected to reach a record high of 8 million tons by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2018). Head of the Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization (IMIDRO), Mehdi Karbasian, said in early November   that the country exported 3.5 million tons of crude steel during the first half of the current year. “Following this trend, the figure could most probably reach 8 million tons by year-end,” he added. The country aims to increase total crude steel output to 55 million tons and export between 20 and 25 million tons annually by the end of the 2025 Outlook Plan. As a major steel producer in the region, Iran has boosted steel production in recent years, as central Isfahan and southwestern Khuzestan provinces remain the major steel producers.
