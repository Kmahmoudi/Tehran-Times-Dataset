TEHRAN- A deputy from Iran Maritime and Port Organization (MPO) announced on Wednesday that port tariffs, regarding the rate of rial against dollar, are being calculated at domestic Forex Management Integrated System (locally known as NIMA), IRNA reported. “Regarding the amendments and reviews, each dollar is calculated about 80,000 rilas and in case the rate increases at NIMA, PMO will keep the rates fixed to support economic prosperity,” Mohammad-Ali Hassanzadeh said. NIMA is an online system designed for absorption of the non-oil exports revenues from Iranian businessmen and providing it to importers. In better words, exporters should bring back export revenues to economy and importers, via selling hard currency to a bank or an exchange shop through NIMA. As reported, about 95 percent of forex market exchanges are done at the system. Due to the large number of exchange deals, the forex rates are much lower at NIMA in comparison to the free market.
