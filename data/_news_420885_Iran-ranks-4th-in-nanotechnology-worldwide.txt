TEHRAN – According to Web of Science, Iran ranks fourth in nanotechnology in the world by publishing 8,791 articles in the field. As per the latest updates, Iran holds the fourth place above countries such as South Korea, Germany, Japan and France. China with the staggering number of 56,648 articles tops the list while the United States and India came in second and third places respectively. What is nanotechnology? Generally, nanotechnology is a field of research and innovation concerned with building 'things' - materials and devices - on the scale of nanometer - one-billionth of a meter. As Aznano describes, nanotechnology is hailed as having the potential to increase the efficiency of energy consumption, help clean the environment, and solve major health problems. It is said to be able to massively increase manufacturing production at significantly reduced costs. Nanotech advocates claim that products of nanotechnology will be smaller, cheaper, lighter yet more functional and require less energy and fewer raw materials to manufacture. Nanotechnology in Iran Iran’s first researches in this field started in 2000 and with publishing 9 articles, the country achieved the rank of 52 in that year. The national nanotechnology development headquarters was established in 2005, with the aim of making policies, assessing achievements in field of nanotechnologies, raising public awareness about nanoscience, improving quality of life and creating lucrative markets. Recognizing the great importance of nanotechnology, Iranians have had boosted researches in the field year on year. There are 257 companies active in this field, 33 percent of which working on nanomaterials, ISNA reported on Tuesday. These companies have manufactured 376 different products using the nontechnology, showing that this is a field with huge economic and practical advantages. The reports also demonstrate that these products are being exported to 47 different countries.
