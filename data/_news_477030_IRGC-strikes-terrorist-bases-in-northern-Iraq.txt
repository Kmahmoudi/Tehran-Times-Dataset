TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) on Saturday pounded terrorist bases in northern Iraq with artillery fire. The attack was conducted by ground forces of the IRGC. Units belonging to the Hamzeh Seyed al-Shohada base launched the operation to "destroy the positions of anti-Iran terrorist groups affiliated with global arrogance in northern Iraq who have in recent days trespassed on Iran's northwestern borders and attacked some border bases of our country," the IRGC said in a statement. It added that the IRGC security forces gave a decisive response to the terrorists' attacks after officials in northern Iraq refrained from taking an appropriate measure and paying due attention to numerous warnings given to them against the deployment and activity of anti-revolution mercenaries and terrorists against Iran, Press TV reported. The statement added that the operation would continue in order to "ensure sustainable border security and punish criminal terrorists" and hold officials in northern Iraq accountable towards fulfilling their legal duties in accordance with international regulations. Iran has numerously warned Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region that it will not tolerate the presence and activity of terrorist groups along its northwestern borders. Usually, terrorists, mostly allied to PJAK, commit vicious acts in west and northwestern Iran and then flee into northern Iraq.
