TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s “disgraceful” and “hypocritical” remarks are manifestations of the U.S. frustration.
 During an address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Sunday, Pompeo accused Iran of spreading violence across the Middle East.  Qassemi said, “The U.S. secretary of state’s disgraceful and hypocritical speech at this gathering was simply a propagandistic tool and showed the U.S. government’s frustration after its illegal exit from the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and failure to reach its objectives by taking this unilateral action and consequently isolated itself.” The Foreign Ministry says the Iranians will respond to the U.S. officials’ remarks and actions through unity.He added Pompeo’s remarks are a clear example of the U.S. interference in other countries’ affairs which are made in line with Washington’s “destabilizing” and “destructive” policies in the West Asia region. Qassemi said that the Iranians will never forget the U.S. behaviors including support for Saddam Hussein during his war against Iran in the 1980s. “The Iranians have never given in to the foreigners’ bullying policies and do not care about the policies of the U.S. president and the minority in the country who seek to wage war and are not committed to moral and human principles and whose words and behaviors lack any originality and cannot be trusted,” the Foreign Ministry spokesman stated. “Pompeo’s remarks show that he has no understanding about Iran’s past and present time”.He added that the Iranians will respond to the U.S. officials’ remarks and actions through unity. “The U.S. secretary of state’s remarks, especially the ones he made last night (Iran’s local time) show that he has no understanding about Iran’s past and present time. He should know that it is in the U.S. people’s interest to reach a deep understanding of other countries’ societies before judging them,” he said. Qassemi noted that the Iranian people will foil all the plots. NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
