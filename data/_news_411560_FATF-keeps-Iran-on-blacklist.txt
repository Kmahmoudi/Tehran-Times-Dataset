TEHRAN – The Financial Action Task Force has decided to keep Iran on its blacklist of high-risk countries for the time being.

 The FATF has said Iran will continue to stay on the blacklist as far as it has not fully implemented the Action Plan, Tasnim reported on Tuesday. The Action Plan is a set of measures designed for Iran to make its financial affairs transparent and verifiable. In June, the FATF promised to suspended counter-measures for 12 months in order to monitor Iran’s progress in implementing the Action Plan.   SP/PA
