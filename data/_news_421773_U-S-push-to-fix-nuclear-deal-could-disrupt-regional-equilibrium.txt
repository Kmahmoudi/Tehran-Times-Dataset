TEHRAN – Jean-Pierre Darnis, head of the Security and Defense Program at the Italian Institute of International Affairs (IAI), has said the U.S. administration’s push to “fix” the 2015 Iran nuclear deal could disrupt the regional balance of power. “Today's pushes to review the Iran nuclear deal could disrupt the fragile equilibrium and loosen the grip that a global power like the U.S. has on Saudi Arabia, opening the way for a regional escalation,” Darnis said, Tasnim reported on Sunday. He also said if the U.S. withdraws from the pact, it will open the door for a proliferation bounce in the region.
