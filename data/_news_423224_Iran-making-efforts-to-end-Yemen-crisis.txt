TEHRAN - Hossein Jaberi Ansari, the Iranian foreign minister’s special assistant in political affairs, said on Thursday that Iran is making efforts to help end the crisis in Yemen.
 “One of the objectives behind the Islamic Republic of Iran’s regional policies is making efforts to end this [Yemeni] crisis,” Jaberi Ansari told IRNA after a consultation meeting in Rome between Iran and EU/E4 on regional issues. “Developments in Yemen was the main theme of the meeting,” he noted. Jaberi Ansari added, “We had good discussions with the European representatives about various humanitarian, political and military dimensions of the Yemeni crisis.” According to a press release issued by the EU website, the meeting was chaired by EEAS Secretary General Helga Schmid and attended by E4 countries (France, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom) at the level of political directors. The Iranian delegation was led by Jaberi Ansari. “This is the second edition of talks in this format after the meeting in the margins of the Munich Security Conference in February 2018. The discussions, focused on the political and humanitarian situation in Yemen, were productive. The participants agreed to meet again in this format in Brussels in the near future,” the statement said.
