TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has strongly denounced a U.S. court ruling requiring Tehran to pay compensations to victims of the 9/11 attacks, saying the ruling was “politically-motivated”. “Such politically-motivated judgments which are based on unfounded accusations have already been raised in the past,” Qassemi was quoted by Fars as saying. “Not only is it a mockery of the international law system, but it is also a mockery at the expense of the American people, particularly the victims and the bereaved families of the September 11 attacks,” he added.
