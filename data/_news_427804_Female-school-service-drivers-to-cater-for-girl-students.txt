TEHRAN – A new law approved here on Tuesday by Tehran’s City Council gave priority to women drivers for girls’ school services. The law was approved by absolute vote of the council of 18 members for all primary and secondary schools, ISNA quoted Tehran city councilor Nahid Khodakarami as saying. Normally with the beginning of the school year (September 23) heavy, slow-moving traffic builds up in the street of Tehran, especially in early mornings when parents are trying to take their children to school and many want to go to work or university.  In order to address the issue and curb traffic congestion, governmental organizations give their employees the opportunity of a flexible working hour arrangement, so that instead of starting work at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. employees can attend work at 9 a.m. for the next two weeks.  NM/MQ/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
