TEHRAN — Ali Akbar Velayati, the secretary-general of the World Assembly on Islamic Awakening, on Monday expressed regret at the enormous damage caused by the U.S. military invasion of Afghanistan.  Addressing a virtual conference on Afghanistan hosted by the World Assembly of Islamic Awakening, Velayati warned that despite the shameful withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, the Americans were still maliciously trying to create divisions among Afghans. Velayati reiterated Iran’s commitment to supporting the Afghan nation on the path of peace, security, and development. He also commended the Afghan people for their courageous struggles with the Western and Eastern occupiers and invaders over the past decades. Afghans fought the invading Soviet Army in the 1980s, forcing the Kremlin to leave the country in disgrace. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the United States also invaded Afghanistan. The U.S. is also leaving the after 20 years shamefully.  Addressing the conference entitled “Afghanistan, Sustainable Peace, and Security”, the veteran politician noted that the United States occupied Afghanistan for 20 years by deploying thousands of soldiers and spending billions of dollars, resulting in severe damage and significant disasters in Afghanistan. Despite the initial delusion, the United States is humiliatingly withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, although it still tries to destroy what is left in Afghanistan, regretted Velayati who was Iran’s foreign minister from 1981 to 1997. The Iranian politician also warned that the United States is engaged in atrocious provocations to create discord among the noble people of Afghanistan. “However, the elite and educated individuals in Afghanistan are aware of their evil intentions and will thwart these conspiracies,” he pointed out. Velayati attributed the bloody wars between various ethnic groups in Afghanistan over the past 40 years to foreign provocations and called for vigilance to strengthen brotherhood between all parties that have lived in friendship and peace for thousands of years. On July 8 and 9, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs presided over a round of intra-Afghan negotiations. Representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban took part in the talks. The meeting was also attended by high-level figures supporting the Afghan republic. The two-day Afghan internal talks ended on July 9 with six statements. All parties participating in the meeting recognized the threat of a protracted war in Afghanistan and its damage to the country. In their statement, they also agreed that war is not the solution to the Afghan problem and called for collective efforts to achieve a peaceful and political solution. Delegations from the Afghan government and the Taliban said in a joint statement on Sunday that they will meet again and plan to expedite peace negotiations after two days of inconclusive talks in Doha, Al Jazeera has learned. The negotiators from the rival sides, who have been in Doha since Saturday, said, “The two sides committed to continue negotiations at a high level until a settlement is reached.”  SA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
