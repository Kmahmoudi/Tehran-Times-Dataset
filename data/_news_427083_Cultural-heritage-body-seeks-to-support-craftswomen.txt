TEHRAN – Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization has provided low-interest loans in a bid to support craftswomen who dominate the occupation.  “The loans will have an interest rate of 10 percent with six months of grace period,” CHTN quoted CHHTO deputy director Pouya Mahmoudian as saying on Friday.  “Females constitute 70% of the craftspeople and many of whom are breadwinners,” she stated.  Back in April, Masoumeh Ebtekar, vice president for women’s and family affairs, said the administration was following up on plans aiming to give women wider roles in tourism sector. Dozens of Iranian handicrafts have gained the UNESCO Seal of Excellence during the past couple of years.
