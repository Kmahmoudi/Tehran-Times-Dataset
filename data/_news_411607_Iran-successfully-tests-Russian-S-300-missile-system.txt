The Iranian Armed Forces have successfully tested the S-300 surface-to-air missile defense systems, which Iran imported from Russia after a decade long delay due to sanctions over its nuclear program. Iranian experts conducted a number of tests on the Russian missile systems during drills, which were held in the presence of several military and government officials in one of the country’s defense units. The tests included all phases of performance, namely detection, identification, interception and target shooting. The military exercise was carried out to analyze the performance of the S-300 system and to assess the capability of the system in engaging targets with a low radar cross sections and ballistic missile threats, as well as the ability of the Iranian military personnel to use the system. Reportedly, two targets, a ballistic missile and turbojet-powered drone designated 'Karrar', had been successfully identified, intercepted and taken down by the system. Confirming the news, Farzad Esmaili, commander of the Iranian army's air defense force, said “the S-300 system hit the ballistic missile.” The contract to deliver five Russian S-300 systems to Iran was signed in 2007, however due to the adoption of UN Security Council sanctions on Iran in 2010, which barred hi-tech weapons sales to the Islamic Republic, it was stalled. After the 2015 nuclear deal, Russia resumed the talks on the delivery of S-300, when Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted the ban on the delivery of the missile systems. Earlier this week, Iran’s Deputy Defense Minister Amir Khatami announced that Iran is also carrying out tests of its Bavar (Belief) 373 long-range air defense system. The Bavar 373 has similar characteristics to Russia’s S-300 system and was unveiled in August 2016. The project to build these missiles was launched in February 2010, after Russia suspended the $900 million deal signed in 2007. Tehran has since persevered with its plans to produce its own ground-to-air missile system. “Work with the Bavar 373 complexes is progressing as planned, testing of the complex has been carried out. These tests will continue to be carried out until the complexes are delivered to their units,” Khatami said in an interview with Tasnim news agency. Russia’s S-300 surface-to-air missile system has a range of up to 150 km and can hit targets at an altitude of up to 27.000 meters traveling at 2,800 meters per second. Its 92N6E multi-functional radar has a 400 km range, which is able to engage six targets simultaneously.
