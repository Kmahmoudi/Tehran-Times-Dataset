TEHRAN – The commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said on Wednesday that Iran does not recognize the Zionist regime as a threat anymore, warning “the smallest mistake they make will be their last one.” Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari said every new war in the region will be a step toward the "annihilation" of Israel from the face of the earth. The top general added that the fall of Daesh (ISIS), the failures of the Zionist regime and its reactionary Arab counterparts in the region are signs of the end of the hegemonic powers which are led by the U.S. MH/ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
