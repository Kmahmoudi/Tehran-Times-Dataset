TEHRAN – In a ceremony on Thursday, Hassan Rouhani is to receive his presidential precept from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The ceremony, which will be held at the Imam Khomeini Hussainia in Tehran, will be attended by the Parliament speaker, Judiciary chief and other senior military and governmental officials. Rouhani’s swearing-in ceremony will also be held on Saturday in Parliament, where high-profile delegations from around the world would attend the event. The oath of office will be administered by Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani. According to reports, the level of foreign dignitaries taking part in Rouhani’s inauguration would be “unprecedented”. Facing a strong challenge from principlist Ebrahim Raisi at the May 19 presidential election, Rouhani ultimately managed to secure more than 23 million (57%) of the votes, winning the election in a landslide. In the 2013 presidential election, when he ran for office for the first time, Rouhani promised to revive the economy and remove the nuclear sanctions. According to the Rouhani administration, all nuclear-related sanctions have been lifted after his foreign policy team, headed by Mohammad Javad Zarif, secured a historic nuclear agreement with six world powers.
