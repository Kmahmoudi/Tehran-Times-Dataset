 Iran’s current satellites are tentatively built to improve the country’s space technology, but two professional satellites will be launched in ten years, Mohammad Homayoun Sadr, deputy director of Iran Space Organization, told Mehr on Monday. The official said there are two special projects underway regarding the professional satellites, one being high-resolution imaging and the other being telecommunication services.  “This year (to end March 20), we will send one test satellite into space.
