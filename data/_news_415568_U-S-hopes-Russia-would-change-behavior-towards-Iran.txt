U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Sunday that he hopes new sanctions on Russia would prompt Moscow to change behavior towards some issues including supporting Iran.
 He said President Donald Trump and he remain very hopeful that they will see different behavior by the Russian government with regard to Ukraine and support for Iran and North Korea, Fox News reported. The White House confirmed on Friday the sanctions on Russia. In retaliation, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the U.S. would have to cut 755 diplomatic staff from Russia. The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate also approved a package of sanctions against Iran on Tuesday and Thursday respectively. The sanctions bill was passed by a 419-3 vote in the House and 97-2 in Senate. Sanctions were introduced against Iran for its missile program, alleged human rights abuses and what the U.S. claims Iran’s “destabilizing” role in the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has downplayed the new move by Congress. However, he said Iran will surely retaliate.
