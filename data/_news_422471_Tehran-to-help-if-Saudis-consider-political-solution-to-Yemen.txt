TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that Tehran is ready to offer any diplomatic assistance to help resolve the ongoing Yemeni crisis if Saudi Arabia considers a political solution.

 Speaking to BBC Arabic in an interview published on Sunday, Zarif said Iran would certainly support a political solution.  He added, “Any approach should be based on inter-Yemeni talks.” “We believed in the beginning that a political solution should be reached in Yemen. Long before the Yemeni crisis escalated we proposed to Saudi Arabia to help a political approach.” “The answer was that the affairs of the Arab world did not concern us…. It is a pity that Saudi Arabia and its allies always rejected a political solution and were hoping for victory in a military conflict,” the chief diplomat regretted. He added, “The current situation is the outcome of the wrong choices Saudi Arabia has made. We do not want to hurt our neighbors. We believe their security is ours. But we are not responsible for their wrong choices.” SP/PA
