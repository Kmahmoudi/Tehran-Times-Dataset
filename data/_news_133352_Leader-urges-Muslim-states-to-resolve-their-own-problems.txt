During the meeting, also attended by President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the geo-strategic position of the Islamic countries in the world and noted that Muslim states are duty-bound to make optimal use of their strength, i.e. their Islamic identity, and resolve the existing problems of the Islamic world. If Islamic nations should unite and realize their capabilities, thus they will feel empowered everywhere and can overcome all their problems, the Leader noted. Elsewhere in his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei underlined the significance of unity and cooperation between all Islamic countries, saying an insistence on the Islamic principles by Muslim nations will leave no space for interference by arrogant powers. He also appreciated the endeavors of the Gambian government for enforcing Islamic laws and regulations in the country, adding, “We have a brotherly view toward Africa.” Ayatollah Khamenei also expressed hope that bilateral relations between Iran and Gambia will be expanded. For his part, the Gambian president underlined the significant role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the international developments and noted that the “Islamic system of Iran strengthens Islam and Muslims in the world.”  He also said that his country was determined to develop relations with Iran.
