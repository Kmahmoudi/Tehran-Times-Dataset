TEHRAN – “Bolton is obsessed with Iran, and everything else plays second fiddle,” said one senior official from France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, pleaded unsuccessfully with Trump to remain in the Iran nuclear deal during an April visit to the White House, Reuters reported. In an article published on Thursday, Reuters reported that, “Bolton has had most success with Trump on Iran. He has played a central role in promoting the Trump administration’s efforts to create a security and political alliance with six (Persian) Gulf Arab states, Egypt and Jordan, in large part to help counter Iran’s expansion in the region.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
