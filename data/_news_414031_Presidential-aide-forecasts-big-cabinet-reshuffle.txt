TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani is likely to consider a big cabinet reshuffle in his second term, a presidential advisor said.

 Mohammad Ali Najafi told Tasnim on Tuesday that a change of about half to the current ministers is foreseeable. While some observers argue the president is likely to name more pro-reform ministers in the second term, Rouhani earlier pledged to appoint younger persons to ministerial posts compared to the current cabinet.
