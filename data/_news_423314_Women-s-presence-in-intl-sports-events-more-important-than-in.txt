TEHRAN – Presence of women in international sports fields is more important than their presence in stadiums, Masoumeh Ebtekar, vice president for women’s and family affairs, said here on Sunday. Women’s presence in international championships is essential and it requires serious support, the VP said noting Iranian women demonstrated a great presence in international sports fields. Currently, all sports federations enjoy a female deputy, she said, adding that in all sports fields the dress code should be adopted with Islamic dress code in order to provide the grounds for women’s presence in international sports fields.  Women’s presence in stadiums is understudy and the Ministry of Sports and Youths is following up the subject, said Ebtekar on the sideline of the first meeting of general managers of women and family affairs of different provinces. Some cultural modifications should be undertaken, including creating a women-only place at stadiums which has already been performed in many stadiums in different provinces and women are attending stadiums in many Iranian cities, she added. For the first time in history, Iran will send a female triathlete to the Asian Games. Shirin Gerami will represent Iran in the 2018 Asian Games in triathlon event. On 15 September 2013, Gerami raced the triathlon championship in London while garbed in full Islamic dress. Sareh Javanmardi from Iran claimed a gold medal at the 2018 World Shooting Para Sport Championships. Javanmardi defended her title in the P2 (women’s 10m air pistol SH1), as day three of the 2018 World Shooting Para Sport Championships finished on Sunday in Cheongju, South Korea.
