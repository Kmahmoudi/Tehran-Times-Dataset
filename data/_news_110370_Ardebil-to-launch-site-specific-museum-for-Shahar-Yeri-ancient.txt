“The ancient site, which has been excavated three times over the years, has achieved worldwide fame, and tourists will become familiarized with it after the establishment of the museum,” ACHTD director Masud Alavian Sadr said. Shahar Yeri is located near Pirazmeyan village, 32 kilometers from Meshkinshahr in Ardebil Province. The Iron Age site contains a castle, three temples, and a number of other architectural ruins. Archaeologists unearthed over 500 stone steles bearing images of faces of men and women with no mouths at the site during the third phase of excavations in early July 2005.
