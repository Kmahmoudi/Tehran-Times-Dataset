This creates a great opportunity for entrepreneurship by university students.”  For instance, there are already 450 technological companies working at the Sharif University of Technology, he said. “This does not mean that young entrepreneurs in other cities of Iran cannot be successful, there is a great capacity for startups and entrepreneurship in all parts of the country,” he added.
