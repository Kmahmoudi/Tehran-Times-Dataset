TEHRAN - Defense Minister Amir Hatami has said that Iran’s defense power “bears message of peace and friendship” and is in line with protecting security.
 In an interview with IRNA published on Sunday, he said, “Iran has succeeded to have a very favorable performance in defense products, and the Defense Ministry could achieve self-sufficiency in defense industry in spite of tough sanctions of the hegemonic system over the past 40 years.”  He noted that the Iranian armed forces’ deterrent capability and defense readiness have reached their “highest” level. Pointing to Iran’s missile capabilities, Hatami said that the country is now one of the major missile powers in the world. He also described the inauguration of the Kowsar fighter jet production line as a “valuable action” which proved inefficiency of sanctions. On November 3, Iran inaugurated production line of the homegrown supersonic Kowsar fighter jet. Kowsar is an advanced fighter jet with a close air support (CAS) role that has made Iran one of the few countries with the know-how of designing and manufacturing such jets equipped with 4th generation avionic and fire-control systems. Hatami said in the inauguration ceremony that production of Kowsar fighter jet is a symbol of fighting the hegemonic system and its excessive demands. He noted that production of the fighter jet was a big step in line with reducing effects of sanctions and boosting defense capabilities. The defense chief added that the country will manufacture more advanced generations of the warplane in the future. “Today, we proudly announce that we will spare no effort in defending the national security and values of the Islamic Revolution and protecting the country’s borders,” he said.
