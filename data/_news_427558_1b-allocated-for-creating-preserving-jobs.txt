TEHRAN- The Iranian government has prepared a protective plan worth one billion dollars aiming to create jobs, support the domestic production and preserve the existing jobs.   The government prepared a comprehensive plan to brace the country for the U.S.-led sanctions in late June, IRIB quoted head of the Budget and Planning Organization, Mohammad-Baqer Nobakht as saying. As he said, the plan also includes programs for regulating domestic markets within the framework of a package of proposals. On September 5, Nobakht said the government has prepared five new packages and 12 programs to tackle the current economic problems. Some 300 trillion rials (about $7.1 billion) has been allocated for implementing these strategic plans, Nobakht said. “Some 175 trillion rials (about $4.1 billion) of the sum is earmarked for supplying 25 different types of basic goods, medicine and agricultural inputs,” he added.
