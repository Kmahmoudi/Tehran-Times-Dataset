TEHRAN – Military parades and marches were held on Tuesday across Iran on the occasion of Army Day. The parades were attended by senior military officials. In the capital, Tehran, a ceremony was held near the mausoleum of the late founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Imam Khomeini.  Units from the four divisions of the Army took part in the parades, displaying their equipment.  A broad range of advanced gear such as missiles, tanks, armored vehicles, rifles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), fighter jets, radar systems, and air defense missile systems were put on display, said Tasnim. Over 40 various fighter jets, including Saeqeh (Thunderbolt), Kowsar, F-7, F-14, F-4, MiG-29, and Sukhoi fighter jets and bombers performed aerial maneuvers during the military parade over the capital, the news agency said. Delivering a speech before parading Army units in Tehran, President Ebrahim Raisi strongly warned Israel against any military action against Iran. He said in such a case Haifa and Tel Aviv will be destroyed.  “The enemies, especially the Zionist regime, have received this message that the slightest move against the country will evoke a severe response from the armed forces and will be accompanied by the destruction of Haifa and Tel Aviv,” Raisi asserted. The president also stressed that the Iranian military power definitely serves the interest of the region. He added the military parade sends the “message of peace and friendship” to regional countries. Elsewhere in his remarks, Raisi said Iran’s armed forces warmly welcome any country that seeks to protect security in the region. Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, the chief commander of the Army, also said that the forces under his command have started to employ state-of-the-art equipment and has long-term plans for boosting their capabilities.  Underlining that the Army should prepare itself to face any threat, Mousavi said, “The programs that have been prepared and approved in the Army with the help of young scientists have been prepared in the form of five-year plans, and the long-term plans of the armed forces for 20 years are also ready.” He pointed out that many issues such as strategies, tactics, and training are among the fundamental changes that have occurred in Iran’s armed forces. “If in the past we were an armed force that wanted to defend our borders with all our might, today we have full confidence that we can face any power that intends to commit aggression against this land and any power that imagines the balance of power to be upset. And if it commits aggression, we will deal with it,” he said, according to official news agency IRNA.  General Mohammad Bagheri, chairman of the chiefs of staff of the armed forces, and General Hossein Salami, the chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, issued separate messages on the occasion of Army Day.  General Bagheri said in his message that the Army played a key role in ensuring security of Iran and protecting its territorial integrity. ‘Anchor of the region's stability and security’  General Salami said in his message that the Army and the IRGC will continue to safeguard the Islamic Republic and disappoint the enemies.  In remarks to reporters on the sidelines of the military parade, General Salami said that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the anchor of the region's stability and security in any way and tries to use its defense power for peace and tranquility in the region. “We wish nothing but security and comfort for the countries of the region, and the message of this parade today was actually for the neighbors that we support the Muslim nations and will not leave them alone in difficult situations,” he said, according to IRNA. “Iran has always been in peace and tranquility with neighboring countries and its foundation is peace, comfort and security.” By Mehran Shamsuddin    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
