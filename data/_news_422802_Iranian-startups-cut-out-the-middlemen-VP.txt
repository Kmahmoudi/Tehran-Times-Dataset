TEHRAN – Startups make customers satisfied through offering services with reasonable prices by cutting out the middlemen, the vice president for science and technology has said. Sourena Sattari made the remarks during the opening ceremony of the 11th International Exhibition of Exchange, Bank and Insurance, visiting some startup companies on April 17. Sattari pointed to fast growth of startups in Iran due to warm welcoming of people for using services offered by them, ISNA reported on Wednesday.  “The rate of growth for some startups are 10 percent during a week,” he announced. He called the past Iranian calendar year 1396 (March 20, 2017-March 20, 2018) as a good year for startups, which saw great achievements in startup ecosystem. He said that startups provide transparent services to customers and this is the reason that people welcome startups. “This new system [of startups] should be supported by insurance and exchange, otherwise the country would be a looser,” he said. While middlemen resist the development of startups, people back innovative entrepreneurs, he said. “No one can fight with startups. We should support these great number of talented young people and accept their novel ideas,” he explained.
