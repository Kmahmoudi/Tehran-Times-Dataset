TEHRAN – Iranian and Spanish officials have agreed on deepening tourism cooperation by simplifying visa issuance regime and establishing direct flights between the two countries. The issue were raised in a meeting between Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization Director Zahra Ahmadipour and Spain’s Ambassador Eduardo López Busquets in Tehran, ISNA reported on Tuesday. Based on the agreement, Iran’s Mahan Air will commence non-stop flights between Tehran and Barcelona by June. Moreover, the same service linking Madrid to the Iranian capital will be established in the near future. “A visa simplification regime is the most important issue that should be taken into account as it would pave the way for broadening tourism ties,” Ahmadipour said. López Busquets for his part expressed hope that the visa-issuing capacity for Iranian travelers would be doubled. “Over twenty thousand Iranians visited Spain in 2016,” he added. “Launching direct flights would greatly help facilitate exchanging tourists between the two countries,” the envoy added. The officials also touched upon other subjects, amongst them were organizing exhibits on tourism and handicrafts, conservation of historical sites and relics, and sharing knowledge for improving tourism infrastructures. In January, a total of 19 Iranian tourism-associated businesses showcased vast patchwork of handicrafts, traditions and tourism potentials of the country at the 37th FITUR tourism trade fair in Madrid.
