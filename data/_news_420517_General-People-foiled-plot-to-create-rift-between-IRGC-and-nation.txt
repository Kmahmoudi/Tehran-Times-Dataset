TEHRAN – IRGC spokesman Brigadier General Ramazan Sharif on Saturday lauded the Iranian nation for foiling a plot by the enemy to drive a wedge between the nation and the IRGC. The enemy’s failure to foment discord between the Iranian nation and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps was owed to the nation’s cleverness and efforts by media, Sharif was quoted by ISNA as saying. He further praised the country’s media outlets, saying the national media, especially the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), defended the IRGC from the hegemonic powers’ propaganda and slanders.
