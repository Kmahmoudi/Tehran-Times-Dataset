TEHRAN – The Iranian city of Mashhad and the Iraqi city of Karbala will host the first edition of the Path of Love International Festival of Film and Photo on Imam Reza (AS), the eighth Imam of the Shia Muslims, and the Arbaeen rituals in October. The festival will be running from October 23 to 27, the organizers announced on Wednesday. Interested applicants can submit their works in different fields such as features, short films, documentaries, screenplays, TV series and photos to www.masireeshgh.com.  Mashhad is the Capital of Islamic Culture for 2017 as well as home to the holy shrine of Imam Reza (AS), and 
Karbala is home to the holy shrine of Imam Hussein (AS).   A large number of pilgrims head to Karbala during Arbaeen, which marks the end of the 40-day mourning period following the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (AS) and his companions on Ashura, the 10th of Muharram when Imam Hussein (AS) and his companions were martyred. The festival will provide a facility for the artists to help create works, which promote the ritual and the culture of sacrifice.
