TEHRAN – The UNESCO-listed historical city of Yazd has launched a pilot project that could eventually turn it to the first “City of Tourists” in Iran, becoming a role model for other most-visited cities across the country. “The results of the arrangements that are being carried out in Yazd to transform the city into a ‘City of Tourists’ will be generalized to be applied in other tourist cities in the country,” CHTN quoted Fatemeh Daneshyazdi, the director of Yazd province’s tourism department, as saying on Sunday.  The scheme of “City of Tourists” was invented after Yazd was made a UNESCO World Heritage in June. The notion has been supported by Yazd Municipality and the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization to buttress hospitality and transportation infrastructure in the ancient city. The oasis city of Yazd is wedged between the northern Dasht-e Kavir and southern Dasht-e Lut on a flat plain ringed by mountains. Its historical structure enjoys a very harmonious public-religious architecture that dates from different eras. With its winding lanes, forest of badgirs (wind catchers), mud-brick houses, atmospheric alleyways and centuries of history, Yazd is a delightful place to stay, referring as a ‘don't miss’ destination by almost all travel associates in the region. The city has an interesting mix of people as well, some 10 percent of whom follow the ancient religion of Zoroastrianism.
