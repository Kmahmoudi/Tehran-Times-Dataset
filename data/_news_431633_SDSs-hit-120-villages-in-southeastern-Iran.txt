TEHRAN – Intense sand and dust storms (SDSs) left 120 villages surrounded by sandy soil in Rigan county located in the southeastern province of Kerman, the region’s governor, Amin Baqeri, said on Monday. Particulate Matter (PM) concentration peaking above the safe levels along with severe SDSs has caused respiratory problems for the residents, as well as blocking roads linking the villages, Baqeri stated. He went on to say that the forces of the Road Maintenance Organization are standing guard to provide services in emergency condition. The Red Crescent Society forces have been dispatched to offer services to the residents, who have rescued some 16 vehicles being stuck in the soils, he noted. In August 2018, Baqeri announced that PM concentration peaking at 12 times the safe levels, led to the closure of offices in Rigan county. After southwestern province of Khuzestan, Rigan county is the second region in the country being severely haunted by the intensity of PM concentration, leaving 16 villages depopulated.
