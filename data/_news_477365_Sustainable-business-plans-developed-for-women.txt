TEHRAN – The Vice Presidency for Women and Family Affairs has developed plans to create sustainable family-oriented businesses in 15 provinces, IRNA reported on Saturday. Implementing different projects for creating a sustainable business can definitely be very effective for empowering women in the country, Ensieh Khazali, Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, said. The plans to create family-oriented sustainable businesses have been developed and are currently being implemented in 15 provinces, she stated. Skill training, support, and creation of employment opportunities for women are among our goals and plans, and with the implementation of the sustainable job plans, the employment of women will be provided for at least five years, she added.

The national plan of the family-oriented sustainable business network and the conclusion of 12 agreements for the economic empowerment of women heads of the household are also among other operational plans that will play a serious role in improving the business situation of women, she noted.

It has been prepared in four sections consultation, education, employment, and support, and has been sent to the cultural and social commissions of the government. The creation of a loan guarantee fund for female heads of households is another effective and important measure. With the formation of this fund, the problem of many female heads of households who did not have a guarantor to receive loans is solved, she said. She went on to say that formation of a loan guarantee fund for women heads of households, launching an empowerment plan for women breadwinners, improving the structure and position of women in provinces, carrying out women’s sustainable business plans, boosting women's employment, and setting up a market platform was among the measures to introduce new businesses of young people and women.

According to the Statistical Center of Iran, out of twenty-two (22) million families in Iran, over three (3) million are WHH and most of them are in less-developed areas. The Government prioritized such families for targeting socio-economic support. FB/MG   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
