TEHRAN- Some 12.565 million tons of oil and non-oil products were loaded and unloaded at ports of Iran during the third Iranian calendar month of Khordad (May 21-June 20), registering 15.1 percent rise compared to the same month in the preceding year, IRNA reported on Saturday.  From the mentioned total amount of loaded and unloaded goods in Khordad, the share of non-oil products stands at 8.16 million tons, while that of oil products hovers around 4.405 million tons. As Press TV reported in late March, documenting the data released by the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration, Iran witnessed an ‘unprecedented’ surplus in its foreign trade over the past Iranian calendar year (ended March 19, 2016). The customs figures revealed that the country registered a trade surplus of $0.916 billion in the 12-month period ending on March 19, 2016. Iran’s balance of trade turned positive with its exports tallying $42.415 billion, compared with $41.499 billion worth of imports. Gas condensate, oil and petrochemical products constituted the major part of Iranian exports, while maize for cattle feed, wheat and rice were among the chief imports, the report added. China, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Afghanistan and India purchased more Iranian goods than other countries last year, while a fair share of Iranian imports came from China, the UAE and South Korea.
