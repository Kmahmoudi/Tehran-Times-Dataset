TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday that Iran does not recognize a recent UN report on the situation of human rights in Iran, saying it has been drafted based on “wrong information”.
 “The content of this report on the situation of human rights in Iran is based on wrong information and prejudice which has been prepared by invalid sources,” he said. UN special rapporteur Asma Jahangir voiced concern on Thursday about alleged hunger strike by prisoners in Iran “protesting against their conditions of detention and abrupt transfer to a high-security section.” Qassemi said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply believes that the report prepared by the rapporteur and her mission are based on a resolution which adopts politically motivated and selective approaches. Iran does not recognize this report and rejects it as unacceptable.” Qassemi noted that the UN special rapporteur ignores advances that Iran has made in the area of human rights. Jahangir has made efforts to portray a “dark” and “unilateral” image of the human rights situation in Iran by using “vague” phrases and expressing concerns based on “unreliable” information, the Foreign Ministry official stated. “The principle of impartiality and professional work of the rapporteur has definitely been undermined,” he added. Qassemi also said that adoption of “political” and “selective” approaches in the area of human rights by some countries will just weakens the status of human rights. Elsewhere, he criticized ignorance toward violation of human rights in Yemen, Bahrain and Myanmar.
