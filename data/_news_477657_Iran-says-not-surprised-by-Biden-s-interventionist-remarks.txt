TEHRAN — Responding to the interventionist remarks made by U.S. President Joe Biden about the recent developments unfolding in Iran, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry has said that Tehran is not surprised by meddlesome remarks of the U.S. politicians.  Writing on his Instagram page on Sunday, Nasser Kanaani said, “Since the beginning of the recent developments in Iran, yesterday, U.S. President Joe Biden supported the disturbances in Iran for the umpteenth time through interventionist statements.” “Because he has neither trusted advisers nor a good memory, I remind him that Iran was too strong and stable to surrender to your cruel sanctions and absurd threats,” the diplomat continued. He then noted that even now, Iran is too proud to be “swayed by the interventions and exclamations of a politician tired of years of fruitless action against Iran.” Kanani emphasized, “Neither Biden's statements nor America's interventionism will ever surprise us, because intervention, aggression and killing are the true nature of the American system, but we are historical people and we are deeply rooted in history. From the (American-led) coup in August 1953 until today, the anti-Iranian policies of the American government have been well recorded in our minds. And of course, the history, as well as all over the world testify that the wound of America's crime and violence is on the world’s body.” The diplomat went on to note that the U.S. has grown accustomed to misusing opportunities. “Your habit is to catch fish from muddy waters (a Persian idiom that is defined as opportunism). But remember, this is Iran. The land of proud men and women. In our home, we talk to each other, we work together, and together, we will try to heal Iran's big and small wounds. Together, we will stand for Iran's independence, and of course, another failure will be added to the pile of your failures,” the spokesman concluded.
