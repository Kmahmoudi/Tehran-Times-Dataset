TEHRAN- Delivering speech at a ceremony in Tehran to remember security martyrs on Thursday afternoon, President Ebrahim Raisi said the enemies assaulted the Iranian people in the recent turmoil in the same way that Daesh did, revealing their animosity with the Islamic Revolution. Mahsa Amini, 22, who died on September 13 from a sudden heart attack at a Tehran police station, served as the catalyst for the unrest. Noting that today security in cities is owed to the “blood” of those dear youths who lost their lives in the face of rioters, he said, “Even though the grief of losing them is very hard for us, their pure blood disappointed the enemy.”  In response to requests from the families of security personnel, Raisi declared the responsible bodies will work “decisively to identify, try, and punish” those murderers. Iran’s president also emphasized that the enemy's media imperialism only distorts the truth by concocting narratives and spreading misinformation. Raisi also pointed to the opponents' hypocrisy about human rights, saying while on one side they chant slogans in support of "the right to life," they dispatched armed assassins to Shiraz to murder a 10-year-old boy and his parents in the Shah Cheragh Shrine. The president stated that the adversaries attempted to destroy Iranian ideals by launching a hybrid war, but the Iranian population stood up to them and foiled their ploys.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
