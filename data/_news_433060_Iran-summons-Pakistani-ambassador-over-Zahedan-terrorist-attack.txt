TEHRAN – On Sunday, the Foreign Ministry summoned Riffat Masood, the Pakistani ambassador to Tehran, over a deadly terrorist attack in southeast Iran.
 “During this meeting, increase in terrorist moves from inside Pakistan, including the recent terrorist incident on Zahedan-Khash road, was mentioned and our country’s complaint was announced. It was clearly stressed that the Islamic Republic of Iran expects the Pakistani government and army to take serious actions against the terrorist groups’ headquarters in border areas with Iran,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. Qassemi said the Pakistani government and people should not let the terrorist groups cause distrust between the two countries through taking “terrorist” and “inhuman” actions. He also urged the Pakistani government to identify and arrest perpetrators of the terrorist attack. In a suicide attack on a bus carrying IRGC personnel on Zahedan-Khash road in the border province of Sistan-Baluchestan late on Wednesday, 27 soldiers were killed and 13 other injured. The terrorists usually use Pakistan’s soil as a safe haven for their actions inside Iran.
