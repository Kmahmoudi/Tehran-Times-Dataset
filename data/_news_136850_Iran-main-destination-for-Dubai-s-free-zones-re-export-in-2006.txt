Figures released last week show that the total value of non-oil trade that passed through the free zones last year amounted to Dh193.6 billion, compared to Dh177.8 billion in 2005. China topped the list of exporters to Dubai's various free zones, sending goods worth Dh18 billion, followed by Japan, the U.S., Finland and Germany. Imports through the free zones recorded the highest growth, increasing by 12 percent from Dh99 billion in 2005 to Dh111 billion in 2006. Exports grew by only five percent, from Dh78.7 billion in 2005 to Dh82.6 billion in 2006. The number of companies operating in the emirate's eight free zones has risen steadily over the last few years, but all failed to rival Jebel Ali Free Zone, which still handles the majority of non-oil foreign trade. It accounted for Dh136 billion, with Dh79 billion in imports and Dh57.6 billion in exports. (www.gulfnews.com)
