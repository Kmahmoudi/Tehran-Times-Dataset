TEHRAN â€“ Iran's defense minister has highlighted the importance of developing cooperation between Iran and Belarus in the region and the larger world. Brigadier General Amir Hatami made the remarks in a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart in Moscow on Tuesday, IRIB news reported. Hatami, who has visited Russia to take part in the International Security Conference, said foreign plans for bolstering security in the Middle East will inevitably fail. He suggested any plan for this purpose must originate from within the region. Such plans are not compatible with the interests of the regional countries, he added.
