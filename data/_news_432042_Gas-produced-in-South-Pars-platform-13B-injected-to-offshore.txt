TEHRAN- Gas produced in platform 13B of Iran’s South Par gas field was injected to the offshore refinery of phase 13 of the gas field development, Payam Motamed, the operator of this phase, announced. He said the gas received from this platform was injected to the fourth train of sweetening refinery of phase 13 on Thursday, Public Relations Department of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), which is in charge of developing the gas field, reported. This train of the refinery was put into operation one month ago. In a press conference last month, POGC Managing Director Mohammad Meshkinfam put the current refining capacity of South Pars refineries at 2 billion cubic feet per day. Phase 13 is aimed at production of 56 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas, 75,000 barrels of gas condensate and 400 tons of sulfur per day in addition to one million tons of ethane and one million tons of propane and butane per annum. South Pars is divided into 24 standard phases of development in the first stage. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment. Meshkinfam also announced that all development phases of the gas field, except for phase 11, will be completed by the end of the next Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2020). The huge offshore field, shared with Qatar, covers an area of 9,700 square kilometers, 3,700 square kilometers of which, called South Pars, are in Iran’s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf. The remaining 6,000 square kilometers, called North Dome, are situated in Qatar’s territorial waters. The field is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate.
