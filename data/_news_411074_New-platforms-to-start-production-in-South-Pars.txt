TEHRAN- Production will begin in six new platforms of Iran’s South Pars gas field (in the Persian Gulf) during the next Iranian calendar year (which begins on March 22, 2017), Shana quoted Mohammad Meshkinfam, the managing director of Pars Oil and Gas company (POGC), as saying. The official said that by putting these six platforms into operation South Pars daily gas output will reach 600 million cubic meters.
