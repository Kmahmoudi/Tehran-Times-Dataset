TEHRAN — Ehsan-Barekat Charity Foundation has provided some 3,000 wheelchairs to people with disabilities in underprivileged areas, director of Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order said on Sunday. 
 Following a campaign launched by the charity called Charkh-e Zendegi (literally meaning the wheel of life) public have started making generous donations, so that 3,000 wheelchairs are bought and dispatched to deprived provinces, Mehr news agency quoted Mohammad Mokhber as saying.  There are 450,000 physically challenged people living in Iran and some are living in financial distress and can barely afford to have wheelchairs and may even are trapped at homes not having wheelchairs, Mokhber regretted.
