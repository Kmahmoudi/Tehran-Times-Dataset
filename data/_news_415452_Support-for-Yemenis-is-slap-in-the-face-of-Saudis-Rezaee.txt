TEHRAN - Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezaee said on Friday that backing the Yemeni people is a “humanitarian” act and a slap in the face of Saudis.
 In Ahl Al-Bayt World Assembly’s meeting, he said that Saudi Arabia’s attack on Yemen is not legitimate. Iranians are highly motivated to help Yemenis due to their hatred towards the Saudi regime, he said.  Saudi Arabia has been leading the campaign against Yemen since 2015. Local Yemeni sources have put the death toll from the Saudi war at over 12,000, including many women and children. NA/PA
