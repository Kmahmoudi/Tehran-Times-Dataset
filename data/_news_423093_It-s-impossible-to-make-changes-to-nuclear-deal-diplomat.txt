TEHRAN – Iranian Ambassador to France Abolghassem Delfi has said that it is impossible to make changes to the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 “It is not possible to add anything to the JCPOA or remove anything from it. The agreement should be preserved,” Mehr news agency quoted him as saying in an interview with CNews on Saturday. In a statement on January 12, U.S. President Donald Trump gave Europeans only 120 days to agree to an overhaul of the nuclear agreement and said if the text of the deal is not revised he would unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from it. The deadline falls on May 12. “It is not important that one of the signatories pulls out of the deal. It is important for us that Europe remains in this agreement,” Ambassador Delfi noted. He added that the European corporations are afraid of investing in Iran because of the U.S. threats. “It should be said that the U.S. has not fulfilled its obligations since the deal was signed,” he said. Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the U.S., UK, France, Russia, and China - Germany and the European Union struck the nuclear deal in July 2015. The deal took effect in January 2016. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
