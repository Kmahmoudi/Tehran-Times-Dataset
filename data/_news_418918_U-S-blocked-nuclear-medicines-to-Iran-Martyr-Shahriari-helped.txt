They wanted to do something to prevent radio-pharmaceuticals from reaching the people's hands. They wanted to create problems for the Islamic Republic. They used to say, "We will not sell these radio-pharmaceuticals". This was done with the purpose of closing our center in Tehran, but people like martyr Shahriari worked on it in a diligent way. The enemy was astonished. Another personality was martyr Shahriari. These days, we are mentioning his name because it is his martyrdom anniversary. The rest are the same: Rezainejad, Ali Mohammadi and Ahmadi Roshan. These were our outstanding personalities in the area of knowledge and research. They used to work in a basiji manner. Martyr Shahriari used to work in a devoted manner as well. In those days, they wanted to close the gates to the people of Iran with the methods that many of the people saw on TV and heard in the news. Many of these methods were adopted behind the scenes. In the future, it will come clear how malevolent they were. They wanted to do something to prevent radiopharmaceuticals from reaching the people's hands. They wanted to create problems for the Islamic Republic. They used to say, "We will not sell these radiopharmaceuticals". This was done with the purpose of closing our center in Tehran, but people like martyr Shahriari worked on it in a diligent way. Then, they came to us and said, "We have managed to produce 20 percent". After that, they informed us that they had built fuel rods and fuel plates. The enemy was astonished. This was the work of basijis and it was not an ordinary piece of work. In all the arenas that we pointed out, there were and still are great individuals. They have made great efforts some of which we mentioned. Nov 27, 2014 
The same is true of science. If a country enjoys scientists who are interested in the destiny of their country and are prepared to make sacrifices on this path, that country will make progress. Religious faith is the best thing that can give rise to this driving force and this progress. If a country enjoys this faith, it will make progress. The inherent value of the scientific advances that we have made in the country - and definitely we are not satisfied with these advances - is far more than the conventional scientific advances in the world. Why? Because we were deprived of scientific exchanges and the assistance of others. We were under pressure and the doors had been closed to us. However, we have had tens of outstanding personalities like martyr Shahriari. Tens and hundreds of people were trained in different areas and they accomplished outstanding achievements. And they did not at all benefit from western universities, research centers and professors. Of course they definitely made use of western achievements and this is what we should do.
