TEHRAN – Mohammad Hashemi, a university professor, has said that the term “statesman” has nothing to do with gender, noting women can also participate in political activities.
 The term statesman includes both men and women, ILNA reported Hashemi as saying on Monday. His comments came as speculations have surged over possible candidacy of Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi in the next presidential election which will be held on May 19. Vahid-Dastjerdi was the Islamic Republic’s first and only female minister, who headed the Ministry of Health and Medical Education between 2009 and 2012. Under Iran’s law, the Guardian Council, a body of jurists and clerics, vets all candidates before any elections. It has rejected candidacy of women for presidency up until now. However, last month, the council indicated that it might alter a masculine definition of “statesman” so that women could run for presidency for the first time. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, the council’s spokesman, said last month that women could run in the upcoming presidential election, but whether they would be approved by the council is still in debate. NA/PA
