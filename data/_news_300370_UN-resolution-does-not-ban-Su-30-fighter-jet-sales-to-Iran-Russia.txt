TEHRAN – Russia has rejected a U.S. claim that the sales of Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets to Iran were prohibited under a United Nation Security Council resolution.
 Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Department for Non-Proliferation and Arms Control, Mikhail Ulyanov, dismissed U.S. Department of State Undersecretary for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon’s claims that Washington would use its veto power in the Security Council to block the possible sales of the fighter jets to Iran, Press TV reported on Wednesday. “Such deliveries are not prohibited, they are allowed, and this follows from the text of the resolution,” the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.  SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
