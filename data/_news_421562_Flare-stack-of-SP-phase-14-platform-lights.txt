TEHRAN- Flare stack of the first platform of Iran’s South Pars gas field’s phase 14 of development was lighted on Saturday. The 2,500-ton platform 14A, which is the main platform of phase 14, was installed on its designated offshore spot on January 24, according to the Public Relations Department of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), which is in charge of developing South Pars. Phase 14 is expected to produce 56.6 million cubic meters of sour gas and 75,000 billion barrels of gas condensate per day, one million tons of liquefied gas and one million tons of ethane per year, and 400 tons a day of sulfur. South Pars, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate. The field is divided into 24 standard phases of development in the first stage. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment.
