TEHRAN - Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Thursday that Iran is prepared to take action in line with swapping prisoners with the U.S.
 Mousavi said the Foreign Ministry is prepared to free American prisoners who have been jailed by the Iranian Judiciary in exchange for release of the Iranians who have been jailed in the U.S. on “delusional” charges of violating sanctions. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said during an interview in New York on Wednesday that Iran is ready to swap prisoners with the U.S. “I put this offer on the table publicly now. [Let’s] Exchange them”, Zarif said. "If they tell you anything else, they are lying," he added. Mousavi said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s proposal is clear and needs no interpretation if the U.S. regime has the will.” According to Press TV, Mousavi said, “What the Iranian foreign minister raised in New York just concerns Iranian prisoners in the U.S. or those arrested in other countries at Washington’s request with a number of American criminals in Iran.” He made the remarks in reaction to UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who had assumed Zarif’s suggestion of a prisoner swap also includes Iranian-British dual citizen, Nazanin Zaghari, who is jailed in Tehran for espionage. In his interview on Wednesday, Zarif just said she feels sorry for Nazanin Zaghari and her child and that he has done his “best to help” her.  NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
