TEHRAN- Danish police have confirmed in a statement that a knife-wielding person who attacked the Iranian embassy in Copenhagen on Friday was to stand trial on Saturday. Police said a 32-year-old man with a knife had been detained for trespassing against the building and assaulting a staff member there. The invader was imprisoned pending his trial due to a request filed by Denmark's prosecutor general. According to the police statement, the intruder has been charged with two criminal offenses: violating Danish criminal regulations and making violent actions. In accordance with the police statement, following the incident, necessary security measures were put in place surrounding the Iranian embassy and for its staff, in coordination with the Danish Intelligence Service, which is now looking into the incident's scope. The Friday incident's most recent status was previously discussed over the phone with Iran's ambassador to Denmark by Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian. “After entering the embassy premises, the intruder who was armed with a cold weapon (knife) began threatening, making horror, and then inflicted damages to the parked cars in the embassy parking lot,” Ambassador Afsaneh Nadipur informed the Foreign Ministry. She continued by saying that despite prior formal warnings from the embassy, police arrived at the crime site after a very long delay. During the conversation, Amir Abdollahian reiterated that it is regrettable that a female ambassador with diplomatic immunity has been subjected to such an intrusion and that the police were also slow to arrive.  She expressed strong objection to lack of the necessary security measures for the ambassador and her embassy in Copenhagen.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
