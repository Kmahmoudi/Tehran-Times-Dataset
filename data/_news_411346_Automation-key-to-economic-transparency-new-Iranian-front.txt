Exclusive – Iran’s economy will grow more transparent if more “automation” is encouraged instead of red tape, a spokesman with Popular Front of the Islamic Party highlighted on Tuesday. “For more transparency, we need to move towards automation,” Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi told the Tehran Times.
“Wherever we do things manually, we face problems.” According to International Transparency, Iran ranks 131 among 176 countries in terms of corruption and transparency. There is pressing need for the country to introduce measures for a more transparent economy, particularly now that the country is emerging from years of economic sanctions in the wake of a 2015 international nuclear deal with six world powers.   Economy has been a running theme in announcements made by the front, which declared its existence late December. She, however, sidestepped the question if the front had any detailed plan to implement the automation agenda. Health minister under the Ahmadinejad administration, Vahid-Dastjerdi helped establish an automation system within the ministry, outperforming other ministries in this regard. There is popular demand for transparent economic performance in the Iranian community. Back in May 2016, pay slips of top managers at a state insurance company were leaked to Iranian media.
  
In the weeks that followed more pay slips mysteriously found their way into the public domain, revealing the earnings of a range of officials from top civil servants to bank bosses. AK/PA
