Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said on Saturday that the 2015 nuclear deal should remain inviolable as the basis for further contacts on the Iranian nuclear program.
 “What is the main thing is the inviolability of this deal; otherwise, there will be no platform for continuing contacts and for continuing the dialogue,” TASS quoted Peskov as saying. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Moscow and Beijing would try to block any U.S. attempt to sabotage the nuclear deal  NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
