TEHRAN – An Italian version of “Homay and Homayun”, a collection of 4435 couplets of love and adventure from medieval Persia by Persian poet and mystic Khwaju Kermani (1290-1349), has recently been released in Italy.
  Translated into Italian by Nahid Noruzi, an Iranian lecturer and a professor of Persian at the University of Bologna, the book was published by Mimesis Publications in October 2016. Professor Johann Christoph Buergel, former Director of Islamic Studies at the University of Bern, has written the introduction of the book. The book has also highlighted the position of the poet in Persian literature. Khwaju Kermani was born in Kerman and died in Shiraz, where his tomb is still in situ at the Quran Gate near the Allaho-Akbar Pass.
