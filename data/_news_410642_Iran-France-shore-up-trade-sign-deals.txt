Underlining the positive impact of Iran’s sanctions’ removal on enhancement of Frances ties in the past year with Iran, Ayrault voiced his country’s readiness to transfer knowledge and provide technical and engineering services for Iran’s renewable energy sector, and implement various projects including those in railway transportation and those for expansion of ports in the Islamic Republic. Iran-France business forum is a turning point in the two countries’ economic relations, he asserted. Bolstering bilateral trade The Iranian foreign minister, for his part, vowed that his ministry will pave the way for development of bilateral ties between Iran and France, adding that Iran-France bilateral trade stood at €1.7 billion during January-November 2016, becoming three-folded, compared to the same period in 2015.  He, however, did not express content about the current trade volume saying that it does not accord with the two countries’ potentials. Removal of banking barriers  As ICCIMA head said, both sides believe in removing impediments on development of mutual banking ties as the most significant factor in improvement of Iran-France trade bonds. “Iranian and French companies can cooperate in various sectors namely infrastructure, construction, medicine, medical instruments, transportation, environment, etc,” he added.  HJ/MA/MG
