TEHRAN – A Russian diplomatic source has said that Russia is working closely with Iran, Turkey and the UN to urgently restore the vital water supply to Damascus after it was cut off last month. “Russian diplomats raised the issue with the UN on Thursday, saying some 5.5 million of people in Damascus were on the verge of humanitarian crisis due to what radicals did in the Damascus suburb of Wadi Barada,” the informed source told Sputnik on Friday. Water supplies from Wadi Barada and Ain al-Fija springs in northwest of Damascus which serve 70 percent of the city’s population were cut off late December. “This problem needs to be urgently resolved to restore water supply to Damascus. Russia is closely working with Turkey, Iran and the UN,” the Russian source added. The UN warned weeks ago that four million people in Damascus have been deprived of safe drinking water supplies after springs outside the city were targeted. UN’s Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura has warned that the issue could be crucial for the upcoming Syrian talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, which will be held on January 23. MH/PA
