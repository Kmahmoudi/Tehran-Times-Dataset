TEHRAN- The highest-ranking military official has said claims that Iranian drones have been deployed in the conflict in Ukraine are a kind of "psychological warfare" by the adversaries. Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, the Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, told reporters on the sidelines of a cultural event in Tehran on Sunday that all the hue and cry regarding the deployment of Iranian drones in the conflict in Ukraine by the "world of arrogance" is "part of the enemy's psychological warfare". Aside from the fact that many of those allegations are fake, the general noted that they demonstrate Iran's significant influence, relevance, and its advanced drone technology. Major General Bagheri described Iran as one of the world's top five drone powers, saying Iranian UAVs can carry out a wide range of operations with great precision and flying endurance. Referring to the acknowledgment of ex-commander of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) who had said “U.S. air superiority has ended for the first time since the Second World War because Americans cannot project aerial power where there are Iranian drones,” General Bagheri underscored that “this is big and humiliating confession by the Americans.” He added, “It is true that they no longer possess such aerial dominance.” The senior general highlighted that Iran will plow ahead with plans to enhance its drone capabilities, stating, “In accordance with the issues and rules of the Islamic Republic, we will work with other nations in the drone industry.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
