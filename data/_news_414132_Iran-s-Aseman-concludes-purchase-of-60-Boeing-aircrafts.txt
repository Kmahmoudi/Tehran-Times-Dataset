TEHRAN- Iran’s Aseman Airlines sealed a deal in Tehran on Saturday with the American manufacturer Boeing on purchasing 60 aircrafts. As per the deal, Aseman is going to receive 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircrafts as of 2022 over the course of two years, ISNA reported.  The deal would also provide the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional 737 MAXs, the report added. In early April, Aseman said it had signed an agreement with Boeing on the purchase of 30 planes model 737 MAX worth $3 billion.  Shortly after Iran’s nuclear deal with the world major powers in January 2016, the country inked an $18 billion deal with France-based Airbus for 46 Airbus A320 planes, 38 A330 planes and 16 A350 XWB aircraft. It was finalized last December. That same month, state-owned Iran Air signed a $16.6 billion agreement to purchase 80 new Boeing 777 and 737 passenger planes, to be delivered over a period of 10 years.
