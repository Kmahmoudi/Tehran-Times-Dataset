TEHRAN – On Sunday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry strongly condemned “horrible” and “shameful” terrorist blasts in Damascus, Syria, which left 74 people killed. “The terrorists and their overt and covert supporters are well aware of the fact that they are on the verge of total annihilation in the military battle; so, they seek to prevent establishment of peace and stability in Syria,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. Twin bombings targeting Shia pilgrims in Damascus on Saturday left 74 people dead. Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said on Sunday that a roadside bomb detonated as a bus carrying pilgrims made its way through the Bab al-Saghir area of the Old City before a suicide bomber blew himself up. In a statement, Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Jamal said that around 40 Iraqis were killed in the blasts. Shiite shrines in Syria and Iraq are a frequent target of attacks by al Qaeda and Daesh. NA/PA
