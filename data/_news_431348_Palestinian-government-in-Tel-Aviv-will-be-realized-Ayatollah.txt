TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the Palestinian people will achieve “final “victory” over Israel in the not-too-distant future.
 “Palestine will remain powerful and the Palestinian nation’s final victory will take place in near future with the grace of God,” Ayatollah Khamenei said during a meeting with Ziad al-Nakhala, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad movement. Noting that resistance is key to victory, the Leader said, “As long as there is resistance, the Zionist regime’s downfall and demise will continue.”    “During the past years, the Palestinian people’s victory was not (to the extent) to establish a government in Tel Aviv, which that will be realized with the grace of God, but the main victory was bringing the Zionist regime to knees, a feat that Arab armies could never accomplish,” the Leader notes.“During the past years, the Palestinian people’s victory was not (to the extent) to establish a government in Tel Aviv, which will be realized with the grace of God, but the main victory was bringing the Zionist regime to knees, a feat that Arab armies could never accomplish,” the Leader remarked. Ayatollah Khamenei then referred to the Israeli military’s latest failed attempt in taking on Palestinian resistance groups in the Gaza Strip, which was met with an overwhelming response that forced the regime to call for a truce after only two days.  “The Zionist regime called for ceasefire in the two previous wars, one after 22 days and another after eight days. In the last clash, the regime (also) called for ceasefire after 48 hours. This means bringing the occupying Zionist regime to knees.” The Leader reiterated that the Zionist regime is on the wane. Elsewhere, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Iran will never back away from supporting Palestine despite the heavy pressure from the world’s arrogant powers. “These forces will never make us abandon our divine, sacred and rational responsibility,” Ayatollah Khamenei insisted.   For his part, Nakhala said that the Palestinian resistance front is stronger than ever and in case of a war it can target Israel with its missiles. Nakhala also said that the Palestinians will stand against “deal of the century”. U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed to establish a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty over around half of the West Bank and Abu Dis as its capital and has called his plan “deal of century”.
