TEHRAN- About $150 million worth of Iranian carpets were exported to the United States during the eight months to November 20, IRNA quoted Hamid Kargar, the head of Iran's National Carpet Center, on Monday. Due to the imposed sanctions, Iran’s export of carpets to the U.S. was zero in the same period in 2015,” he underlined.
The U.S. imposed a ban on carpet imports from the Islamic Republic, among other products, in September 2010, but has recently reopened its market after the removal of nuclear sanctions against Iran in January 2016.
