TEHRAN – The Guardian Council spokesman has said in the elections in May 2017 some booths may offer e-voting option.

 Abbasali Kadkhodaei said e-voting is a possibility that is contingent upon expert meetings and a consent by members of the Guardian Council, the IRIB reported on Saturday. E-voting would require the existence of necessary conditions so that the presidential elections are not negatively affected, he said. SP/PA
