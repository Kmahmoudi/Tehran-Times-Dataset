TEHRAN _ Bangkok- based geopolitical researcher Anthony Cartalucci says Haley's display is in line with U.S. decades long foreign policy to overthrow Iran’s political order Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, claimed Thursday that the international body has obtained “undeniable” evidence that Iran supplied Yemeni insurgents with missiles and other arms. But UN Secretary-General António Guterres reached no such conclusion in his report this month that addresses U.S. and Saudi claims the Houthi insurgents fired Iranian short-range ballistic missiles that nearly missed Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport on Nov. 4. To discuss the U.S. recent accusations against Iran and the real goals behind, we reached out to Bangkok- based geopolitical researcher Anthony Cartalucci. Commenting on the real reasons behind Haley’s allegations against Iran and the possible relation between these allegations and the developments going on in the region, Cartalucci said, “Since the Anglo-American interests were ousted from Iran decades ago, it has been a point of U.S. foreign policy to overthrow and replace Iran's political order. Haley's public display was done in the same vein as then United States Secretary of State Colin Powell's "weapons of mass destruction" speech given before the UN Security Council in 2003 - a speech he now considers a "blot" on his record for the obvious reason it was a lie fabricated as a pretext for war and regime change in Iraq.” He added, “Haley's demonstration is meant to move the entire region closer to a more direct confrontation with Iran, with the "Arab Spring" and resulting wars and proxy wars stretching from Libya to Syria and Iraq all part of a proxy conflict meant to first draw in Iranian military and economic power, overextend and exhaust it. With Russian-Iranian forces returning stability to Syria and Iraq, Iranian military and economic power will only recover from this point forward. The U.S. is moving its confrontation with Iran forward before Iran recovers from its regional operations, and before U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia deplete themselves further. The U.S. moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was meant as a provocation to further grease the wheels of war and move its engineered regional conflict forward.” Touching upon the possible Zionist regime’s lobby on the Haley’s show, he said, “The Anglo-American confrontation with Iran predates the existence of the Israeli state. Israel itself is a subordinate within U.S. foreign policy. It is intentionally portrayed as wielding unwarranted and overwhelming power within Washington and across the Middle East to give Washington a proxy of sufficient military capabilities - the actions of which the U.S. can maintain plausible deniability.” Cartalucci noted, “In this sense, while it would benefit Washington for the public to believe Haley's remarks were influenced by Israel, they are in fact spurred by a decades-long desire to wage war with Iran and overturn its political order on behalf of powerful Anglo-American interests expelled from Iran in the late 1970s.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
