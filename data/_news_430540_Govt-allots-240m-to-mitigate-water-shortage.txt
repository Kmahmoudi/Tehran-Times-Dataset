TEHRAN — Iran’s government has allocated some 10.02 trillion rials (nearly $240 million) to reduce water shortage nationwide, Ismail Najjar, head of the National Disaster Management Organization has said. 
 The amount is allocated to the Energy Ministry for taking necessary measures to tackle the issue, YJC quoted Najjar as saying on Monday. Climate change is actually happening in Iran, and with climate change, depletion of water resources, drought spells, low precipitations, changes in precipitation, temperature rise, desertification, and land subsidence also occur, he concluded.  MQ/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
