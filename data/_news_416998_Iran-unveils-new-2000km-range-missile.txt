TEHRAN – The Iranian military on Friday displayed a new ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles).
 The missile was unveiled at a military parade in southern Tehran. The new missile is called Khorramshahr – the name of a city in southern Iran which was occupied by the invading Saddam Hussein Army in the autumn of 1980. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Aerospace Force, said the missile can carry multiple warheads. “The peculiarities of this missile is that instead of carrying one warhead it can hit several targets with several warheads,” Hajizadeh told reporters on the sidelines of the parade marking the start of Iraq’s invasion of Iran on September 22, 1980. “The missile is able to carry warheads up to 1,800 kilometers,” Hazizadeh added. He also said the missile is “more tactical” and smaller in comparison to other ballistic missiles developed by the Defense Ministry.   PA/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
