TEHRAN – Iran’s tourism body have issued operating licenses for 15 newly constructed eco-lodges in Zanjan province. “With 58 eco-lodges, Zanjan ranks fifth nationwide next to Isfahan, Kerman, Yazd and Mazandaran provinces, having 260, 210, 79, and 69 eco-lodges respectively,” ISNA quoted Yahya Rahmati, the provincial tourism chief, as saying on Saturday. Back in May, government spokesman Mohammad-Baqer Nobakht pledged support for ecotourism by providing loans to applicants seeking to build eco-lodges. Due to a very diverse natural setting, Iran offers a lively and interesting environment to nature lovers. Sightseers may live with a nomad or rural family or enjoy an independent stay.
