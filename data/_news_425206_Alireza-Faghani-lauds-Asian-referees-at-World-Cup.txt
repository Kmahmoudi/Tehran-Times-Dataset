It's still not clear who will whistle the final match. We see an all European last four but there is no reason a European referee to officiate the final match. We have still a chance of officiating in the final. I believe that the all referees have done well so far despite the Video Assistant Referees (VAR). The 2019 AFC Asian Cup will be held in the UAE in January and the Asian referees are preparing for the competition.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
