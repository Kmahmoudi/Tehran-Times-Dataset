TEHRAN- No country can replace Iran in the global oil market, Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Amir-Hossein Zamaninia stressed. The official said that such imagination that some countries can replace Iran in the global oil market is wrong technically and politically, Tasnim news agency reported on Monday. U.S.’ sanctions against Iranian oil industry hurts stability of global oil markets, the deputy minister added. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced it will end waivers on crude purchase granted to Iran's primary oil buyers in a bid to push Tehran oil sales to zero.
