TEHRAN – Recent rainfall has greatly reduced the risk of sand and dust storms (SDSs) raising from major hotspots in north central province of Qom during summer, the provincial chief of department of environment has stated. Recent above normal rainfall resulted in dampening the soil surface and boosting the vegetation in dried dust generating areas, IRNA quoted Seyed Reza Mousavi Meshkini as saying on Sunday. Another benefit of recent rainfall is the flow of water in seasonal rivers and wetlands which can provide the water resources needed for wildlife, he said, adding, in addition to decreasing the chance of SDSs in the province. Many wetlands in Qom province have long been dried up which led to total disappearance of plant species and severe soil erosion, however, downpours made the soil moisturized and increased the vegetation, he explained. Speaking of the damages caused by recent floods, he lamented that many agricultural lands and gardens have been depleted in the province, regretting, some aquatic species also have been killed. He further expressed hope that with proper management of rainwater the province’s environment stays in good condition. According to the data published on National Drought Warning and Monitoring Center on Saturday Qom province received 209 millimeters of rain during the current water year (September 2018- September 2019) which shows a dramatic increase of 256 percent compared to last water year and 89 percent increase compared to long-term averages.  FB/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
