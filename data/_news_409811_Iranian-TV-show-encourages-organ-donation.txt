TEHRAN — An Iranian TV show, called Khandevaneh, has encouraged organ donation in one of its episodes so that it led to a record high for donor card registration within 36 hours. Shortly after the CEO of Iran’s organ donation society Katayoun Najafizadeh appeared in the night show and informed the public about brain death and organ donation some 40,000 registered for donor card in the website ehda.ir, according to ISNA news agency.    While normally some 500 to 1,000 people volunteer for organ donation on a daily basis the number jumped 80 times and reached 40,000 in 36 hours. Each brain dead patient can help some eight other patients with their organs and save their lives and such record breaking numbers reveals how media can play a key role in promoting good conducts.
