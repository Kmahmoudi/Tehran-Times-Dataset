TEHRAN – Governor general office of Isfahan province, the Department of Environment (DOE) and the Defense Ministry's Marine Industries Organization signed an agreement to support technological development of manufacturing electric vehicles in Isfahan on Wednesday, IRNA reported. The Isfahan governor general Mohsen Mehr-Alizadeh, chief of DOE Isa Kalantari and Iranian Defense Ministry's Marine Industries Organization head Rear Admiral Amir Rastegari signed the tripartite agreement. The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the opening ceremony of the permanent DC magnet motors production line at the Shahid Qorbani marine industry center in Shahin Shahr near Isfahan.   A permanent magnet motor is a type of brushless electric motor that uses permanent magnets rather than winding in the field. They are more efficient than traditional induction motors or motors with field windings for certain high-efficiency applications such as electric vehicles. The line provides electric motors for motorcycles, bicycles, evaporative coolers and pleasure boats in order to protect environment. According to the agreement, the Iranian Defense Ministry's Marine Industries Organization produce watercrafts with environment-friendly motors in order to protect wetland ecosystem.
