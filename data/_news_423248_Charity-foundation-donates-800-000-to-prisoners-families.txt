TEHRAN – The Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation has contributed 35 billion rials (nearly $800,000) to underprivileged families of prisoners during the past [Iranian calendar] year 1396 (March 2017 – March 2018), said Tehran Province's Relief Foundation director Mohsen Valiee. The foundation has supported 1,483 families by creating jobs and providing loans, allowances and medical costs for them, Mehr quoted him as saying on Saturday. Also, 10 prisoners who have committed involuntary crimes were freed by the help of philanthropists, the official highlighted. Touching on the possible harms which threat these families, Valiee said that the foundation tries to address some of their major problems.
