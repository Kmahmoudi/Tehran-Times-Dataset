TEHRAN – The Moscow-Tehran-Damascus triangle has now the upper hand and is the stronger coalition in Syria and it will be even stronger after Turkey joins it, the editor-in-chief of the Rai al-Youm newspaper wrote in an article published on Saturday.

 The cooperation will “change and destroy the priorities of the Saudi regime,” Abdel Bari Atwan wrote. “The Russian bombers’ flights from the Hamadan airbase was a firm message from Iran to Saudi Arabia and the (Persian) Gulf littoral states that the rules of the game are changing and it will be Yemen's turn after Syria,” Atwan added.
