TEHRAN – Iran has banned the import of foreign-made handicrafts in a bid to push up sales of domestically-made counterparts. The import suspension of non-Iranian handicrafts has been declared to the Iran Customs Administration, the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization deputy director Pouya Mahmoudian said on Tuesday. “Supplying foreign handicrafts such as Turkish, Chinese, and Indian ones to the Iranian market has always been one of the main concerns and challenges for the country’s handicraft producers and exporters.” The decision was made following two months of negotiations and joint meetings with the Trade Promotion Organization; the Ministry of Industry, Mining and Trade; and the Iran Customs Administration, she added. According to data compiled by the CHHTO, Iran exported $280 million worth of handicrafts during the past Iranian calendar year, ended on March 20. Germany, Armenia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Russia, the Netherlands, France, Italy, South Africa and the Persian Gulf littoral states constitute the main importers of Iranian handicrafts.
