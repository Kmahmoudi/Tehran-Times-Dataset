TEHRAN - Marc Finaud, the former French Foreign Ministry spokesman, says that the position of the European Union and its Member States regarding support for full implementation of the JCPOA has been clearly reaffirmed on several occasions and will not be changed even if some EU countries participate in Warsaw's Conference. Former Senior Resident Fellow at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) adds “At this stage, it is not even sure that the conference will take place or if it does, at which level and with which results.” A senior member of Geneva Centre for Security Policy also says that “The EU is committed to finalizing the entry into force of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in a near future and will not be distracted by the attitude of the U.S. Administration.” Following is the full text of the interview: Q: The United States has announced that it will hold a meeting in Poland on the issue of stability in the Middle East, but the name of the meeting is still vague and unclear. Although the Warsaw's Conference was initially announced against Iran, Acting Representative of the United States to the United Nations, Jonathan Cohen, recently announced that the Polish summit would not be to defame Iran. Why the goals and the name of the Polish meeting is Ambiguous and unclear? A: This initiative seems part of a U.S. campaign to rally support to the American policy towards Iran and overcome Washington’s isolation on the Iran Nuclear Deal. Q: If Warsaw's Conference been anti-Iranian, whether the presence of European countries in this summit will Undermine Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran (JCPOA)? A: The position of the European Union and its Member States regarding support for full implementation of the JCPOA has been clearly reaffirmed on several occasions and will not be changed even if some EU countries participate in this event. Q: Do you think that the presence of European countries in Warsaw's Conference will mean that Europe surrenders to trump, and then the SPV mechanism with Iran will no longer work? A: The EU is committed to finalizing the entry into force of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in a near future and will not be distracted by the attitude of the U.S. Administration. Q: Whether Warsaw's Conference will has a practical achievement against Iran? A: At this stage, it is not even sure that the conference will take place or if it does, at which level and with which results. Iran should maintain its consultations with its JCPOA partners to preserve the agreement and avoid responding to provocations.
