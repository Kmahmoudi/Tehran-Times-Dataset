TEHRAN – Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj held talks in Tehran with her Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday, discussing bilateral relations and other issues.
 “Inauguration of Shahid Beheshti Port shows boost of relations and also importance of this port in development of the region and improvement of routes that connect Central Asian countries with other countries through the Sea of Oman and the Indian Ocean,” Zarif said. For her part, Swaraj said New Delhi attaches great importance to expansion of relations with Iran. Iran, India and Afghanistan signed a tripartite trade and transit corridor agreement on Chabahar port in Tehran in May 2016. The treaty allows the three countries open new routes among themselves via converting the Iranian southeastern port of Chabahar into a transit hub. Accordingly, through Chabahar port India can bypass Pakistan and transport goods to Afghanistan and Central Asia, while Afghanistan can get linked to India via sea. The document was signed at the presence of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. According to the Indian Foreign Ministry’s website, Chabahar Port was scheduled to be inaugurated by Rouhani on Sunday at presence of Ministers from India, Afghanistan and the region. NA/PA
