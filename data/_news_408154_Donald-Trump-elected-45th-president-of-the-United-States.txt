Donald Trump will become the 45th president of the United States, a historic victory for outsiders that represents a stunning repudiation of Washington's political establishment.
 The billionaire real estate magnate and former reality star needed an almost perfect run through the swing states -- and he got it, winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. The Republican swept to victory over Hillary Clinton in the ultimate triumph for a campaign that repeatedly shattered the conventions of politics to pull off a remarkable upset. Clinton conceded to Trump in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Speaking at a victory party in New York, Trump was gracious toward Clinton and called for unity. "We owe (Clinton) a very major debt of gratitude to her for her service to our country," Trump said. "I say it is time for us to come together as one united people." He added: "I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans." Trump won with 288 electoral votes compared to 215 for Clinton, according to CNN projections. Trump's supporters embraced his plainspoken style, assault on political correctness and vow to crush what he portrayed in the final days of his campaign as a corrupt, globalized elite -- epitomized by the Clintons -- that he claimed conspired to keep hard-working Americans down.
