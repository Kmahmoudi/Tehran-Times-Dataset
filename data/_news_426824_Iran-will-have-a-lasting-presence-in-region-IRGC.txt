TEHRAN - Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Deputy Commander for Political Affairs Brigadier General Yadollah Javani has said that the era of the U.S. in the region has come to an end and it is Iran who will have a lasting presence in the region.
 “Today, America seeks to drive Iran out of the region through exerting economic pressure. However, evidence shows that the era of America in the region has come to an end and the Islamic Republic will have a lasting presence in the region,” he told Fars news agency in an interview published on Saturday. He noted that Iran will pass the current difficult situation and said that “future will be better that what others imagine”. “All say that America will cause collapse of Iran’s economy, but evidence shows that in spite of having shortcomings, the economy of Iran have capacities and will boost,” he said. He noted that extra endeavor is required to pass the current situation. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions was snapped back on August 6 and the second batch will be returned on November 4. Javani said that “economic war” is being conducted against the country and it is essential to focus on domestic capacities. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on August 13 that the Islamic Republic of Iran passed all the difficulties in the past and will also pass this difficult stage. He also refuted claims that the Islamic Republic reached a dead end. “Anyone who announces that we have reached a dead end is either ignorant or his words are treacherous.” NA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
