TEHRAN – Nine Iranian companies are displaying their latest productions at the 9th edition of Gamescom, a major trade fair for video games at the Koelnmesse in Cologne, Germany. Raspina, Nova Game, Simulator Developer, Fanafzar, Ano Resanye Honar, Paeezan, Tapsell, Arna, and Gorbehaye Tanbal are participating in the exhibition under the auspices of Iran’s National Foundation for Computer Games (NFCG). The NFCG selected the companies during the Tehran Game Convention (TGC), an exhibition of computer games that the foundation held in April. “By participating in Gamescom, the foundation aims to promote Iran’s game development industry, to attract international investors, and also to introduce the TGC,” a NFCG deputy director Farzad Fathi told the Persian service of MNA on Thursday. “The NFCG has supported the companies to participate in Gamescom in order to help the game developing technology and industry progress in our country,” he added. The NFCG has placed its main focus on Gamescom, which was inaugurated by Chancellor Angela Merkel last Tuesday, to attract more companies to the TGC 2018.    Mehrdad Ashtiani, a TGC advisor on international affairs, held meeting with representatives from many companies at Gamescom, discussing ways to establish relations with their companies. “The representatives of the companies paid visits to Iran’s pavilion at Gamescom to gather information about the TGC,” he said. The representative of G-Star, a South Korean game exhibition, has announced its readiness to expand relations with the TGC, he added. Gamescom will wrap up tomorrow as “Super Mario Odyssey” from Nintendo has been announced as best game at the event. The Gamescom award for best add-on/DLC was presented to “Battlefield 1: In the Name of the Tsar” from Electronic Arts, which also won the award for best booth.  Photo: People visit the 2017 Gamescom, a major trade fair for video games at the Koelnmesse in Cologne, Germany.
