TEHRAN- The budget bill for the next Iranian calendar year (starts on March 21, 2019) is estimated supplying 100 trillion rials-150 trillion rials (about $2.38 billion-$3.57 billion) of protective packages to the qualified Iranians, IRNA quoted the Head of Budget and Planning Organization Mohammad Baqer Nobakht as saying on Tuesday. The official had said on Monday that reducing the posed pressure by U.S. sanctions on Iranians’ lives, supplying basic goods, and paying a specific attention to domestic production and job creation are among the major options considered in the planned budget. Paying cash subsidies and supplying protective packages to qualified Iranians stand among other focal points in the next year’s budget, he added and informed that the government has accomplished preparation of the budget bill and is to present it to the parliament this Thursday. Also, Behrooz Nemati, the spokesman for the presiding board of the parliament, announced in a telephone interview with IRIB on Sunday night that the government has supposedly estimated sales of 1.5 million barrels per day of oil at the price of $54 per barrel in the budget bill. “Each dollar is predicted to worth 57,000 rials in the budget bill,” he added.
