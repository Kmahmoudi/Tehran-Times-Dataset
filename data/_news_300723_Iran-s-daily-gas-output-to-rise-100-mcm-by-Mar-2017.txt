TEHRAN- Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction Company Managing Director Gholamreza Manouchehri said that about 100 million cubic meters (mcm) per day will be added to Iran’s gas production capacity by the current Iranian yearend (ends March 20, 2017). The official added that the output increase will be achieved through having the five new platforms of South Pars gas field operational, according to the IRNA news agency.
“The new platforms will also pull up the country’s gas condensate production by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd),” Manouchehri stated.
As he elaborated, the platforms belong to phases 19, 20 and 21 of the gas field.
The senior official underscored that implementation of each of the South Pars phases will enlarge the country’s daily gas production by 2 mcm and will add to its gas condensate production by 40,000 bpd.
According to him, the implementation of these projects will bring the country $5 billion to $6 billion of daily revenues.
In the past Iranian calendar year of 1394, South Pars gas field produced 120 million bpd of gas condensates, which showed a 15-percent-upsurge compared to the preceding year.
Registering 15 percent rise, the field’s gas output escalated to 130 billion cubic meters (bmc) per day in the said time from its 113 bmc per day in year of 1393.
South Pars field, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves.   HJ/MA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
