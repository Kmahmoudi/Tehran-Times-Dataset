TEHRAN – Iran’s tourism chief inaugurated three tourist spots during his visit to the northwestern province of East Azarbaijan on Tuesday.  Ali Asghar Mounesan opened the centuries-old Yam caravanserai now repurposed to a boutique hotel, a museum devoted to sound and music gear, and “Iranian Home” which is an approach offering advantages of traditional handicrafts in modern homes, CHTN reported.  Yam caravanserai used to be a roadside inn where merchants and their livestock could rest and recover from long journey.    The museum contains over 300 items such as various traditional and classical musical instruments. It also features a rich archive of indigenous tonal and recorded music, comprising a collection of azan (the Islamic call to worship) soundtracks, and pardeh-khani performances.  “Iranian Home” made its debut at the 28th National Crafts Exhibition, which was held in Tehran last August. The initiative aims to promote Iranian crafts through presentation of their usefulness in practice.
