Washington’s sanctions against Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) are illegitimate and contravene international law, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Wednesday.
 “Our approach to unilateral sanctions, in general, is universal. We regard such methods as illegitimate and running counter to the norms of international law and the basic principles of interstate communication,” Ryabkov said, the Tass news agency reported.  The Americans have “turned sanctions into a key tool of their foreign policy”, he remarked. Ryabkov added the responsibility for the possible “collapse” of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - the official name for the nuclear deal - will lie entirely with the U.S. “The situation is deteriorating, as the sentiment in the U.S. Congress is highly anti-Iranian,” he noted.  “No changes, amendments or corrections to the current agreement are possible, as it is a very well-measured and delicate balance of interests and compromises.” “Just like other JCPOA participants, we believe that the key objective now is to fully implement what has been achieved.” Elsewhere, he said that the U.S. is trying to negatively affect cooperation between Moscow and Teheran. “Iran is our neighbor, partner and a friendly country,” he said.  “Under the current circumstances, as both our countries are subject to the ongoing pressure of our ill-wishers, including the United States, who has made it its policy, it is even more important to maintain contacts and cooperation [between Russia and Iran] in every field,” he added. Commenting on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Iran, Ryabkov said that the visit will be marked by new important agreements.
