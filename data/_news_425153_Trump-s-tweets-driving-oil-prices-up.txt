TEHRAN - Iran’s Representative to OPEC Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweet has raised oil prices by at least $10, Shana reported.
 “Your tweets have increased the prices by at least $10. Please stop this method,” Kazempour said. According to the official, if Trump doesn’t stop this trend the prices will go even higher. In an Interview with Reuters, Kazempour warned the expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would help bring down prices were in vain, saying that oil will soon cost $100 per barrel due to supply disruptions caused by the U.S. president. He said Trump was trying to intensify tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Trump again accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of driving fuel prices higher on Wednesday, and urged U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia to pump more if they wanted Washington to continue protecting them against Iran.
