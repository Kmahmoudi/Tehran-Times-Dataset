TEHRAN – Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani has voiced Iran’s readiness to confront any “irresponsibility” or failure by the other side to remain committed to the international nuclear deal. In a Saturday meeting with the leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) Ramadan Shalah, Shamkhani said the nuclear deal is a clear sign of the Islamic Republic’s soft power in opposing the hegemonic powers, Fars news agency reported. “As well as defending our legal rights, we have predicted measures against any trivial or serious disloyalty [to the nuclear deal],” he noted. He also denounced the Zionist lobby for its impact on the implementation of the nuclear accord. The nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), went into force in January. Under the deal, Iran is tasked to curb some aspects of its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Elsewhere in his remarks, Shamkhani described the Palestinian cause as the most important priority for the Muslim world, saying, “Any action that leads to a distraction from fighting Israel as the main threat to the Muslim world, is a treason against all Muslims throughout the world.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
