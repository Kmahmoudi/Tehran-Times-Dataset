Symphony of colors have always been a key characteristic of Bakhtiari nomads in southwest Iran. The picture shows a Bakhtiari girl holding up a copy of the Holy Quran and a box of traditional sweets for good omen during a wedding ceremony on September 8, 2017. She is encircled with ethnic fellows clad in vivid colorful garments who are adding charm to the ceremony with a traditional performance.  It’s perhaps surprising for some to learn that Iran is not a country made up of one people, but rather a mosaic of diverse ethnic groups, cultures and religions. Azaris, Kurds, Lurs, Turkmen, Baluchis, Bakhtiaris, and Arabs are just some of the many different ethnic groups coexisting in the country.   (Photo Farhad Safari/Tehran Times) All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
