TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that Tehran will file a complaint to the UN against U.S. over claims that Iran has supplied missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen.
 “Iran will file complaint at the UN against the U.S. claims,” IRNA quoted him as saying in an email to Sputnik. The Foreign Ministry confirmed the correspondence. U.S. Ambassador to UN Nikki Haley on Thursday presented the debris of a missile at a military base in Washington in which she claimed it was made by Iran and used on November 4 by Yemen’s Houthi group to target an airport near Riyadh. In a tweet on Friday, Zarif said, “While Iran has been calling for ceasefire, aid and dialogue in Yemen from day 1, U.S. has sold weapons enabling its allies to kill civilians and impose famine. No amount of alternative facts or alternative evidence covers up U.S. complicity in war crimes.” Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference on Saturday, he said Haley’s claims are “unfounded”. Zarif said Haley’s claims were not “authentic” and not even convincing for the Westerners. The foreign minister also said the accusations by Haley were intended to deflect attention from international condemnation of Donald Trump’s move in recognizing al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel.  Alexandre Giorgini, the French foreign ministry deputy spokesman, said on Friday, “The United Nations secretariat has not, at this stage, drawn any conclusions. France continues to examine the information at its disposal.” Brigadier General Ramazan Sharif, the spokesman for the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, said it is no secret that the Soviet Union and North Korea had sold missiles to Yemen.
