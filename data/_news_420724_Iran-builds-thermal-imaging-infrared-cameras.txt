TEHRAN – Domestic experts at Iran’s defense industry have managed to design and manufacture thermal imaging infrared cameras to be used for a range of anti-armor guided missile systems. Experts have manufactured thermographic cameras to be installed on various anti-armor missile systems, including Toofan, Dehlavieh, and Tosan, Tasnim reported. They have built “RU244TK” thermographic cameras with cooled infrared detectors and “RU150TK” with uncooled detector technology.   A thermographic camera is a device that forms an image using infrared radiation, similar to a common camera that forms an image using visible light.
