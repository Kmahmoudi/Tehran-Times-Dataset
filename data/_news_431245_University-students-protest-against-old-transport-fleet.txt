TEHRAN — Hundreds of university students participated in a demonstration at Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch, in Tehran on Saturday, to stage their protest about old transport fleet which led recently to the death and injury of dozens of their peers.
 In a bus rollover at the Islamic Azad University, northwestern Tehran, on December 25, ten were killed and 28 were injured. Some of the injured are in a critical condition and the rest have sustained serious injuries.  After the accident many announced that the driver had a hard attack at the time of the crash. However, the main reason behind the deadly bus crash seems to be the old transport system as the driver lost the vehicle control after its brakes failed.  According to IRNA news agency some of the family members of the students who were killed in the bus crash also joined the demonstration.  The university has already fired five officials who are held accountable for the bus crash.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
