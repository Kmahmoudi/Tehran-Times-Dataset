TEHRAN - Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani said on Thursday that Iran, Russia and Syria are strongly determined to fight Takfiri terrorism. During a meeting with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu in Tehran, Shamkhani praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for supporting the fight against terrorism in Syria. An increase in political, security and military complexities of the Syrian crisis will lead to more killings and sufferings by the Syrian people, the top security official noted. The U.S. and its allies’ approach towards the Syrian crisis shows that they seek to create a “margin of security” for the Zionist regime of Israel and influence the public opinion to achieve their political objectives, he said. Shamkhani, a former defense minister, also highlighted the need to maintain the Syrian territorial integrity and national unity. Condemning open interference in the Syrian internal affairs, he noted it is the Syrian people who should decide on the competency of their governing system. Elsewhere, he urged the international community to help Iran, Russia and Syria in their fight on terrorism. It is necessary that inter-Syrian dialogue replace “war and bloodletting” in the country. ‘International duty’ For his part, Shoygu said fighting terrorism is an “international duty”. Shoygu expressed hope that meeting of the Iranian, Russian and Syrian defense chiefs would increase cooperation in fighting terrorism and helping establish security in Syria. ‘Iran, Russia and Syria to activate political maneuvering’  During a separate meeting with Syrian Defense Minister Fahd Jassem al-Freij on Friday, Shamkhani also said Iran, Russia and Syria will activate their “political capacity” to reach a strategy in order to end the war in Syria. He reiterated the position by the Islamic Republic that Iran will continue supporting Syria in campaign against terrorism. Shamkhani also said that “counter-constructive and political” view of the U.S. and its allies toward the Syrian crisis has greatly exacerbated the situation on the ground. He described the inter-Syrian dialogue as the only way to put an end to the conflict in the country. Freij, for his part, thanked Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, the Iranian government and people for supporting Syria in war against terrorists. General al-Freij said the Syrian government and people keep fighting terrorism till the phenomenon is eradicated.
