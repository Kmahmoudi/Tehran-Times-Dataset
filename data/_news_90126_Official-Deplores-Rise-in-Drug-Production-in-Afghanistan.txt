The Public Relations Department at the Anti-Narcotics Headquarters quoted Hashemi as telling an expert at German Technical Cooperation Organization (GTZ) Christoph Berg that 2,700 to 3,000 tons of drugs are expected to be produced in Afghanistan this year, IRNA reported. He said that in the past two decades more than 2.2 million kilograms of drugs, smuggled into Iran by drug smugglers from Afghanistan, has been seized. He added that Iran had in the period been firmly trying to confront supply of drugs, smuggled into the country from Afghanistan. He said that however, Iran spends about 50 percent of its resources in its national strategy on lowering demand for drugs given increasing number of addicts in the country. Berg, for his part, called for Tehran-Berlin cooperation in drugs campaign and consumption. He said Berlin is ready to cooperate with Tehran in exchange of experience on ways and means of lowering demand for drugs.
