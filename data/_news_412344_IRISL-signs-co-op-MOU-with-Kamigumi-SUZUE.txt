The MOU includes cooperation on construction of dry ports in Iran as well as making investments on improvement of terminals in Iranian ports.

(DSME) on establishing a shipbuilding company in Iran.  Earlier in December 2016, South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries Company, Ltd. (HHI) accepted to build mega-container vessels as well as tankers for carrying petroleum products for Iran, due to its agreement with IRISL.  Norway’s SKULD marine insurance company also signed a memorandum of understanding in the field of shipping insurance with IRISL back in August 2016.
