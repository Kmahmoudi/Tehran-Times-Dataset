TEHRAN- The Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs, Reza Najafi, slammed on Saturday the steps taken by certain nations to impose restrictions on the supply of medicine to other countries, calling such a ban as “illegal, barbaric, and disgraceful.”  The statement was made during a speech given to the high-level meeting of the Group of Friends of Neutrality for Peace, Security, and Sustainable Development, which was hosted by Turkmenistan.  “Countries placing restrictions on the supply of medicine are, in effect, using pharmaceuticals and medical equipment as a weapon against patients, which is utterly unlawful, barbaric, and disgusting,” Najafi said in describing sanctions as a type of “economic terrorism”. The Iranian diplomat added that the use of unilateral coercive measures, such as sanctions, is one of the destabilizing factors undermining global peace and security.  These actions not only blatantly violate human rights but also impede the economic and social advancement of their target nations, he added. Such unilateral coercive measures are reckless, a flagrant breach of international law, and go against the fundamental tenets of international humanitarian law, he said. On Turkmenistan's proposal, the Group of Friends of Neutrality for Peace, Security, and Sustainable Development was founded in 2020 with the aim of resolving disputes amicably. It consists of roughly 20 members. Despite Iran's complete compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the United States under former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in May 2018, reimposed sanctions and introduced new ones. The financial routes needed to import medicines or medical equipment have been blocked by the sanctions. Albeit, Washington and its Western allies purportedly said that humanitarian aid is immune from sanctions, thousands of Iranian patients have throughout the years perished or suffered serious illnesses due to lack of vital medications. Iran is unable to get life-saving medications and medical supplies due to the broad restriction on banking transactions. Officials in Tehran say the U.S. has warned firms in Europe and other nations to avoid doing business with Iran. The problem grew more serious in 2020 when the Coronavirus swept over Iran and the nation was forced to postpone a national vaccination campaign against the illness. Financial restrictions made it hard to pay for vaccine supplies. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
