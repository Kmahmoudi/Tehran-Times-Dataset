TEHRAN - Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir has said that Saudi Arabia is not against dialogue and talks with Iran, ISNA reported on Saturday.
 In an interview with Al Jazeera published on October 1, Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said that Iran is open to starting a dialogue with Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region. “An Iranian-Saudi dialogue could solve many of the region’s security and political problems,” Larijani predicted. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on September 30 that he believes Saudi Arabia is looking to de-escalate tensions with Iran. In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera, he said, “Everybody is open to dialogue.”  “Iran says [it is] willing to negotiate if sanctions are lifted; the U.S. [also] asks for dialogue ... neither does Saudi Arabia close the door for dialogue,” Abdul Mahdi said. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes program aired on September 29 that he preferred a peaceful resolution with Iran, describing it as “much better than the military” option. Imran Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, visited Tehran on October 13 to “facilitate” possible dialogue between Iran and Saudi Arabia which have been at loggerheads over a number of issues including the Saudi war on Yemen and Riyadh’s support for Trump’s anti-Iran moves. He met with Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in October that Iran and Saudi Arabia should bridge differences. In an interview with Aaj News, Qureshi said that Pakistan will continue efforts in line with reducing tension in Tehran-Riyadh relations. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric has said that Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, welcomes Khan’s initiative to de-escalate tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Ammar al-Hakim, leader of the Iraqi National Wisdom Movement, has also expressed support for Pakistan’s initiative to mediate between Iran and Saudi Arabia. On October 12, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Tehran is ready for a talk with Saudi Arabia with or without a mediator. During a joint press conference with Khan in Tehran on October 13, Rouhani, without mentioning Saudi Arabia, suggested that Iran will give a positive response to “good intention”. Rouhani said Iran “welcomes efforts by the Pakistani prime minister to settle tensions in the region” and “restore peace and stability”.
