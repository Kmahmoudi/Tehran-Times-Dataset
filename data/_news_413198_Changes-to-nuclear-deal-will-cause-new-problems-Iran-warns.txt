TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani warned the Donald Trump administration on Saturday that making changes to the nuclear agreement will cause new problems.
 In April, the Trump administration claimed that it is reviewing the nuclear agreement.  Larijani said Iran is committed to its obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - the official name for the nuclear deal.  The chief parliamentarian made the remarks while opening the oil, gas and petrochemical industry exhibition in Tehran. Iran and the six major powers (the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany) reached the nuclear deal in July 2015. The agreement went into effect in January 2016. Elsewhere, Larijani said that the Middle East is an “important oil and gas region” and the regional situation influences other countries’ behavior.  He also said Iran is a safe country in the volatile Middle East region due to “strategic decision” being made by its officials. He said terrorism has been spread in the region and Iran has adopted policies to counter it, a move which he said has been acknowledged by the international community. Larijani added it is difficult to predict future of the region, because of some regional actors’ behavior.
