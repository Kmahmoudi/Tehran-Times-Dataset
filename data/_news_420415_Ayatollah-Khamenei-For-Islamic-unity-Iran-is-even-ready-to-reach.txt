TEHRAN – The Leader of the Islamic Revolution on Tuesday strongly criticized the United States for its recent move to recognize al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel, saying the dare to make this move was unseemly bold. “They cannot do such a thing and their efforts will not bear results,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with senior lawmakers attending the Parliamentary Union of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference in Tehran. The U.S. adventure on Palestine will get nowhere, he said, underlining that “Palestine is a collection, a country, and a history. Palestine is from the river to the sea and al-Quds is without a doubt its capital.” The Leader attached great importance to the issue of “Palestine” and “unity in the Islamic world”. Ayatollah Khamenei said the injustices against the Palestinians are “unprecedented in history” as their land was occupied, expelled in millions and subjected to cruelty. The Islamic world should play influential role in important issues facing the world and “prevent bitter experiences of the past decades and domination of (great) powers to be repeated,” he stated. Leader says for the sake of Islamic unity Iran is “even ready to act in a brotherly manner toward those who appeared blatantly inimical” to the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khamenei went on to say that issues related to the Islamic world should be expressed frankly in order to prove effective on the public opinion and the talented people in the larger world. “The dangerous propaganda emperor of the West, which is run mainly by the Zionists, should not be allowed to ignore the world of Islam’s important issues and wipe out them by the ‘plot of silence’,” the Leader of the Islamic Revolution remarked. He noted that it is possible to defeat the Zionists through “soft war” as they were defeated in the war in Lebanon in 2006 and forced to admit it. The Leader also described the Palestine issue as the first priority of the Islamic world. Ayatollah Khamenei also called on Muslim nations to help resolve the crises in Yemen and Bahrain, saying they are among the important issues facing the Muslim world. The Leader also urged Muslim countries to be explicit vis-à-vis the fundamental issues of the Muslim world in order to be able to influence public opinion. He added Islamic unity is so important that Iran is “even ready to act in a brotherly manner toward those who appeared blatantly inimical to us”. Ayatollah Khamenei also said that the Islamic world can emerge as a big, influential global power by tapping its resources SP/NA/  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
