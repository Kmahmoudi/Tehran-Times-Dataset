TEHRAN – Noise pollution in metropolises of Iran is 20 times acuter than standards, said Mohammad-Reza Esmaeilpour, occupational health and safety professor at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. A major part of noise pollution is produced by cars and traffic jams, said Esmaeilpour, adding that motorcycles have the most significant share among vehicles. Noise pollution is being neglected since it doesn’t claim lives, however, it has major negative psychological and physical effects on humans, he added. This kind of environmental pollution can lead to miscarriage, hypertension, heart attack, hearing loss and reducing efficiency in workspace, highlighted the professor. He further referred to ‘comprehensive noise pollution plan’ which has been sent to Tehran’s city council, hoping that it would be hammered out and implemented in all cities of Iran. The most important parts of this plan is reducing the noise produced by motorcycles in vehicle inspection procedures and achieving the required standards in buildings, he noted. Noise pollution is an unwanted or disturbing sound which can interfere with normal activities for humans and wildlife, such as sleeping, communication, or disrupt or diminish one's quality of life. It can come from many sources, such as automobiles, motorcycles, aircraft, ships, trucks, buses, jet planes, construction equipment, electrical machinery, lawn mowers and leaf blowers, to name a few.
