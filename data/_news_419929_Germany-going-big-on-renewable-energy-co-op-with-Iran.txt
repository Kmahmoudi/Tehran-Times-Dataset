TEHRAN - German Energy Company Athos Solar has invested near €42.5 million in Iran’s renewable energy sector constructing 35 megawatts (MW) capacity of solar farms in Hamedan Province, west central Iran.  As reported by IRNA, the company has built four 7-megawatt solar farms so far and yet another farm with the same capacity is under construction. Construction of the solar farms is fully financed by the German party since according to Christian Linder, CEO of Athos Solar, “This is the only way that projects can be financed in Iran at present, while claiming that financing via banks is not yet possible.” Inaugurating the first two solar farms of the five ones constructed by the German company, in February 2017, Linder said: “These are the first large-scale solar systems to be built in Iran after the sanctions were lifted in spring 2016.”  EF/MA
