TEHRAN - First Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri on Monday said for trade to expand between Iran and Uruguay, contracts should be concluded and grounds laid.    Jahangiri said this to a high-ranking gathering of Iranian-Uruguayan officials in Tehran in which Uruguayan Vice-President Raul Sendic was also present.
A good starting point is banking ties, the Iranian vice president suggested.
Referring to economic capacities of Uruguay particularly in the agriculture sector, the vice president noted Uruguayan businesses can claw back their share of the Iranian market under the two governments’ supports.
According to Jahangiri, direct trade between Tehran and Montevideo is the best scenario possible as there are no political obstacles on the Iranian side.
“(However) for the two countries to restore their trade transactions to the level it was in the past, more time as well as involvement of the private sector are required,” he was quoted as saying. 
Also, Jahangiri stressed the need for activating the joint economic commission, saying, “Within the framework of the commission, necessary agreements should be signed and previous ones updated.”
Among other areas of cooperation, Jahangiri named culture, sports, and science.
Sendic, for his part, said in spite ups and downs, bilateral ties between the two countries has always been friendly over the past 35 years.
On obstacles to boosting ties with Iran prior to the lifting of sanctions, Sendic said the sanctions regime stymied smooth and steady expansion of relations. 
Having reminded that Uruguay has always tried to keep its relations with Iran, Sendic said, “Today in the post-sanctions era, we are ready to take longer strides to expand bilateral trade.”
Also, the Uruguayan official called for closer ties in banking, animal heath, oil, and agriculture.
A highlight in Sendic’s remarks was his call for the formation of a joint economic commission, which can act as a catalyst, facilitating economic relations between the two countries.  AK/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
