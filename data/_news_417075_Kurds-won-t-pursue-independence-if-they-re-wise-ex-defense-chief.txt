TEHRAN – Iran’s former defense minister on Saturday said the Iraqi Kurds would not pursue independence if they have any “wisdom”, Tasnim reported. The former minister added, “Nobody would tolerate an independent Kurdistan.” He said the president of the Iraqi Kurdish region Masoud Barzani is trying to gain concessions from Iraq’s central government. Reminding the Kurdish officials that their region is landlocked, the general said neighboring countries would never agree with such move. MH/PA
