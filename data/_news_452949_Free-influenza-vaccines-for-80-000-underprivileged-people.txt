TEHRAN – Influenza vaccines have been provided free of charge to some 80,000 people under the coverage of the Welfare Organization, the head of the Organization has announced. The Ministry of Health is implementing a national plan aiming to provide two million doses of influenza vaccines for at-risk groups such as the elderly, transplant patients, cardiopulmonary patients, and pregnant women to reduce COVID-19 effects. According to the national plan on influenza vaccination, the distribution of vaccine is the responsibility of the University of Medical Sciences in different provinces, Vahid Qobadi Dana stated. Personnel and the elderly living in daycare centers as well as the physically disabled in the Welfare Organization are in priority, he highlighted. He went on to note that up to 80,000 people who are in welfare organization’s care centers are eligible to receive free vaccines.
