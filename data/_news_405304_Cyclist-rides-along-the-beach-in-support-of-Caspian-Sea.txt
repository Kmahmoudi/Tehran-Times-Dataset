TEHRAN — An Iranian cyclist is riding along the Caspian Sea beach in support of protecting the sea’s environment, the Department of Environment website reported. Iraj Roughanchi started the trip on the Caspian Sea Day, August 12, from Bandar Torkaman, Golestan province, and will finish in Astara, Gilan province. He predicts that it takes him 10 to 14 days to finish the quest. This is the fourth time that Roughanchi, who is also an environmentalist, is cycling in support of the Caspian Sea. Last year he took the same trip in support of the Caspian seal, an animal which is on the verge of extinction.
