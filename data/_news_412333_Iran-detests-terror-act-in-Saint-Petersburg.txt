TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Monday strongly condemned the terrorist attack in the Russian city of Saint Petersburg which left at least 14 people killed.
 Qassemi reiterated Tehran’s position on the need for a “collective international involvement” in the fight against terrorism. Determination of the international bodies is required to root out such “brutal crimes”, he added. A bomb blast on the St. Petersburg metro on Monday killed at least 14 people and over 50 wounded. One more explosive device was found at another metro station and neutralized by the specialists, Sputnik reported. President Vladimir Putin had been in St. Petersburg earlier in the day. According to Kyrgyz intelligence, a Russian citizen born in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan is the prime suspect of the attack. Mehdi Sanai, the Iranian ambassador to Moscow, also condemned the attack on Tuesday. He offered condolences to the Russian government, people and families of the victims. The ambassador said that the terrorist attack proves this bitter fact that terrorist threats are not restricted to one country. In a meeting with Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Erlan Abdyldayev, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the attack “once again shows the importance of stepping up joint efforts to combat this evil”.
