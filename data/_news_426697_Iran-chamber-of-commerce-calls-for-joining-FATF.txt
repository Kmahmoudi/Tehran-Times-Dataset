TEHRAN – Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) has called on the Iranian establishment to join the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to repair financial ties with the world, ISNA reported on Sunday. “Given that not being on the list of countries approved by the FATF is an undeniable problem and it will lead to a significant reduction in financial relations with Iran, the Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture, according to the private sector’s opinions, wants Iran to join this group,” the ICCIMA said in a statement. Iran has less than two months to adopt financial reforms proposed by the FATF as part of efforts to improve connections to the international banking and trade system.
