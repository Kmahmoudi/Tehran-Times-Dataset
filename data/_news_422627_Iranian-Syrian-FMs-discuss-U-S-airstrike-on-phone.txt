TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Syrian counterpart Walid Muallem talked on the phone on Saturday to exchange views on the recent U.S.-led airstrike against Syria. During the call, Zarif condemned the criminal and illegal act of the U.S., Britain and France which jointly targeted Syria on Saturday morning.  The unilateral and military move taken by the U.S. and its allies against Syria on pretext of the alleged use of chemical weapons was aimed at disrupting the peace process and helping the terrorists, Iran’s chief diplomat remarked. He also appreciated the resistance of the Syrian government and people in the fight against terrorism, Mehr reported.
