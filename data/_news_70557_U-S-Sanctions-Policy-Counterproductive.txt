The Shanghai-based daily ****Wenhui***** wrote in its latest edition that the U.S. maintains that the sanctions will prevent Iran from becoming more powerful. However, it said that, with the failure of the U.S. sanctions, the Islamic Republic, which enjoys high capabilities for development, can become a powerful country. The daily added that under current conditions, the U.S. is forced to rely on its current policy, which will result in Washington being deprived of its economic interests in Iran. This will certainly have a negative impact on U.S. ties with its European allies and Japan. ****Wenhui**** said that although the U.S. has extended the sanctions against Iran for five years, the Spanish, Italian, British, Dutch and Japanese companies have paid no heed to them and have frustrated Washington's sanctions policy against Tehran.
