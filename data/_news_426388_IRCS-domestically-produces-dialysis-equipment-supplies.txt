He went on to say that last [Iranian calendar] year (March 2017-March 2018) the company produced 1.8 million dialysis solution and this year the company has set sight on producing 2.1 million filters increasing its share in market to 50 percent.  According to kidney.org, healthy kidneys clean your blood and remove extra fluid in the form of urine. They also make substances that keep your body healthy. Dialysis replaces some of these functions when your kidneys no longer work.  In hemodialysis, a dialysis machine and a special filter called an artificial kidney, or a dialyzer, are used to clean your blood. To get the blood into the dialyzer, the doctor needs to make an access, or entrance, into the blood vessels. The dialyzer, or filter, has two parts, one for your blood and one for a washing fluid called dialysate. A thin membrane separates these two parts. Blood cells, protein and other important things remain in your blood because they are too big to pass through the membrane. Smaller waste products in the blood, such as urea, creatinine, potassium and extra fluid pass through the membrane and are washed away.
