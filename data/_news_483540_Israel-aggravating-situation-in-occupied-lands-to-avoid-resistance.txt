TEHRAN- Storm into Al-Aqsa Mosque by Israeli forces have drawn vitriol from Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) chief commander, who asserted that Tel Aviv is inflaming tensions throughout the occupied territories in an effort to thwart the Palestinian resistance and revengeful actions aimed at areas deep inside Israel. The comments were delivered by Major General Hossein Salami at a meeting with a number of IRGC commanders, officials, managers, and staff on Saturday. “In an effort to avoid an Intifada and Palestinian resistance, particularly among young people in the West Bank and elsewhere, the phony and criminal Zionist regime is currently causing complications throughout the occupied areas,” he noted, adding, “The Gaza Strip is under bombardment, and horrific atrocities are being committed against the downtrodden Palestinians. But they won’t succeed with such strategies.” He added that for 13 weeks straight, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated in Tel Aviv and other cities against a contentious judicial reform that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-right administration is attempting to implement, calling the protests “unprecedented.” Elsewhere in his remarks, the IRGC head said the U.S. is in decline. Those who once wholeheartedly backed the U.S. president, sought political refuge in Washington, and attached their own life to U.S. policies are now separating themselves from the White House and its rash decisions, the major general pointed out. General Salami also alluded to the autumn unrest in Iran, saying that attempts to overthrow the Islamic government had been made by the enemies of Islam together but failed utterly. “The U.S., Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Zionist regime and a number of reactionary regimes in the region, together with several sell-outs, political opponents…, had assembled an evil coalition to defeat the Islamic establishment, obliterate Islam from Iran’s political scene, and return Iran back to the era before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.” General Salami also underlined that “the foes did not even hem and haw to officially declare that they backed the overthrow of Iran’s Islamic Republic.” “The maximum pressure campaign heightened, strategies of isolation were placed at the heart of the enemies’ policies, and a full-scale psychological warfare was openly waged against the Iranian nation, the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Khamenei and the IRGC,” Salami added.
