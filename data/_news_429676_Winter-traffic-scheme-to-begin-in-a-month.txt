TEHRAN —Winter traffic scheme, aiming to increase road safety during cold weather, will begin on December 13 and end on March 13, Traffic Police chief Taqi Mehri has said.
 All responsible bodies should collaborate with the police to reduce traffic-related accidents, Mehr news agency quoted Mehri as saying on Sunday. Special measures will be employed to prevent road icing, avalanche and flooded roads both inside and outside the cities, He added. Unfortunately last year some 3,400 individuals lost their lives in accidents last year during winter, he lamented, adding that 68 percent of them were killed in accidents outside the cities.  22 percent of the accidents were caused by overspending, 38 percent due to drowsy driving and distracted driving and 13 percent resulted from overtaking last winter, Mehri explained.   Having enough fuel and snow chains are mandatory during winter, he highlighted.  According to superiorpaint.com, distracted driving, excessive speeding, and tailgating are dangerous no matter what the weather, but some causes of accidents are particular to winter. Be extra cautious this winter to avoid collisions in these circumstances. Ice: Icy roads are probably the single most frequent cause of winter accidents. Ice on the road makes braking, turning, accelerating, and backing up more difficult. When driving on ice, be sure to be extra cautious. It’s a good idea to plan routes that avoid hills and to use major roads that are frequently plowed. While attempting to brake in a car with anti-lock brakes, apply gentle constant pressure. If your car doesn’t have anti-lock brakes, you should pump your brakes to stop more effectively.  Winter tires in good condition will definitely help, but caution is still a must. Bald Tires: Before each winter, you should bring your car in for a general check-up. The state of your tires is important to asses before driving in snowy or icy conditions. Bald tires are a common cause of winter accidents because they are ineffective at gripping the road. Be sure to have your tires rotated and checked for bare spots before it gets too icy on the roads. Poor Visibility: Snow and ice that builds up overnight on your car’s windshield is a constant source of winter frustration. Always wait to begin your excursion until your windshield is completely clear of ice. Keep your windshield wipers in working condition and always be sure to fill your wiper fluid. A functioning defrost system inside your car is also imperative during winter. MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
