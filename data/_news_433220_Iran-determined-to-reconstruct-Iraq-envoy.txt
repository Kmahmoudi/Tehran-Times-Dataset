TEHRAN – Iraj Masjedi, the Iranian ambassador to Baghdad, has voiced Iran’s readiness to reconstruct Iraq, saying cooperation in reconstruction of the Arab country is already happening, IRNA reported on Wednesday. “Iran is determined to reconstruct the Daesh-stricken Iraqi towns and cities in a similar way that it supported the friendly and brotherly government and people of the country during the fight against Daesh,” Masjedi said during a meeting with officials of the Council of Balad in Iraq’s Salaheddin Province. The ambassador added no one can create a rift between the two nations of Iran and Iraq. “Iranian companies initiated reconstructing and strengthening infrastructures in Iraq and this trend would continue.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
