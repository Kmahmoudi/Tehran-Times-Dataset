TEHRAN – Iran’s government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Wednesday that the nuclear deal was signed between Iran and six countries, not just the U.S., and definitely a “rearrangement” will be on the way if the Trump administration quit the multilateral agreement.
 “Iran will definitely protect national interests in the (new) rearrangement,” Nobakht told reporters. “If the country (Iran) is supposed to continue [to implement the nuclear deal] with the other five countries [Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany], it will be in a way that our interests is protected,” he noted. He added that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name for the nuclear deal, is not just a deal between Iran and the U.S. and Iran has interaction with the other five signatories. Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council including the United States signed the nuclear deal in July 2015. It went into effect in January 2016. Yukiya Amano, chief of the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency, reconfirmed on Monday that Iran is honoring its commitments under the nuclear deal. On September 5 U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley laid out a case for President Donald Trump to step back from the nuclear deal, arguing that Iran's technical compliance alone isn't enough for the U.S. to stick with the pact.  In a carefully read 20-minute address at the American Enterprise Institute, Haley argued that the nuclear deal can't be considered in isolation.  Trump has called the agreement between Iran and six major powers reducing its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief “the worst deal ever negotiated”.
