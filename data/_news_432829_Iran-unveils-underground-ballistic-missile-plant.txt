The Aerospace Division of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) unveiled on Thursday an underground plant manufacturing precision-guided ballistic missiles, Press TV reported. “Unveiling this missile production city deep underground is an answer to the idle talk made by the Westerners, who assume they can restrict us and dissuade us from [pursuing] our long-term goals by means of threats and sanctions,” IRGC chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said during the unveiling ceremony. Elsewhere in his remarks, Jafari said Iran’s defense might was in line with the country’s deterrence doctrine and was by no means open to negotiations. “Iran’s defensive capability is deterrent [in nature] and in line with preserving its national security, and it cannot be subjected to any transaction or negotiation,” the commander asserted. “Today, the Europeans are talking of imposing restrictions and sanctions on our defensive capability, while egregiously, their offensive capability is being used to attack the oppressed and innocent people throughout the world,” he said. “But, we proudly enhance our defensive capability and are not afraid of anything.” The ceremony, which was attended by the commander of the IRGC’s Aerospace Division, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, also featured the inauguration of a smart surface-to-surface missile called Dezful. Hajizadeh said national security is the Iranian Armed Forces’ red line, noting the Dezful missile was the latest product of the Aerospace Division’s research activities. Describing the projectile’s features, he compared the success achieved through its production to that of the Zolfaqar ballistic missile, whose mass production the country began in September 2016.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
