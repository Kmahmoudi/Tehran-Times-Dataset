"With an exchange of ideas and experiences, they can understand the problems that exist in the way of freight transportation, thus attempt to solve the problems. By presenting guidelines, they can draw a clear picture of the role of governments and the serious presence of the private sector." He continued, "In the development of freight transportation on existing global paths, and in increasing the share of freight railway transportation, governments have a vital role." He said that before its connection to Bandar Abbas, the Iranian railway was connected only with Bandar Imam Khomeini and Khorramshahr in the south -- which is not very active -- and Torkaman Port in the north, which again is among inactive ports. "Fortunately, by connecting the railway with Bandar Abbas, a good network has been formed. Also with the opening of the Sarakhs-Mashhad route, transportation through Iran has become more vital." "We hope that with the activation of Amir-Abad Port, a new and important corridor called the 'North-South Corridor' will be inaugurated, and transportation from Russia and the Caspian Sea to Iran, and from Iran to all points in Southeast Asia and regional countries will be inaugurated. "How would you assess the role of governments in the development of international transportation?" Chief Executive of UIC, Philippe Roumeguere, said, "All of them, of course, are very important for crossing the borders. We needed some legal agreements, and by that fact it is a success to have so many transportation ministers, diplomatic, legal and customs agreements... If you solve the question of tariffs, we can be perfect and harmonized." "How would you assess rail transportation by the Iranian railway system and the International Railway Union?" "If you look at a map you can obviously see the importance of Iran in this region. Iranian railways are very active members of UIC, they have all the implementations, all the new techniques. I was here four years ago; I can see all the progress in linking Europe to China. You can imagine the future of that!" Kabibollah Jacopof, deputy minister of transportation of Kazakhstan, said, "According to its geographic situation in the region, each country plays a role. One cannot expect any country to have a greater or lesser role than its importance." "In so far as such a conference held at such a level in Tehran and the important countries that have participated, it shows that Iran plays a significant role in policymaking of the International Railway Union." He assessed relations between Iran and Kazakhstan as very positive. "I hope we will soon witness rails which will carry freight and passengers from Kazakhstan to Iran. Kazakhstan at present lays great importance on issues relating to the development of corridors which transfer cargo first to Russia and the Balkans; secondly to China and the Far East; and thirdly to Iran and Central Asia. In each of the three directions international corridors have been determined and, therefore, various possibilities in ground and sea transportation exist." "Since Kazakhstan is situated in the center of the continent, it has a duty to take on important responsibilities. It can play an important role in creating relations between Far Eastern countries and Europe and be able to reduce expenses and distances, and create maximum comfort for passengers. The Kazakh government has made this a duty for transportation officials." Mr. Jacopof thanked those who held the conference and praised its quality.
