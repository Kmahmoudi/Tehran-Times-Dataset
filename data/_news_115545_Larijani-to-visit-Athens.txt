The talks with Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis were requested by Larijani, who was on a visit to the Turkish capital Ankara Monday, the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement. "The Iranians are interested in coming to Greece because it is currently a temporary member of the UN Security Council and a governor of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," a Greek diplomatic source said. On April 25, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Athens seeking Greek support for putting pressure on Tehran to renounce its nuclear program. Bakoyannis has stressed that the Greek position on the Iran nuclear standoff would be determined after "prior European coordination". Larijani will return to Tehran after his visit to Greece, the Iranian embassy in Athens told AFP.
