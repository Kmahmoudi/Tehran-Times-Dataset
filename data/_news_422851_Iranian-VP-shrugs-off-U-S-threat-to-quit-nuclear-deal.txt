TEHRAN - Iranian First Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Saturday that “nothing will happen” to Iran if the Trump administration goes ahead with its threat to abrogate the 2015 nuclear deal.
 “The U.S. assumes that Iran will face serious problem if it withdraw from the deal while we are ready for any situation and have no concern,” he said at the convention of senior government officials. “We have planning for management of the country and without the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] nothing will happen to the country,” the vice president stated. U.S. President Donald Trump announced in a statement on January 12 that the Europeans have only 120 days to agree to an overhaul of the nuclear agreement and said if the text of the nuclear deal is not revised he would unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from it. Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the U.S., UK, France, Russia, and China - Germany and the European Union struck the nuclear deal in July 2015. The deal took effect in January 2016. ‘People are committed to the system’ Jahangiri also said that the people are committed to the Islamic Republic system and have helped it in critical times. Jahangiri made the remarks in an open reference to former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who has claimed that the people will revolt against the officials. He said that efforts are being made to make the people “disappointed” about the future, saying that unity should be strengthened. “We should follow national dialogues aiming at boosting unity in the society,” he suggested. He said that problems can be solved through “national integrity”. NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
