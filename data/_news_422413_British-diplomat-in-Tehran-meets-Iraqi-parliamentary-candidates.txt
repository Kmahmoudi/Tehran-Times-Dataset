TEHRAN - Nicholas Hopton, the British ambassador to Tehran, has met separately with a number of Iraqis competing for the May parliamentary elections.
 “Useful discussions in Baghdad with some of the candidates in Iraq’s upcoming elections,” he tweeted on Friday. He held meetings with President of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq Ammar al-Hakim, Vice President Nouri al-Maliki and Hadi al-Amiri, a former transportation minister. British Ambassador to Iraq Jon Wilkis also attended the meetings. Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Iraq on May 12. The elections decide the 329 members of the Council of Representatives who will in turn elect the Iraqi President and Prime Minister. Hopton has been in office since 2016 and reportedly he will be replaced by another envoy soon.
