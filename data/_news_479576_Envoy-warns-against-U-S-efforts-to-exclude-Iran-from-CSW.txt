TEHRAN- Iran's ambassador to the United Nations on Friday cautioned against the United States' attempts to remove Iran as a member of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). Amir Saeid Iravani made the comments in a letter on Friday to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, UN Economic and Social Council President Lachezara Stoeva, and UN Commission on the Status of Women Chair Mathu Joyini. In a post on Twitter on Dec. 5, U.S. ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, “The Iranian government should not be on the @UN_CSW – an international body dedicated to promoting gender equality and women's empowerment. Removing Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women is the right thing to do." A draft resolution proposed by the United States, regarding the removal of Iran from the commission, will be up for a vote at the UN later this month. The full text of Iravani’s letter is as follows: I am writing to you with reference to the upcoming meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) scheduled for 14 December 2022, wherein the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations proposed a request in a letter dated 16 November 2022 addressed to the President of the Economic and Social Council to discuss its illegal request to terminate Iran's membership in the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) based solely on false allegations and fabricated assumptions made against my Country. This illegitimate request indicates yet another attempt by the United States to exploit the UN system to further its political agenda. The Islamic Republic of Iran has already warned against the politicization and abuse of UN bodies for the advancement of certain political objectives, which will ultimately damage the credibility of the UN system. You are aware, Your Excellency, of the U.S.’ hostile policies as well as its comprehensive campaign against the Islamic Republic of Iran, including its maximum economic and political pressures, especially after the U.S.’ withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018. However, when it comes to the UN system, such illegal action, if accomplished, would be very dangerous for the UN System's integrity. It might create not only a disastrous precedent with further implications but also defy the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter, including its core concept of sovereign equality of States in membership with meaningful participation in all international fora as well as representation of all international bodies by all states equally, proportionately and based on the geographical distribution of representatives from all regions of the world. These have been recognized as the foundational pillars of the UN System and multilateralism. In the meantime, there is no precedence in the Council's practice of terminating an elected member's membership in a functional Commission for any purported reason, nor is it supported by the Council's rule of procedures. In light of the foregoing, I kindly urge Your Excellency, in your capacity as the UN Charter's custodian based on the responsibilities entrusted to the Secretary-General therein, to protect and preserve its principles. In this regard, this includes by preventing such unconstructive and destructive attempts orchestrated by the United States, the result of which would not only jeopardize the active and inclusive participation of all member states in the UN activities but also result in other unexpected consequences that I have forewarned of above. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the United Nations Economic and Social Council under Agenda Item 4, elections, nominations, confirmations, and appointments. Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
