TEHRAN â€“ Reforestation will be conducted on 1,250 hectares of 1,800 meter altitude of central mountain range of Alborz, to prevent illegal constructions and land grabbing in mountainous areas, head of Tehran Parks and Green Space Organization, affiliated to the municipality has said. The project will be implemented concurrent with the National Tree Planting Day, in which people are encouraged to plant trees across the country, to be held on the first day of the National Week of Natural Resources annually observed on March 6 to 13. Reforestation measures will be carried out on the southern skirts of the Alborz mountains which are over 1,800 meters high, as a solution to avoid land grabbing or illegal construction, Ali Mohammad Mokhtari said, Fars reported on Tuesday. Trees located in mountains, are effective in reducing air pollution and better at absorbing emissions acting like a filter, he added.

Most of the plant species being cultivated on the mountainous areas are drought resistant and mostly indigenous, he concluded.
