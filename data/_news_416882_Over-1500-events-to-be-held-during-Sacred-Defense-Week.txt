TEHRAN – The head of the Foundation for Preservation of Sacred Defense Works and Values said on Sunday that more than 1500 events will be held during the Sacred Defense Week, which will begin on Shahrivar 31 (September 22). Brigadier General Bahman Kargar said that this year’s Sacred Defense Week coincides with the mourning days of Muharram, IRIB news reported. “The Sacred Defense has a deep connection with Ashura (the day Husayn ibn Ali, Shia Muslims’ third Imam, was martyred),” he said. Iranians refer to resistance against Iraq’s invasion of Iran in the 1980s as sacred defense.
