Political turmoil in the United States has become extremely unpredictable. The turn of events became worse with an op-ed at the New York Times on September 5. Former White House strategist Steve Bannon described it as a coup against Donald Trump. The reality is that the president faces domestic problems in his second year in office. This has rarely happened in the U.S. political history. The issue is of great importance with regard to the approaching mid-term congressional elections in November. Republicans has the majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate, but they feel the risk of losing the majority in both houses due to Trump’s record. Indeed, a feeling has emerged among some American politicians that their country is heading in the wrong direction because of Trump's policies. Even former President Barack Obama has joined the election campaigns by breaking his promise not to get involved in political affairs.  The situation is not also good for Trump internationally. Disagreement with the European Union - a traditional ally of the United States - over trade and political issues, trade war with China, increasing tension with Russia, exit from international treaties such as the Paris climate agreement and the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement Iran, have all made Trump to look dangerous in the eyes of the world. All these issues have made the situation unfavorable for Trump and his government at home and abroad. But what is the answer of the president of the United States to these criticisms? The answer to this question is one word: economy. However, Trump is proud of his economic record. According to statistics, the Labor Department published on September 8, US employment growth in August has beat market expectations, the non-farm payrolls increased by 201,000 from the previous month. Analysts were expecting growth of about 195,000. The unemployment rate for August remained low at 3.9 percent. The average hourly wage rose 2.9 percent from the year before. That's the highest level since June 2009. The latest figures are increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise its key interest rate this month. The US economy expanded 4.2 percent in the April-to-June quarter, and is expected to grow more than 3 percent in this quarter. But the economy cannot keep the president of the United States from the edge of criticism. Trump is in a difficult situation and worried about the result of the election and possible control of Congress by Democrats. Issues such as the confessions of Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen on bribing women for having affairs with Trump and Russia's possible involvement in the 2016 presidential election could possibly lead to his impeachment and his dismissal from power. The U.S. constitution says that the impeachment of the president should be endorsed by representatives from both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats now have 49 seats in the 100-member Senate, and if they get 51 seats in the November election, they will still need at least 15 Republican senators to impeach Trump. Still, if Democrats win the November election, even if this victory does not lead to Trump's impeachment, it can put further pressure on him and cripple his government. According to a CNN poll, decrease in Trump’s popularity even among his supporters shows that the days following the November election will be hard times for Trump and his government.
