TEHRAN – Iran’s justice minister has raised voice against presidential candidates who make slogans which may undermine the country’s progress, saying, “The nation will not allow a candidate weaken the country.”

 Speaking to reporters in Tehran on Monday, Mostafa Pourmohammadi said, “It is a thing of the law of the jungle to try to knock down your rival at any cost.”  “We are not going to imitate [candidates in other countries]. Elections are meant to be indicative of our human capacities,” ISNA quoted him as saying. SP/PA
