TEHRAN – On Wednesday, the day marking the 9th of the calendar month of Muharram, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on his tweeter page that Imam Hussein’s resistance against injustice sends the unwavering message that “standing up for justice yields victory”.
 “14 centuries have passed since Karbala saw epic martyrdom of Imam Hussein in his seemingly unequal resistance against tyranny. His sacrifice carries unwavering & ever relevant message: standing up for justice yields victory: 'Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala' #YaHussein,” Zarif wrote. Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (S), stood against Yazid, a tyrant from the Ummayad dynasty. Imam Hussein, along with 72 loyalists, were martyred in the battle of Karbala in 680 CE.
