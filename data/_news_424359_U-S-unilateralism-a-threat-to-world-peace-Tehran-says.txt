TEHRAN – Iran has responded to the final statement from the G7, saying the U.S. government’s insistence on unilateral measures is a “threat” to international peace and security. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday that the Islamic Republic advises the G7 countries to avoid falling for the Iranophobic policies of “certain insatiable countries and regimes.” Iran has shown to be more concerned about world peace and security than the G7 countries and has paid a high price in fighting terrorist groups such as Daesh (ISIL), Qassemi added.
