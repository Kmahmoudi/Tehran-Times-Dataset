TEHRAN — A significant portion of Iran's blocked assets will be released following a new agreement, IRNA reported on Wednesday, citing a well-informed source.  The recent agreement to release Iran's assets has nothing to do with the JCPOA (the 2015 nuclear deal), and is the second major foreign exchange opening in recent weeks, the source added.  So far, the central bank has remained silent on the report.
