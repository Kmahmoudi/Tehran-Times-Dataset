TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday that Tehran puts “highest value” on relations with African countries.
 Zarif made the remarks after he held talks with the Senegalese president, foreign minister and parliament speaker in Dakar on Thursday.  “In Dakar, #Senegal, on fourth leg of trip after visiting the UN and the Americas. Held important talks with President @Macky_Sall, FM @amadou_ba_, and Parliament Spkr @MoustaphaNiasse on bilateral relations; emphasizing highest value we put on relations with African nations,” Zarif tweeted.
