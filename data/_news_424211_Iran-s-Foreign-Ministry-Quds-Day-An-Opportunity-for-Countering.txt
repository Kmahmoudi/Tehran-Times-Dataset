TEHRAN – Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on all Muslim and freedom-advocating people worldwide to attend anti-Israeli rallies on the International Quds Day, which it described as an opportunity for opposing Israel’s policy of occupation, apartheid, massacre and creating crisis.  As Muslims around the world are going to hold pro-Palestinian demonstrations tomorrow, the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan known as the International Quds Day, Iran’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement in support of the initiative, calling for worldwide condemnation of Israeli measures. The following is the text of the statement, released by the Foreign Ministry’s website: In the Name of God; The International Quds Day, which is annually held on the last Friday of Ramadan based on the lasting initiative announced by Imam Khomeini nearly 40 years ago, has turned into an opportunity to promote global unity against the Zionist usurper regime’s occupation, apartheid, and massacre, and its moves to create division and crisis. The Zionist usurper regime has a 70-year history of occupation, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the occupied territories, repeated and shameless violation of international rules, regulations, and law, displacement of Palestinians and Judaization of the occupied territories, slaughter of innocent Palestinians, particularly women, children, and even relief forces, invasion and violation of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighboring countries, spreading lies against the countries that support the innocent people of Palestine, and supporting terrorist groups with the aim of destabilizing regional countries. There is no doubt that fight against the policies and plots of such a regime requires the unity and support of all Muslim governments and nations and the countries in which the spirit of seeking freedom and justice is still alive. During the past few months and in line with its 70-year history of aggression and occupation, the Zionist regime has not hesitated to commit any shameless crime in the occupied territories of Palestine. The US government has also endorsed these crimes by relocating its embassy to the holy Quds. Such circumstances have turned this year’s Quds Day into one of the most sensitive periods of time in history as far as the issue of Palestine is concerned. This day can provide a glorious and golden opportunity to support the innocent and oppressed people of Palestine and their legitimate struggles. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran calls on all Muslim and free nations of the world, particularly the dignified, resilient, and pro-justice nation of Iran, to attend the International Quds Day rallies on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan.
