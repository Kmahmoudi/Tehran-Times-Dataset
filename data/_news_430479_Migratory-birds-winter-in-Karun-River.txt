Migratory birds have winged their ways to Karun River, southwestern province of Khuzestan, once again this year.Â 

 The area is hosting various bird species including large white-headed gulls, herons, and cormorants every year with the onset of cold seasons. The birds normally will stay until late April. Over the past few years low precipitation amounts and long-term drought spells have resulted in decreased population of migratory birds.
