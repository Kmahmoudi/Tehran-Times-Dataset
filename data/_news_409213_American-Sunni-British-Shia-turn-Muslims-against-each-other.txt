TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that the “American Sunni” and “British Shia” are the two blades of the same scissors who turn Muslims against one another, Khaemeni.ir reported. The Leader made the remarks on the occasion of the birth anniversaries of Prophet Muhammad and Imam Ja'far al-Sadeq's (PBUT), addressing heads of government branches, a group of state officials, and invitees to the 30th International Unity Conference. He accused the United Kingdom of attempting, for decades, to foment discord among nations, saying, “For centuries, Britain has been the source of wickedness and evil among regional nations: the strikes that these Britons have blown against the lives of our neighbors are incomparable to others. In Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq as well as in Palestine, in which they have committed a vicious act by forcing the entire nation off their homeland. Now, the same Britain, shamelessly, claims that Iran is a threat to the region.” Ayatollah Khamenei added, “The old British policy of divide and rule is being pursued.” The Leader of the revolution stressed the importance of unity among Muslim nations, saying, “Today the Muslim world is suffering major plights and the solution is Islamic unity. If we are united and if we move in union towards the achievement of Islamic goals, the United States of America and the malicious Zionist network can no longer impose their wills on Muslims.” He continued, “Today two wills are opposing one another in this region: one is the will of unity, and the other is the will of discord.  “If unity is realized, the situation would not be as it is today, and Muslims could gain more dignity. Presently, Muslims from Myanmar to Africa are being massacred; some are killed by Boko Haram and some by the hands of a few Buddhists.” He also advised Muslims to “read all Quranic verses about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH): it is a comprehensive collection. The problem with what we do is that we neglect the divine teachings. If we pay attention to this comprehensive collection, then the right path will appear before us.” The Leader described the arrogant powers’ increased efforts against Islam, particularly after the Islamic Revolution, as a sign of fear towards the establishment and consolidation of a mighty Islamic system, which would serve as an ideal model and pioneering method for other nations.  “The enemies — even if they claim to pursue flexibility, and even if they appear fine — from within they are indeed aggressive and violent; thus, nations must prepare themselves to confront their immoral, disbelieving, and unjust enemies,” he added. Ayatollah Khamenei further said that unity is the most important form of preparation that the Muslim world needs. “All Islamic denominations—whether Shia or Sunni—should avoid creating discord; and they should regard the noble and beloved prophet (PBUH), the holy Quran, and the Holy Ka’aba as the axis of unity and solidarity amongst themselves,” he emphasized. The Supreme Leader called on the Muslim people and governments to be vigilant in the face of the domineering powers' conspiracies.  “Why do [certain] countries with an Islamic appearance accept the words of the enemies about the threats and the intra-animosity within the Islamic world, and openly obey their policies?” the Leader asked.
 
“Continuation of the prideful path of Imam Khomeini and the revolution, resistance against the enemies, and fearless defense of truth and the right will, undoubtedly, bring about dignity and prosperity, in this world and the next,” said Ayatollah Khamenei, addressing the Iranian nation.
