TEHRAN – French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will visit Iran next week, the British Broadcasting Corporation said on Tuesday, quoting an informed source. The trip was scheduled to take place in January 2018 but it was postponed for some reasons, the report said. In the course of his visit to Iran, French Foreign Minister Le Drian will inaugurate an exhibition dubbed “Louvre Museum in Tehran-Treasures of French National Collections” as well. Concurrent with the Louver exhibition in Tehran, it is supposed that an exhibition of Iranian art works of the Qajar era would be held in France as well, the report added.
