TEHRAN – Some regional countries have spoken out against Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement. A Qatari Foreign Ministry official said except for a few countries, the world responded to Trump’s decision with “rationality”, “wisdom” and “restraint”, ISNA reported. Kuwaiti Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled al-Jarallah said Kuwait “welcomed the agreement, because it contributes to the achievement of security and stability in the region. The existence of this agreement is better than no agreement.” Oman’s Foreign Ministry also issued a statement, saying it will "follow-up on this development".
