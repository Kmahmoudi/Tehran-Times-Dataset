TEHRAN – A member of the Criminal Content Definition Task Force has rejected rumors of banning Instagram, saying there has been no discussions about blocking Instagram within any of the responsible bodies. “Recently, individuals who have no official responsibility in the area of cyberspace and relevant areas have made statements about social networks, especially Instagram, which have been perceived by the public as banning this network, while this is not the case at all,” Ramazan Ali Sobhanifar said, ISNA reported on Monday. Sobhanifar added that Iran's prosecutor general has also rejected any talks about blocking social networks.
