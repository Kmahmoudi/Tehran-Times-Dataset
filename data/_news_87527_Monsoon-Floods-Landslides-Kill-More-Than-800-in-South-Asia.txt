Millions more people have been left homeless by floods in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, while many parts of India are suffering the worst drought in 15 years, More than 20,000 people were left homeless by fresh floods in Manipur, senior flood control official Dhaneswar Singh told AFP from the state capital Imphal, AFP reported. "The flood situation is very critical with four out of nine districts badly hit. Three persons were drowned, including a child, on Tuesday," he said. Floodwaters have submerged several areas on the outskirts of Imphal forcing thousands of people to take shelter on raised platforms, the official said. "Most of the rivers in the state are flowing above the danger level and threatening to burst embankments," Singh said. "There are unconfirmed reports about many people missing in the Chandel district while trying to escape the floods." At least 68 people have been killed in floods and landslides in Assam, Mizoram, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh states in the northeast since July. More than five million people have been left homeless in Assam alone, and the flood situation in the state continues to be grim with at least two eastern districts under water. "People in thousands are still unable to return to their homes with floodwaters surrounding their villages," north Lakhmipur District Magistrate Longki Phangsu told AFP. A central water commission bulletin Wednesday said the Brahmaputra River was flowing above the danger level in at least seven places. In the hill state of Uttaranchal, 33 people died in a landslide caused by torrential rain on Sunday, while eight people were killed in a landslide in Bombay last week. In the capital New Delhi, two children killed Tuesday by debris when a house collapsed in India due to heavy monsoon rains. The death toll from a month of flooding in the eastern state of Bihar has risen 279, officials said, and heavy rains are continuing. "Army men have taken up relief and rescue works and helicopters have started dropping food packets Tuesday," said Arvind Kumar Chowdhary, the magistrate of one of the affected districts, Khagaria. "The rising trend in rivers is a cause of concern as it mounts pressure on embankments. The district administration and irrigation officials are busy repairing the damaged embankments," Water Resource Department officials said. In Nepal, the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies said 422 people had died this monsoon season. The Home Ministry put the toll at 344, with 70 missing. In Bangladesh three children were killed on Tuesday when their home was buried in a landslide in the southeastern Bangladesh port city of Chittagong, police said. But floodwaters, which have left up to seven million people homeless, were receding, officials said. The latest floods follow heavy rains which claimed some 176 lives in the western Indian districts of Thane and Bombay between April and June. 
