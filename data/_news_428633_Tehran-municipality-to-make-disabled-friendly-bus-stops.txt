According to Hossein Nahvinejad, deputy director for Iran’s Welfare Organization rehabilitation affairs, the law will be fully implemented by the next Iranian calendar year starting on March 21, 2019.  One of the articles of the law aims to create an environment in which people with disability can have an equal chance of accessing social facilities as normal people. People with multiple disabilities can use public transportation– including buses and subway – free of charge. Head of Iran’s Welfare Organization Anoushirvan Mohseni-Bandpey said in mid-July that the government has allocated a total budget of 2 trillion rials (nearly $47 million) for implementing the law on rights of persons with disabilities. But Nahvinejad said on Monday that in order for the law to go into effect fully the Welfare Organization require a budget of 120 trillion rials (nearly $2.8 billion). Looking around the city it is clear the Tehran is not much disability-friendly and it’s already too late. This doesn’t solely concern one organization. There are number of responsible bodies which have to join hands in both allocating the necessary budget as well as developing necessary infrastructure to the city a better place for people who are already making a great effort to live a better life.
