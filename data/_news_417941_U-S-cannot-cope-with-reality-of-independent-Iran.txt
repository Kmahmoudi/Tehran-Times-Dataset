TEHRAN – Iran's Ambassador to London, Hamid Baeidinejad, has said Washington’s problem is that it cannot cope with the reality of an independent Iran, ISNA reported on Wednesday.

 In a conference on the future of the Iran nuclear deal hosted by the British parliament on Tuesday, Baeidinejad denounced U.S. President Donald Trump’s anti-Iran rhetoric, saying the U.S. has once again resorted to the failed policy of regime change in Iran. “The central problem in the U.S. is that its officials have never wanted to accept the facts, and therefore they have not recognized the Islamic Revolution, Iran's government, and people's demands, and, unfortunately, this approach is now ongoing in the White House,” IRNA quoted Baeidinejad as saying. In reference to Iran’s role in fighting terrorism, the ambassador said his country has paid a high price for the stability of the region. “Iran has compensated for the West’s strategic mistakes [in the region],” he said. The ambassador added that Daesh (ISIS) would have taken Baghdad and Damascus by now if it had not been for Iran’s active role in helping Syria and Iraq fight the terrorist group. As a Middle Eastern country, he said, Iran’s only concern is the region’s peace and stability. Instability in neighboring countries would mean instability in Iran, he added. He also pointed to the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, saying the deal is stronger than being challenged by the U.S. administration. “The Trump administration, ignoring the record and content of the nuclear talks, insists the wrong interpretation that with the JCPOA implementation, Iran was expected to curb its missile capabilities and stop its regional influence, while the issues have not been included in the nuclear negotiations,” stated Baeidinejad who was involved in the nuclear talks with the 5+1 group. On October 13, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would not recertify that Tehran is complying with the 2015 nuclear agreement despite repeated reports by the IAEA to the contrary. He also threatened to withdraw from the accord. MH/PA
