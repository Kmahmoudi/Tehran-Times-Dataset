TEHRAN - British citizens are dissatisfied with the talks between Theresa May, the U.K Prime Minister, and the European Union over Brexit. The discontent can be seen in most surveys conducted in the country. Some surveys show that around 60 percent of British citizens are dissatisfied with the exit from the EU and believe that Theresa May can't be a proper negotiator for it.
  However, May continues her apparent activities negotiating with other European leaders. Obviously, British authorities are trying to look serious in leaving the European Union. But at the same time, they're creating distress and concerns in their society about the effects and consequences of Brexit. It should be noted that some like former Prime Minister Tony Blair are trying to exaggerate the cost of leaving Europe, and thus encouraging them to hold a second referendum on Brexit. Some analysts of European affairs believe that there has probably been a deal between European leaders and the British government in this regard.
 Accordingly, the European authorities' insistence on Britain changing its decision (on leaving the EU) is not without a reason. Furthermore, many British authorities actually agree with this reversal notion. In recent days, European authorities have insisted on their stance to hold stricter negotiations on London's exit from the European Union.  On the other hand, some British authorities have explicitly stated that they are not satisfied with the negotiation process, and there is virtually no clarity about prospects for these talks. But the issue doesn't just end here. European leaders have clearly stated that London can change its decision on Brexit and remain in the European Union.
Theresa May, of course, has stated that her country's decision to leave the EU is unchangeable. Although no one knows what's really going on in the May’s mind, the question remains: Are Theresa May, Tony Blair and the European authorities cooperating in completing the same puzzle in secret? There are some other points that also should be taken into consideration. Tony Blair has called for a revision to Brexit. This idea was welcomed by some other British politicians. Although May government has apparently opposed holding another referendum over Brexit, it is clear to everyone that she was one of the proponents of Britain's remaining in the European Union during the 2016 referendum.  All these factors indicate that the Brexit puzzle is arranged in a different way (contrary to what was initially thought). Accordingly, it is likely that London and the EU have secretly agreed on Britain remaining in the United Europe, and are now seeking to provide the grounds for executing this agreement and to manage British public opinion, too.  In the recent polls conducted in the UK, most citizens have opposed Brexit. This change of opinion is the result of a propaganda campaign led by British politicians warning the society about the threats and consequences of Brexit. At the same time, and as mentioned above, the talks are not well underway and the possibility of success in the negotiations is perhaps unlikely. In any case, Brexit negotiations should end by 2019.
