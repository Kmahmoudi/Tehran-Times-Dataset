TEHRAN - Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an Iranian lawmaker, said on Monday that the U.S. sanctions against Iran provide an opportunity to expand interaction with other countries, particularly China.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to expand comprehensive relations with China. There are very good capacities to expand relations in various areas of economy, politics, and culture,” he said during a meeting with China’s Ambassador to Tehran Pang Sen. Boroujerdi attached great importance to the role of parliaments in expanding relations. He also noted that Iran is ready to cooperate with Beijing and welcomes investment by China in industrial and economic projects. For his part, Pang said that China is interested in deepening relations with Iran and increasing investment in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from the nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran.  The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on Monday, August 6. The second batch will be restored on November 4. CNBC reported on August 8 that China condemned the measures reinstated against Tehran and urged oil and gas firms to reject calls for them to completely cut off from Iranian crude. “China’s commercial cooperation with Iran is open and transparent, reasonable, fair and lawful, not violating any United Nations Security Council resolutions,” China’s Foreign Ministry said.
