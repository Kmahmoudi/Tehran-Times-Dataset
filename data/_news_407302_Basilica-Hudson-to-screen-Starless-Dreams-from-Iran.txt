TEHRAN – Iranian director Mehrdad Oskui’s “Starless Dreams” will go on screen in Basilica Hudson, a non-profit multidisciplinary arts center in Hudson, NY, supporting the creation, production and presentation of arts and culture. The film will be screened on October 20 in the Basilica non-fiction screening series section co-curated with Chris Boeckmann of True/False Film Fest, the organizers have announced on the website. A haunting portrait of stolen childhood, “Starless Dreams” plunges us into the lives of seven young teenage girls sharing temporary quarters at a rehabilitation and correction center on the outskirts of Tehran.  Founded in 2010 by musician Melissa Auf der Maur and filmmaker Tony Stone, Basilica Hudson makes its home in a spectacular solar-powered reclaimed 1880s industrial factory on the waterfront of the historic City of Hudson.
