TEHRAN – The Intelligence Ministry said on Monday that its forces have dismantled three major fuel-smuggling cartels in Marvdasht, Kazerun and Lamerd counties in the southern Fars province, Mehr reported. In a statement, the Intelligence Ministry announced that the cartels were involved in smuggling 17 million liters of fuel, such as petrol and diesel, selling their consignments to foreign elements on the other side of the border in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The statement added that five key members of the cartel were arrested during the operation. The devaluation of Iran’s national currency in recent months has turned fuel smuggling to a lucrative business.
