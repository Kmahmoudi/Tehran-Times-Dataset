TEHRAN – The interim Friday prayer preacher of Tehran has warned authorities against repeating the failed experience of the 2015 nuclear deal by joining the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Mehr reported. Addressing worshippers in Tehran on Friday, Hojatoleslam Kazem Seddiqi likened joining the FATF to “self-sanctioning”, saying that signing the related bills will reveal the country’s financial information to the enemies. “This is contrary to the text of the Quran, the constitution, and the guidance of the Leader of Islamic Revolution who said that these plans are being hatched in the think tanks of the hegemons,” Seddiqi added.
