TEHRAN – Iran’s ambassador to Turkey told a news conference on Wednesday that “extremists should not be allowed” to undermine interaction between Iran, Russia and Turkey to settle the crisis in Syria. “Constructive dialogue between us (Iran) and Turkey, and also between Turkey and Russia on issues of mutual interest is going on, and therefore extremists should not be allowed to interfere (in it),” Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian Fard said two days after the Russian ambassador in Turkey was shot dead. Elsewhere in his remarks, he said Iran is resolute to stay by Turkey’s side in harsh circumstances, including after the assassination of the Russian ambassador and earlier when Ankara escaped a coup.
