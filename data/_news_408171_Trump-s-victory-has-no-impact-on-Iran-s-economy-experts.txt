TEHRAN- The chairman of Iran’s Securities and Exchange Organization (SEO) Shapour Mohammadi and the head of Tehran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines, and Agriculture (TCCIMA) Masoud Khansari have said that the election of Donald Trump as the new U.S. President will have no specific impact on Iran’s economy. As Mohammadi told ILNA, external factors including Trump’s presidency cannot have a notable influence on Iran's positive economic growth as well as the country’s capital market in the long-run, thanks to the current stability of its interior economic conditions.  Addressing the same issue, Khansari told Tasnim news agency that Iran’s economy will not be impressed by other country’s conditions and the Islamic Republic can be safe from external factors via holding its national unity.
