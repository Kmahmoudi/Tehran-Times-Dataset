TEHRAN – Behrooz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, has said that Iran is capable of completing the redesigned Arak reactor even in a “worst-case scenario”. Dismissing rumors about disruptions in the redesigning of the Arak the nuclear reactor now that the U.S. has pulled out of the nuclear agreement, Kamalvandi said the rumors were spread by some foreign media outlets in order to cast doubt on the future of Iran’s cooperation with other countries, ISNA reported on Friday. “Even in a worst case scenario regarding BARJAM (the Persian acronym for the nuclear agreement), for example if Iran was accused of violating BARJAM and the 5+1 states took the case to the [UN] Security Council, according to article 14 of Resolution 2231, the previous agreements such as Iran’s agreement with China with regard to the Arak [reactor] would not be subject to [new] sanctions,” he stated. Kamalvandi also said it is possible that the U.S. government tries to pressure other countries by imposing unilateral sanctions, but it is unlikely that “a country like China would act in accordance with America without a United Nations Security Council resolution.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
