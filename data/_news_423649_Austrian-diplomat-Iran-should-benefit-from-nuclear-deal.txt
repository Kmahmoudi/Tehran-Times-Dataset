TEHRAN – The Austrian Ambassador to Iran, Stefan Scholz, said on Wednesday that Vienna respects the 2015 nuclear deal as long as Iran continues to remain committed to its obligations.
 During a meeting with Majid Khodabakhsh, governor of East Azerbaijan Province, Scholz said that Iran should benefit from the nuclear deal.  Since President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal on May 9, Iran has threatened if the other members of the agreement, especially Europeans, do not give “guarantees” to Tehran about the benefits of the agreement it will remove cap on its nuclear activities.
