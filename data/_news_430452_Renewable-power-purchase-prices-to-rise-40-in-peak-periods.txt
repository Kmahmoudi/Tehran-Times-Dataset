TEHRAN - Seyed Mohammad Sadeqzadeh, head of Iran’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (known as SATBA), said the Energy Ministry is going to increase the guaranteed purchase prices for renewable electricity generation during the year’s first six months when the consumption is higher. According to the official there are over 85,000 big scale renewable power plants and more than 2000 small scale ones are currently active across the country, IRIB reported on Sunday. Sadeqzadeh noted that over 80 percent of the country’s solar and wind electricity output is generated during the mentioned six months. Earlier in August, Sadeqzadeh said that the country’s total capacity of generating electricity from renewable resources will reach 1100 megawatts (MW) by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019). Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence in the regional electricity market.
