Siemens has been awarded a contract by Hampa Engineering to supply 12 compressor trains for two onshore natural gas processing plants in Iran. Under the contract, the company will supply compressor trains each comprising a Siemens STC-SV vertical split compressor for the processing plants, which will be operated by Palayesh Parsian Sepehr. Siemens Iran CEO Mohsen Nayebzadeh said: "Siemens has been present in Iran since 1868, maintaining a significant local operation. This is the first huge oil and gas order since the easing of sanctions in January 2016. “Our best-in-class technology and our reliable expertise in the Iranian oil and gas business will help the Iranian people develop a sustainable, affordable, and modern electrification system.” Of the 12 trains, ten will be used for the Mohr C2+ hydrocarbon recovery plant, located in Fars Province in south-central Iran. The plant is designed to process natural gas into C2+ hydrocarbons. Hampa Engineering Corporation managing director Hamid Elyas said: "Siemens is a partner that has all the capabilities necessary to execute such a huge scope of supply, such as the 12 compressor trains for the C2 recovery and fractionation project.” Siemens said that four of the ordered STC-SV compressors will be driven by SGT-700 gas turbines to provide high OPEX benefit. Additionally, four other compressor trains for the Mohr plant will be driven by Siemens SGT-100 gas turbines while two others will be driven by an electric motor. Part of the hydrocarbons produced at Mohr plant will be delivered to the domestic Iranian gas market while the long-chained hydrocarbons will be transported in a pipeline to the Iranian coast. The hydrocarbons will be further fractionated to produce important feed stock at the Assaluyeh plant in Bushehr Province for the petrochemical industry, including ethane, propane, and butane. The order also calls for the supply of two other compressor trains for Assaluyeh plant. Each of the compressors will be driven by a Siemens SST-600 steam turbine.
