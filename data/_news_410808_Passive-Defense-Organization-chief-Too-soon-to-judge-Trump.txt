TEHRAN – “I am not going to make a judgment about the new president of America and will rather wait until he takes his measures and his strategies are determined,” Iran’s Passive Defense Organization commander said on Sunday. Gholamreza Jalali made the statement in response to a question about a bill in the U.S. Congress on an authorization for the country’s president to use military force against Iran, Fars reported.  The bill “to authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces to achieve the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons” was put forth by Alcee Hastings in January.
