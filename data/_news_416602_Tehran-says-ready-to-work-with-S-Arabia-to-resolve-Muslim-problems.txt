TEHRAN – The Iranian foreign minister has said his country is ready to work with Saudi Arabia to help resolve the problems facing Muslims in the Middle East and the larger world.

 “We are ready to cooperate with Islamic countries on all issues that is important to the Islamic world,” Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview with the Arabic-language Al Mayadeen TV network aired on Tuesday. “Saudi Arabia is an important Islamic country and therefore, we are prepared to work with the country to address the problem of the Rohingya Muslims,” he said. Zarif also emphasized that Tehran is ready to cooperate with Riyadh to help end regional crises, including the Syrian conflict, crackdown in Bahrain and the “irrational and costly” war on Yemen. Relations between Tehran and Riyadh have strained over the past years after their conflicting views on regional developments, particularly on Yemen and Syria, became more noticeable. The relations further deteriorated after a crush of pilgrims in Mina, near Saudi Arabia’s Mecca, in September 2015, which reportedly killed over 7000 Hajj pilgrims, including 464 Iranians. Tehran blamed the deaths on the Saudi government’s mismanagement. Iran has also been criticizing Riyadh for “lack of cooperation” on restoring the rights of families of the victims. SP/PA
