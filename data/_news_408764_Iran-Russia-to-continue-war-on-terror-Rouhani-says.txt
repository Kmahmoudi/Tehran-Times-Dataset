TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that Iran and Russia will continue cooperation in fighting terrorism until it is eradicated.
 “There is good cooperation between Tehran and Moscow in this respect [fighting terrorism] which will continue until the final objective, which is eradication of terrorism and establishment of peace and stability in the region, is reached,” he said during a meeting with Alexander Lavrentiev, the Russian president’s special envoy for the Middle East. Rouhani described terrorism as a “serious threat” to the world and highlighted the necessity of Iran-Russia cooperation in countering terrorism in the Middle East. He also said that the crisis in Syria can be settled only through holding “political negotiation”, “respecting the people’s will” and “protecting the country’s territorial integrity”. The president said no efforts should be spared in sending aid to civilians caught in the Syrian war. Elsewhere, he expressed satisfaction over the current level of relations with Moscow, saying cooperation between the two countries benefits regional peace and stability. Rouhani also said that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the official name for the nuclear deal between Iran and its international partners, is in line with guarding international peace and security. And all sides should make efforts in implementing the deal and no country must be allowed to undermine the international agreement, the president asserted  “Iran has always been and will be committed to its international obligations (under the deal) and all the 5+1 group’s member states should also fulfil their obligations,” he insisted. The nuclear deal between Iran and the six major powers (the U. S., Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany) went into effect in January. For his part, Lavrentiev said Russia has a fixed stance on the JCPOA, adding there is no reason to undermine the nuclear deal. He called for further cooperation between Iran and Russia on regional issues and said that Russian President Vladimir Putin attaches value to “trust” between the two countries. ‘Iran-Russia ties should continue growing’ In a separate meeting with the Russian envoy, Ali Akbar Velayati, the senior foreign policy advisor to the Leader, said relations between Tehran and Moscow “should always be on the rise”.  “The new situation which has been created in the world reminds us that relations between Iran and Russia should always be growing,” Velayati suggested. He described situation in the region as “volatile” and called for increasing efforts to counter threats.
