TEHRAN - Iran has scrapped visa-free entry for Serbian nationals, days after the Balkan country reintroduced visas for Iranians, CHTN reported on Thursday. The practice will be mutually implemented followed by Serbia’s recent suspension of visa waiver for Iranian citizens, the Foreign Ministry’s passport office announced in a statement. On October 10, Serbia announced it would terminate visa-free entries for Iranians out of concerns that some may “abuse the system” as an avenue to enter other European states. In August 2017, Serbia abolished visas for Iranians in a move to boost tourism, improve growth and reach out to non-European markets. Serbia received over 15,000 Iranian nationals since the visa-waiver program came into effect.
