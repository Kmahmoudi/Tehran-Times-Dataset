TEHRAN – The capacity of waste-to-energy plants across Iran has reached 11 megawatts, the country’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization, known as Satba, announced on Sunday.
 A waste-to-energy plant is a waste management facility that combusts wastes to produce electricity. This type of power plant is also called a trash-to-energy, municipal waste incineration, energy recovery, or resource recovery plant. Iran currently has five waste-to–energy plants operating in the cities of Tehran, Shiraz and Mashhad.
