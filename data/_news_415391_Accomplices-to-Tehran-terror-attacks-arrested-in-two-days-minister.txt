TEHRAN – The intelligence minister said on Tuesday that all accomplices to the June 7 twin terrorist attacks in Tehran were identified and arrested only in two days.  “All direct and indirect affiliates (to the terrorist attacks) were arrested in a matter of two days,” said Mahmoud Alavi. Over the past few years, upwards of 120 terrorist plots have been foiled, Alavi added.  At least 17 were killed and 56 injured on June 7 as ISIS-linked assailants attacked Iran’s Parliament building and the tomb of its revolutionary founder.
