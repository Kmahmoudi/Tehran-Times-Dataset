TEHRAN - Forces from the Islamic Revolution Guards and Basij will continue to provide relief aid to victims of the recent floods until the situation goes back to normal, IRGC spokesman Brigadier General Ramazan Sharif said on Sunday.  Sharif said the forces focus on providing the flood-stricken people with basic services such as nutrition, healthcare, housing and transportation, IRNA reported. He said visits by top IRGC commanders to the flood-hit areas played a decisive role in managing the crisis and alleviating the plight of the flood victims. During the last month, forces with the IRGC and Basji as well as jihadi groups came to the people’s help by doing field work, cooperating with provincial crisis management centers, establishing security and assisting people in housing, nutrition and cleaning up homes, the spokesman added. Catastrophic floods hit 1,900 cities and villages in western, southwestern, northern and northeastern Iran last month, leaving 76 dead and hundreds of thousands displaced. Ever since, the IRGC, among other organizations, has been a key part of fighting floods. However, in an ill-advised move U.S. President Donald Trump on April 8 labeled the Guards as a “foreign terrorist organization”. The move unified all Iranian political factions, with many hailing the IRGC as an “anti-terror” organization which has greatly contributed to regional stability.
