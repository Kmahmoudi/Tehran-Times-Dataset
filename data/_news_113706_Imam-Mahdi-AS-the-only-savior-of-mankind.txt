Let's not talk about the present depressed Age and the confused, unhappy, alienated man, but let's talk about the bright future of peace and happiness at the time of the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (AS). The Holy Prophet (S) said: "Glad tidings be to you about Mahdi (AS)." Thereafter he said: "The inhabitants of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth are happy with him. He shall distribute the wealth equally, free Muhammad's (S) ummah from need or want and comfort them with his righteousness." Islamic scholars, based on the infallible sayings, are of the opinion that the sign of Mahdi (AS) is that he shall be harsh with rulers, generous with people in distributing wealth, and gentle with the helpless in easing their pain. Only hope The master of the faithful Imam Ali (AS) says about Imam Mahdi's (AS) characteristics: "At the time when they (people) shall suit the guidance to follow the desires, Mahdi (AS) shall alter the desires to follow the guidance. At the time when they shall interpret the Holy Quran to follow their (own) prudence Mahdi (AS) shall realize (their) prudence to follow the Quran. Mahdi (AS) shall demonstrate to you justice. Mahdi (AS) shall enliven the commandments of the Quran and Sunna which were until then dead and lifeless. Imam Mahdi (AS) shall fill the earth with equity and justice after it has been filled with cruelty end oppression." The Holy Prophet (S) said: "There shall emerge a person from my progeny who will speak only my Sunna. Allah will send rain for him from heavens and the earth shall throw out its bounties for him. He shall fill the earth with equity and justice just as it had been filled with cruelty and oppression." Furthermore, the Holy Prophet (S) while mentioning the injustice and seditiousness of  despotic rulers , said : "If  there  remains not  more than one day for the earth, Allah will prolong the day until a person from my  progeny comes and rules. Then great events shall take place through his hands and Islam shall manifest itself. " Hence, not only Shia people but all people throughout the world expect him day and night. Of all the various ways and methods to prepare for his appearance, the author as a sociologist is of the opinion that "supplication" or "dua" is the most important way. Due to lack of spirituality in today's advanced industrialized society, man has to prepare himself  psychologically and  mentally for that. Islamic supplications (duas) and salutations (ziarat), besides being sacred, holy, and divine blessings, are also great and comprehensive treasures full of humanitarian concepts. Reciting them, like attending a training course, leaves a very deep and good  impression on our personalities, the reason being that their interesting and meaningful texts are narrated directly from our Prophet (S) and his infallible Household (AS) in which they have taught various lessons about the sublime teaching  of monotheism, resusrrection prophethood, and mastership (wilayat), moral sense, laws, and ethics. Indeed the school of supplication is one of the higher schools which has a great effect in the development of human thinking and spiritual and social growth, if it is correctly used. Until the Muslims all graduate from this school, their Islamic personalities will not become perfect. The school is open for everybody, and the repetition of its lessons will always make people ascend from one stage to another. One of these treasures which believers and those anxious for the reappearance of the righteous and universal government of Imam Mahdi (AS) have set their hearts upon is the glorious "Nudba" supplication. They renew their allegiance with their Master during fixed occasions and hold emotional gatherings where it is recited. Lamentation (Nudba) and  waiting for the meeting with His Holiness and the end of his occultation, praying to hasten his reappearance and expressing regret about the turbulent and oppressive conditions of the modern world (the period of the major occultation) are lessons which the Shia have learned from their infallible Imams (AS) and their behavior is a pattern for their partisans . Sadir-e-Seirafi, a distinguished companion of Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS), said that along with three other companions he visited Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS). They saw Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) in a very sad and sorrowful condition, sitting on the ground. Like a mother who had lost her dear son and with a painful heart, Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) was crying, wailing, moaning and saying: "My master, your occultation has snatched away sleep from my eyes, has taken my concentration and has deprived my heart of tranquility. My master, your occultation has surrounded me with a tragic suffering due to which I can never find sympathy and consolation. Due to the loss of friends one after the other, our gathering is breaking . Calamities, hardships, difficulties, and disasters have so much pained my heart that I do not feel the tears of my eyes and the yelling and crying of my heart. Yet, other severe and unbearable sufferings are imagined, that one more difficult and fragile than the previous ones. Sadir said: "Calamity struck us and our hearts became full of sadness and sorrow for Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS). We presumed that an unpleasant event had put Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) -- this mountain of patience and forbearance -- in such a lamenting and mournful condition. "We said: '0, Son of the best of mankind. May Allah not make you cry. For what circumstances are you weeping in such a manner? His holiness heaved a sad sigh from his afflicted heart and said: 'This morning, I was looking at "The Book of Jafr", the book of knowledge of various predictions until the Resurrection (Qiamat), which has been assigned and made exclusive to Hazrat Muhammad (S) and his successors (AS). It contains descriptions of the birth, occultation, delay in the reappearance, and longevity of Hazrat Mahdi (AS), the sufferings of believers during the occultation, and the doubts and uncertainties which arise in their hearts. Due to the prolongation of the occultation and these things, grief and sadness has overpowered me...'" (Kamaluddin, pp. 352-357; Ghaibat-e Tusi, pp. 104-108). Therefore, considering the behavior of Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) regarding the occultation of Hazrat Mahdi (AS), we should also become sad and depressed and express our wish and desire for his reappearance by seeking shelter in Allah and reciting Dua, bearing in mind that if He (Allah) wishes, He can end the occultation of  Imam Mahdi (AS) in one night itself . Dua-ye Nudba is one of the most important and famous authentic duas of the Shia. The strength of the text and vocabulary and its meaningful themes increase the reliability of this document. This dua has been narrated by the great Seyyed, the late Razi ud-Din Ali ibn Taus who was one of the great Shia scholars of the seventh century AH. He recorded this dua in the seventh chapter of his great book "Iqbal" on pages 295 to 299. According to Shia scholars, recitation of this supplication is recommended as mustahab (highly advised) on four Islamic major festivals (ids): Friday, Fitr (holiday marking the end of Ramadan) , Adha, and Ghadir (the day on which Imam Ali {AS} was appointed to be the real successor of the Holy Prophet {S}). Therefore, it is advisable to recite this great dua in congregations on. Friday mornings and on the other mentioned days, concentrating our minds in asking forgiveness and reciting salawat in order to wash away our sins and remove the obstacles which have prevented our duas from being answered. Then with full attention, weeping and moaning, we call on Imam Mahdi (AS) in the same way as, Sadir has narrated from Imam Sadeq (AS). We cry and recite Nudba because of the occultation and being far away from Imam Mahdi (AS). We ask Allah to hasten his reappearance and thus end the corruption, persecution and injustice which are reigning in this world due to the absence of Imam Mahdi (AS). May Almighty Allah have mercy upon our Nudbas and lamentations. He may have mercy upon a weeping one from amongst the weepers and remove the chastisement of the occultation from amongst us. Thus, He may give us the grace and favor of the presence of Imam Mahdi (AS) once more. Following are some quotations from this glorious supplication, which only contains words of love about the holy existence of Imam Mahdi (AS): "Where is the chief of all creatures and the Godfearing? Where is the Accumulator of the words of piety? Where is the' Master of the Day of Victory and' the one who will spread the flag oguidance? Where is the Uniter or the companions of virtue and' divine pleasure? Where is the Avenger of the blood of prophets and children of prophets? Where is the one ready to annihilate the oppressors? Where is the Awaited one for straightening the crookedness and dishonesty? Where is the one who is expected Imam Mahdi (AS) to abolish oppression and transgression? Where is the Enlivener of the tenets of religion and its adherents? Where is the Breaker of the might of the trans- gressors? Where is the Demolisher of the edifices of polytheism and hypocrisy? Where is the Destroyer of the followers of disooedience and rebellion?" The words of love for him continue: "Would that I knew the far-off place where you are settled. Or whether earth or soil has embraced you. It is intolerable for me that I see the people but do not see you, and neither do I hear a sigh o! breath nor (any) whispering from you. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who seems to be concealed (physically), but  not away from us. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who is the goal and aspiration of every faithful man and woman who desires you, remembers you, and laments for you. "How long must I wait for you, O my Master! And how long and with which word should I praise you, and what secret talk should I use with you? Is there any helper with whom I may prolong my lamentation and weeping? Is there a way, O Son of Ahmad (S), through which you may be met? Will you see us gathered around you and you are leading all the people? So, convey to him our greetings and salutations, and increease his honor because of this (greeting), O Lord ." May Allah hasten His reappearance.

His holiness heaved a sad sigh from his afflicted heart and said: 'This morning, I was looking at "The Book of Jafr", the book of knowledge of various predictions until the Resurrection (Qiamat), which has been assigned and made exclusive to Hazrat Muhammad (S) and his successors (AS). It contains descriptions of the birth, occultation, delay in the reappearance, and longevity of Hazrat Mahdi (AS), the sufferings of believers during the occultation, and the doubts and uncertainties which arise in their hearts. Due to the prolongation of the occultation and these things, grief and sadness has overpowered me...'" (Kamaluddin, pp. 352-357; Ghaibat-e Tusi, pp. 104-108). Therefore, considering the behavior of Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) regarding the occultation of Hazrat Mahdi (AS), we should also become sad and depressed and express our wish and desire for his reappearance by seeking shelter in Allah and reciting Dua, bearing in mind that if He (Allah) wishes, He can end the occultation of  Imam Mahdi (AS) in one night itself . Dua-ye Nudba is one of the most important and famous authentic duas of the Shia. The strength of the text and vocabulary and its meaningful themes increase the reliability of this document. This dua has been narrated by the great Seyyed, the late Razi ud-Din Ali ibn Taus who was one of the great Shia scholars of the seventh century AH. He recorded this dua in the seventh chapter of his great book "Iqbal" on pages 295 to 299. According to Shia scholars, recitation of this supplication is recommended as mustahab (highly advised) on four Islamic major festivals (ids): Friday, Fitr (holiday marking the end of Ramadan) , Adha, and Ghadir (the day on which Imam Ali {AS} was appointed to be the real successor of the Holy Prophet {S}). Therefore, it is advisable to recite this great dua in congregations on. Friday mornings and on the other mentioned days, concentrating our minds in asking forgiveness and reciting salawat in order to wash away our sins and remove the obstacles which have prevented our duas from being answered. Then with full attention, weeping and moaning, we call on Imam Mahdi (AS) in the same way as, Sadir has narrated from Imam Sadeq (AS). We cry and recite Nudba because of the occultation and being far away from Imam Mahdi (AS). We ask Allah to hasten his reappearance and thus end the corruption, persecution and injustice which are reigning in this world due to the absence of Imam Mahdi (AS). May Almighty Allah have mercy upon our Nudbas and lamentations. He may have mercy upon a weeping one from amongst the weepers and remove the chastisement of the occultation from amongst us. Thus, He may give us the grace and favor of the presence of Imam Mahdi (AS) once more. Following are some quotations from this glorious supplication, which only contains words of love about the holy existence of Imam Mahdi (AS): "Where is the chief of all creatures and the Godfearing? Where is the Accumulator of the words of piety? Where is the' Master of the Day of Victory and' the one who will spread the flag oguidance? Where is the Uniter or the companions of virtue and' divine pleasure? Where is the Avenger of the blood of prophets and children of prophets? Where is the one ready to annihilate the oppressors? Where is the Awaited one for straightening the crookedness and dishonesty? Where is the one who is expected Imam Mahdi (AS) to abolish oppression and transgression? Where is the Enlivener of the tenets of religion and its adherents? Where is the Breaker of the might of the trans- gressors? Where is the Demolisher of the edifices of polytheism and hypocrisy? Where is the Destroyer of the followers of disooedience and rebellion?" The words of love for him continue: "Would that I knew the far-off place where you are settled. Or whether earth or soil has embraced you. It is intolerable for me that I see the people but do not see you, and neither do I hear a sigh o! breath nor (any) whispering from you. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who seems to be concealed (physically), but  not away from us. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who is the goal and aspiration of every faithful man and woman who desires you, remembers you, and laments for you. "How long must I wait for you, O my Master! And how long and with which word should I praise you, and what secret talk should I use with you? Is there any helper with whom I may prolong my lamentation and weeping? Is there a way, O Son of Ahmad (S), through which you may be met? Will you see us gathered around you and you are leading all the people? So, convey to him our greetings and salutations, and increease his honor because of this (greeting), O Lord ." May Allah hasten His reappearance.

                  Mahdi (AS) shall demonstrate to you justice. Mahdi (AS) shall enliven the commandments of the Quran and Sunna which were until then dead and lifeless. Imam Mahdi (AS) shall fill the earth with equity and justice after it has been filled with cruelty end oppression." The Holy Prophet (S) said: "There shall emerge a person from my progeny who will speak only my Sunna. Allah will send rain for him from heavens and the earth shall throw out its bounties for him. He shall fill the earth with equity and justice just as it had been filled with cruelty and oppression." Furthermore, the Holy Prophet (S) while mentioning the injustice and seditiousness of  despotic rulers , said : "If  there  remains not  more than one day for the earth, Allah will prolong the day until a person from my  progeny comes and rules. Then great events shall take place through his hands and Islam shall manifest itself. " Hence, not only Shia people but all people throughout the world expect him day and night. Of all the various ways and methods to prepare for his appearance, the author as a sociologist is of the opinion that "supplication" or "dua" is the most important way. Due to lack of spirituality in today's advanced industrialized society, man has to prepare himself  psychologically and  mentally for that. Islamic supplications (duas) and salutations (ziarat), besides being sacred, holy, and divine blessings, are also great and comprehensive treasures full of humanitarian concepts. Reciting them, like attending a training course, leaves a very deep and good  impression on our personalities, the reason being that their interesting and meaningful texts are narrated directly from our Prophet (S) and his infallible Household (AS) in which they have taught various lessons about the sublime teaching  of monotheism, resusrrection prophethood, and mastership (wilayat), moral sense, laws, and ethics. Indeed the school of supplication is one of the higher schools which has a great effect in the development of human thinking and spiritual and social growth, if it is correctly used. Until the Muslims all graduate from this school, their Islamic personalities will not become perfect. The school is open for everybody, and the repetition of its lessons will always make people ascend from one stage to another. One of these treasures which believers and those anxious for the reappearance of the righteous and universal government of Imam Mahdi (AS) have set their hearts upon is the glorious "Nudba" supplication. They renew their allegiance with their Master during fixed occasions and hold emotional gatherings where it is recited. Lamentation (Nudba) and  waiting for the meeting with His Holiness and the end of his occultation, praying to hasten his reappearance and expressing regret about the turbulent and oppressive conditions of the modern world (the period of the major occultation) are lessons which the Shia have learned from their infallible Imams (AS) and their behavior is a pattern for their partisans . Sadir-e-Seirafi, a distinguished companion of Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS), said that along with three other companions he visited Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS). They saw Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) in a very sad and sorrowful condition, sitting on the ground. Like a mother who had lost her dear son and with a painful heart, Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) was crying, wailing, moaning and saying: "My master, your occultation has snatched away sleep from my eyes, has taken my concentration and has deprived my heart of tranquility. My master, your occultation has surrounded me with a tragic suffering due to which I can never find sympathy and consolation. Due to the loss of friends one after the other, our gathering is breaking . Calamities, hardships, difficulties, and disasters have so much pained my heart that I do not feel the tears of my eyes and the yelling and crying of my heart. Yet, other severe and unbearable sufferings are imagined, that one more difficult and fragile than the previous ones. Sadir said: "Calamity struck us and our hearts became full of sadness and sorrow for Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS). We presumed that an unpleasant event had put Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) -- this mountain of patience and forbearance -- in such a lamenting and mournful condition. "We said: '0, Son of the best of mankind. May Allah not make you cry. For what circumstances are you weeping in such a manner?

Sadir said: "Calamity struck us and our hearts became full of sadness and sorrow for Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS). We presumed that an unpleasant event had put Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) -- this mountain of patience and forbearance -- in such a lamenting and mournful condition. "We said: '0, Son of the best of mankind. May Allah not make you cry. For what circumstances are you weeping in such a manner? His holiness heaved a sad sigh from his afflicted heart and said: 'This morning, I was looking at "The Book of Jafr", the book of knowledge of various predictions until the Resurrection (Qiamat), which has been assigned and made exclusive to Hazrat Muhammad (S) and his successors (AS). It contains descriptions of the birth, occultation, delay in the reappearance, and longevity of Hazrat Mahdi (AS), the sufferings of believers during the occultation, and the doubts and uncertainties which arise in their hearts. Due to the prolongation of the occultation and these things, grief and sadness has overpowered me...'" (Kamaluddin, pp. 352-357; Ghaibat-e Tusi, pp. 104-108). Therefore, considering the behavior of Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) regarding the occultation of Hazrat Mahdi (AS), we should also become sad and depressed and express our wish and desire for his reappearance by seeking shelter in Allah and reciting Dua, bearing in mind that if He (Allah) wishes, He can end the occultation of  Imam Mahdi (AS) in one night itself . Dua-ye Nudba is one of the most important and famous authentic duas of the Shia. The strength of the text and vocabulary and its meaningful themes increase the reliability of this document. This dua has been narrated by the great Seyyed, the late Razi ud-Din Ali ibn Taus who was one of the great Shia scholars of the seventh century AH. He recorded this dua in the seventh chapter of his great book "Iqbal" on pages 295 to 299. According to Shia scholars, recitation of this supplication is recommended as mustahab (highly advised) on four Islamic major festivals (ids): Friday, Fitr (holiday marking the end of Ramadan) , Adha, and Ghadir (the day on which Imam Ali {AS} was appointed to be the real successor of the Holy Prophet {S}). Therefore, it is advisable to recite this great dua in congregations on. Friday mornings and on the other mentioned days, concentrating our minds in asking forgiveness and reciting salawat in order to wash away our sins and remove the obstacles which have prevented our duas from being answered. Then with full attention, weeping and moaning, we call on Imam Mahdi (AS) in the same way as, Sadir has narrated from Imam Sadeq (AS). We cry and recite Nudba because of the occultation and being far away from Imam Mahdi (AS). We ask Allah to hasten his reappearance and thus end the corruption, persecution and injustice which are reigning in this world due to the absence of Imam Mahdi (AS). May Almighty Allah have mercy upon our Nudbas and lamentations. He may have mercy upon a weeping one from amongst the weepers and remove the chastisement of the occultation from amongst us. Thus, He may give us the grace and favor of the presence of Imam Mahdi (AS) once more. Following are some quotations from this glorious supplication, which only contains words of love about the holy existence of Imam Mahdi (AS): "Where is the chief of all creatures and the Godfearing? Where is the Accumulator of the words of piety? Where is the' Master of the Day of Victory and' the one who will spread the flag oguidance? Where is the Uniter or the companions of virtue and' divine pleasure? Where is the Avenger of the blood of prophets and children of prophets? Where is the one ready to annihilate the oppressors? Where is the Awaited one for straightening the crookedness and dishonesty? Where is the one who is expected Imam Mahdi (AS) to abolish oppression and transgression? Where is the Enlivener of the tenets of religion and its adherents? Where is the Breaker of the might of the trans- gressors? Where is the Demolisher of the edifices of polytheism and hypocrisy? Where is the Destroyer of the followers of disooedience and rebellion?" The words of love for him continue: "Would that I knew the far-off place where you are settled. Or whether earth or soil has embraced you. It is intolerable for me that I see the people but do not see you, and neither do I hear a sigh o! breath nor (any) whispering from you. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who seems to be concealed (physically), but  not away from us. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who is the goal and aspiration of every faithful man and woman who desires you, remembers you, and laments for you. "How long must I wait for you, O my Master! And how long and with which word should I praise you, and what secret talk should I use with you? Is there any helper with whom I may prolong my lamentation and weeping? Is there a way, O Son of Ahmad (S), through which you may be met? Will you see us gathered around you and you are leading all the people? So, convey to him our greetings and salutations, and increease his honor because of this (greeting), O Lord ." May Allah hasten His reappearance.

                  Islamic supplications (duas) and salutations (ziarat), besides being sacred, holy, and divine blessings, are also great and comprehensive treasures full of humanitarian concepts. Reciting them, like attending a training course, leaves a very deep and good  impression on our personalities, the reason being that their interesting and meaningful texts are narrated directly from our Prophet (S) and his infallible Household (AS) in which they have taught various lessons about the sublime teaching  of monotheism, resusrrection prophethood, and mastership (wilayat), moral sense, laws, and ethics. Indeed the school of supplication is one of the higher schools which has a great effect in the development of human thinking and spiritual and social growth, if it is correctly used. Until the Muslims all graduate from this school, their Islamic personalities will not become perfect. The school is open for everybody, and the repetition of its lessons will always make people ascend from one stage to another. One of these treasures which believers and those anxious for the reappearance of the righteous and universal government of Imam Mahdi (AS) have set their hearts upon is the glorious "Nudba" supplication. They renew their allegiance with their Master during fixed occasions and hold emotional gatherings where it is recited. Lamentation (Nudba) and  waiting for the meeting with His Holiness and the end of his occultation, praying to hasten his reappearance and expressing regret about the turbulent and oppressive conditions of the modern world (the period of the major occultation) are lessons which the Shia have learned from their infallible Imams (AS) and their behavior is a pattern for their partisans . Sadir-e-Seirafi, a distinguished companion of Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS), said that along with three other companions he visited Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS). They saw Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) in a very sad and sorrowful condition, sitting on the ground. Like a mother who had lost her dear son and with a painful heart, Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) was crying, wailing, moaning and saying: "My master, your occultation has snatched away sleep from my eyes, has taken my concentration and has deprived my heart of tranquility. My master, your occultation has surrounded me with a tragic suffering due to which I can never find sympathy and consolation. Due to the loss of friends one after the other, our gathering is breaking . Calamities, hardships, difficulties, and disasters have so much pained my heart that I do not feel the tears of my eyes and the yelling and crying of my heart. Yet, other severe and unbearable sufferings are imagined, that one more difficult and fragile than the previous ones.

                  Sadir-e-Seirafi, a distinguished companion of Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS), said that along with three other companions he visited Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS). They saw Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) in a very sad and sorrowful condition, sitting on the ground. Like a mother who had lost her dear son and with a painful heart, Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) was crying, wailing, moaning and saying: "My master, your occultation has snatched away sleep from my eyes, has taken my concentration and has deprived my heart of tranquility. My master, your occultation has surrounded me with a tragic suffering due to which I can never find sympathy and consolation. Due to the loss of friends one after the other, our gathering is breaking . Calamities, hardships, difficulties, and disasters have so much pained my heart that I do not feel the tears of my eyes and the yelling and crying of my heart. Yet, other severe and unbearable sufferings are imagined, that one more difficult and fragile than the previous ones. Sadir said: "Calamity struck us and our hearts became full of sadness and sorrow for Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS). We presumed that an unpleasant event had put Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) -- this mountain of patience and forbearance -- in such a lamenting and mournful condition. "We said: '0, Son of the best of mankind. May Allah not make you cry. For what circumstances are you weeping in such a manner? His holiness heaved a sad sigh from his afflicted heart and said: 'This morning, I was looking at "The Book of Jafr", the book of knowledge of various predictions until the Resurrection (Qiamat), which has been assigned and made exclusive to Hazrat Muhammad (S) and his successors (AS). It contains descriptions of the birth, occultation, delay in the reappearance, and longevity of Hazrat Mahdi (AS), the sufferings of believers during the occultation, and the doubts and uncertainties which arise in their hearts. Due to the prolongation of the occultation and these things, grief and sadness has overpowered me...'" (Kamaluddin, pp. 352-357; Ghaibat-e Tusi, pp. 104-108). Therefore, considering the behavior of Imam Jafar Sadeq (AS) regarding the occultation of Hazrat Mahdi (AS), we should also become sad and depressed and express our wish and desire for his reappearance by seeking shelter in Allah and reciting Dua, bearing in mind that if He (Allah) wishes, He can end the occultation of  Imam Mahdi (AS) in one night itself . Dua-ye Nudba is one of the most important and famous authentic duas of the Shia. The strength of the text and vocabulary and its meaningful themes increase the reliability of this document. This dua has been narrated by the great Seyyed, the late Razi ud-Din Ali ibn Taus who was one of the great Shia scholars of the seventh century AH. He recorded this dua in the seventh chapter of his great book "Iqbal" on pages 295 to 299. According to Shia scholars, recitation of this supplication is recommended as mustahab (highly advised) on four Islamic major festivals (ids): Friday, Fitr (holiday marking the end of Ramadan) , Adha, and Ghadir (the day on which Imam Ali {AS} was appointed to be the real successor of the Holy Prophet {S}). Therefore, it is advisable to recite this great dua in congregations on. Friday mornings and on the other mentioned days, concentrating our minds in asking forgiveness and reciting salawat in order to wash away our sins and remove the obstacles which have prevented our duas from being answered. Then with full attention, weeping and moaning, we call on Imam Mahdi (AS) in the same way as, Sadir has narrated from Imam Sadeq (AS). We cry and recite Nudba because of the occultation and being far away from Imam Mahdi (AS). We ask Allah to hasten his reappearance and thus end the corruption, persecution and injustice which are reigning in this world due to the absence of Imam Mahdi (AS). May Almighty Allah have mercy upon our Nudbas and lamentations. He may have mercy upon a weeping one from amongst the weepers and remove the chastisement of the occultation from amongst us. Thus, He may give us the grace and favor of the presence of Imam Mahdi (AS) once more. Following are some quotations from this glorious supplication, which only contains words of love about the holy existence of Imam Mahdi (AS): "Where is the chief of all creatures and the Godfearing? Where is the Accumulator of the words of piety? Where is the' Master of the Day of Victory and' the one who will spread the flag oguidance? Where is the Uniter or the companions of virtue and' divine pleasure? Where is the Avenger of the blood of prophets and children of prophets? Where is the one ready to annihilate the oppressors? Where is the Awaited one for straightening the crookedness and dishonesty? Where is the one who is expected Imam Mahdi (AS) to abolish oppression and transgression? Where is the Enlivener of the tenets of religion and its adherents? Where is the Breaker of the might of the trans- gressors? Where is the Demolisher of the edifices of polytheism and hypocrisy? Where is the Destroyer of the followers of disooedience and rebellion?" The words of love for him continue: "Would that I knew the far-off place where you are settled. Or whether earth or soil has embraced you. It is intolerable for me that I see the people but do not see you, and neither do I hear a sigh o! breath nor (any) whispering from you. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who seems to be concealed (physically), but  not away from us. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who is the goal and aspiration of every faithful man and woman who desires you, remembers you, and laments for you. "How long must I wait for you, O my Master! And how long and with which word should I praise you, and what secret talk should I use with you? Is there any helper with whom I may prolong my lamentation and weeping? Is there a way, O Son of Ahmad (S), through which you may be met? Will you see us gathered around you and you are leading all the people? So, convey to him our greetings and salutations, and increease his honor because of this (greeting), O Lord ." May Allah hasten His reappearance.

Where is the Uniter or the companions of virtue and' divine pleasure? Where is the Avenger of the blood of prophets and children of prophets? Where is the one ready to annihilate the oppressors? Where is the Awaited one for straightening the crookedness and dishonesty? Where is the one who is expected Imam Mahdi (AS) to abolish oppression and transgression? Where is the Enlivener of the tenets of religion and its adherents? Where is the Breaker of the might of the trans- gressors? Where is the Demolisher of the edifices of polytheism and hypocrisy? Where is the Destroyer of the followers of disooedience and rebellion?" The words of love for him continue: "Would that I knew the far-off place where you are settled. Or whether earth or soil has embraced you. It is intolerable for me that I see the people but do not see you, and neither do I hear a sigh o! breath nor (any) whispering from you. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who seems to be concealed (physically), but  not away from us. "May I myself be sacrificed for you who is the goal and aspiration of every faithful man and woman who desires you, remembers you, and laments for you. "How long must I wait for you, O my Master! And how long and with which word should I praise you, and what secret talk should I use with you? Is there any helper with whom I may prolong my lamentation and weeping? Is there a way, O Son of Ahmad (S), through which you may be met? Will you see us gathered around you and you are leading all the people? So, convey to him our greetings and salutations, and increease his honor because of this (greeting), O Lord ." May Allah hasten His reappearance.

                  Therefore, it is advisable to recite this great dua in congregations on. Friday mornings and on the other mentioned days, concentrating our minds in asking forgiveness and reciting salawat in order to wash away our sins and remove the obstacles which have prevented our duas from being answered. Then with full attention, weeping and moaning, we call on Imam Mahdi (AS) in the same way as, Sadir has narrated from Imam Sadeq (AS). We cry and recite Nudba because of the occultation and being far away from Imam Mahdi (AS). We ask Allah to hasten his reappearance and thus end the corruption, persecution and injustice which are reigning in this world due to the absence of Imam Mahdi (AS). May Almighty Allah have mercy upon our Nudbas and lamentations. He may have mercy upon a weeping one from amongst the weepers and remove the chastisement of the occultation from amongst us. Thus, He may give us the grace and favor of the presence of Imam Mahdi (AS) once more.
