TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani asserted on Wednesday that the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president will have no effect on Iran’s behavior. “The outcome of the U.S. elections has no impact on the Islamic Republic of Iran’s policies,” Rouhani told a cabinet session on Wednesday. At risk may be the nuclear deal, formally known as the JCPOA, in effect since January 16. Outgoing President Barack Obama championed the historic deal with Iran. However, in his campaign speeches now president-elect Trump had raised the prospect the U.S. would pull out of the pact. However, later he toned down his rhetoric by saying he had never said he would “rip up” the deal but “police that contract so tough they don’t have a chance…” But, President Rouhani believes Washington is no longer capable of leading the world and forming a coalition against Tehran. “The U.S. situation in the international community and the public opinion of the world has weakened due to wrong policies, and yawning gap with the international community and Europe will worsen the current situation further,” Rouhani noted. President Rouhani believes Washington is no longer capable of leading the world and forming a coalition against Tehran Zarif urges Trump to stick to nuclear agreement  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also reacted to Trump’s election as the 45th U.S. president, noting Trump has to remain committed to the nuclear deal. The U.S. should “fulfil its commitments in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as a multilateral international agreement,” Zarif told reporters in Romania. “Every U.S. president has to understand the realities of today's world. The most important thing is that the future U.S. president sticks to agreements, to engagements undertaken,” Zarif said in Romania. Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani said the result of the U.S. election shows that the majority of the American people are “frustrated” and “distrustful” of the system. Shamkhani also said the U.S. election will not influence Iran’s policies. Iran’s policies, contrary to some other regional countries, have never been influenced by change of governments in the other countries, the top security official noted. Shamkhani said Iran’s policies are reliant on public support and capacities. ‘New U.S. government’s performance matters to Iran’ Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram said on Tuesday that the “performance” and “executive policies” of the new U.S. government matters to Iran. Qassemi said “serious review” is required in the U.S. policies in the Middle East. The policies adopted by the former U.S. governments and their interferences in the regional countries’ affairs are the main reasons behind the spread of violence and extremism in the Islamic countries, the ministry spokesman pointed out.
