Violent crackdown continues in the occupied Palestinian territories. In their latest aggression, Israeli military forces have fatally shot a Palestinian man at the main checkpoint between the northern part of the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem al-Quds over allegations he attempted to carry out a stabbing attack. Israeli media outlets have not identified the victim, but have reported that he made an attempt to stab the soldiers manning the Qalandiya checkpoint on Tuesday morning, prompting them to open fire. According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli forces prevented the arrival of ambulances and medical staff at the site until the man was pronounced dead. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said that no soldier had been injured in the purported assault, and that the checkpoint had been closed off. Also on Monday, the Jerusalem al-Quds District Court sentenced 19-year-old Subhi Abu Khalifa, a resident of the Palestinian neighborhood of Shuafat in East Jerusalem al-Quds, to 18 years in jail on charges of injuring two Israeli men in the French Hill neighborhood in October 2015. In addition to the jail term, Abu Khalifa was ordered to pay 180,000 Israeli shekels (over $46,500) in compensation to the pair. On November 7, the same court sentenced 14-year-old Ahmad Saleh Manasra to 12 years in prison on charges of attempting to murder a 20-year-old man and a 12-year-old boy in Pisgat Ze’ev settlement in East Jerusalem al-Quds in October 2015. The Palestinian teenage boy was also ordered to pay 80,000 shekels ($21,000) in compensation to the Israeli man and 100,000 shekels ($26,260) to the youngster. The occupied territories have been the scene of increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015. More than 260 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since October 2015.
