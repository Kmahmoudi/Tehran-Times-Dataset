As a newspaper that is classified as conservative, Farhikhtegan has welcomed remarks by President Ebrahim Raisi who told a cabinet session on Wednesday that the government is open to hear the “voice of protestors”.  The newspaper, run by the Islamic Azad University, has asked the government to decide about “peaceful protests”. However, it names three groups that should not be included in dialogue: those who seek to overthrow the political system; those wanting to break up the country; and those intending to undermine the basic cultural principles. The newspaper said such groups don’t deserve dialogue and instead should be dealt with decisively. Kayhan: Celebrities’ role in chaos In its editorial, the conservative newspaper of Kayhan discussed the destructive role of some celebrities in the country’s recent riots, citing global examples, criticizing Iranian celebrities who consider themselves above the law and fueling fake news. “One of the main demands of people with different political persuasions and different lifestyles, both in the funerals of security martyrs and in the virtual space, was taking a firm, uncompromising and deterrent approach against offending celebrities. The author called these celebrities as traitors and wrote that counting on them is a miscalculation of Iran’s enemies. Sharq: Reformists must pay the price The reformist Sharq newspaper has discussed the recent meeting of some reformist figures with senior officials in a report entitled “Time for Reconciliation?” According to the newspaper, in recent days a group of reformists met with Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, and Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, the head of the judiciary.  In its report, the newspaper asked the reformists not to consider these meetings as an opportunity to reach management tables and return to power, but to establish a communication bridge between the protesters and the government. “If the reformists are really looking for the country's way out of this crisis and seek a future under national interests and security, they must pay the political cost of creating a proper communication bridge in the direction of dialogue.” Iran: U.S. frustrated with unrest The state-run Iran newspaper ran a headline in which Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian says “The Americans are disappointed with the unrest in Iran and are seeking to return to the negotiating table.”  Quoting the foreign minister, it said the Americans act in a contradictory manner in a way that on one hand they seek diplomacy with Iran (with regard to the efforts to revive the JCPOA) and on the other say something different in media. “When we send them a message to know the reason behind their contradictory behavior, they answer that they look at public opinion in the media.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
