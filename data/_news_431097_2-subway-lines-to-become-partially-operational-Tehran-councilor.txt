TEHRAN — Subway lines 6 and 7 of Tehran will become partially operational by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019), councilor Ali Krooni has said.
 Both lines are currently under construction. Line 6 is almost 32 kilometers long with 27 stations connecting southeast Tehran to northwest.  Subway line 7 is 22 kilometers long. With 23 stations the line also connects southeastern Tehran to northwestern parts of the city. The subway line was first partially opened in June 2017 but was closed due to safety issues in November 2017. Tehran subway line 7 was partially reopened in mid-July with 5 stations stretching over 6 kilometers.  Krooni went on to explain that the two more stations for line 7 will be operational and 4 station of line 6 stretching over 10 kilometers will be also up and running by the end of the year.  Some 9 trillion rials (nearly $2 million) has been allocated to the completion of the two aforementioned lines, Mehr news agency quoted Krooni as saying on Monday.  Meanwhile, CEO of Tehran Metro, Ali Emam, said on Tuesday that once line 6 is fully operational some 6 trillion rials (nearly $1.4 million) will be saved annually, Tasnim news agency reported.  Except for line 7, currently there are five fully operational subway lines in the city of Tehran which deliver some 2.2 million rides on a daily basis, and line 6 is still under construction.  Once lines 6 and 7 are completed they can increase the metro ridership to some five million a day.
