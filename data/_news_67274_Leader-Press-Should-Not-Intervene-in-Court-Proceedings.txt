"The press should not intervene in the court proceedings," the Leader stressed. Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with the Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi and other judicial officials on the occasion of the martyrdom anniversary of former chief justice late Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti. The terrorist Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) carried out bombing of the Islamic Republic Party in 1981 which led to martyrdom of the late Ayatollah Beheshti and 72 other cabinet ministers and ranking officials. "Protest against legal rulings has its own course and is being brought up to the Higher Court. Defending convicted people is the business of defense lawyers and therefore the press have no right to involve in defending those under legal proceeding by the Judiciary," the Leader said. The Leader cautioned that undermining the Judiciary would be detrimental to security in the everyday life of people adding that any action aimed at promoting the Judiciary is a step forward to promote Islam. The Leader also said that the Judiciary is expected to strongly defend justice. He paid glowing tribute to the late Ayatollah Beheshti and other statesmen who lost their lives in the bomb blast. The Leader said the opponents of the late Ayatollah Beheshti were opponents of the Islamic Republic who made conspiracy to assassinate the architect of the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khamenei said that the Judiciary is one pillar of the Islamic Republic in charge of campaign against financial corruption and the lackeys of the global arrogance who take action against the Islamic Republic. "If the global arrogance enjoying financial strength and media networks manages to set up a base inside the country by hiring some foolish people, the Judiciary is responsible to strongly deal with those standing against the Iranian nation," the Leader said. The Leader praised administration of the Judiciary by Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi and recommended the staff of the Judiciary to take into account Ayatollah Shahroudi's guidelines to improve state of affairs in the Judiciary. The Leader said that the Judiciary is making progress and hoped the body would work to the extent that people can pin hopes on it as a strong body helping them retake their rights. Prior to the Leader's remarks, the head of the Judiciary honored the memory of late Ayatollah Beheshti and 72 cabinet ministers and top officials who lost their lives in the terrorist act and said that the staff of the Judiciary are working hard to fulfill their responsibilities.
