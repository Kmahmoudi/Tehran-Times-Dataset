TEHRAN – Iran will host the 7th edition of Asia Pacific Geoparks Network (APGN) Symposium in 2021. The 5th edition of the event was wrapped up on Friday in the Zhijindong Cave UNESCO Global Geopark, China, and the next edition will be held in Indonesia in 2019. The venue of the symposium will be either Qeshm Island – which has been registered by UNESCO - or other geoparks, which may be registered by 2020, Iran representative to APGN Advisory Committee Alireza Amrikazemi told Mehr on Saturday. “In this way, the role of Iran in the geoparks network will be more highlighted,” he explained. The Qeshm Island has been granted the designation of UNESCO Global Geopark for a four-year period from May 5, 2017 to May 4, 2021.  Qeshm embraces wide range of ecotourism attractions such as the Hara marine forests and about 60 villages dotted mostly across its rocky coastlines. The island has an abundance of wildlife, including birds, reptiles, dolphins and turtles as well. Regional Geopark Networks serve for the coordination of Global Geoparks Network activities at a regional or continental level and as fora for the exchange of information and co-operation between Global Geoparks and Global Geopark professionals in the region.  SB/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
