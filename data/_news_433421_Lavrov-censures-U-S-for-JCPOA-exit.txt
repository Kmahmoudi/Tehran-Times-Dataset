TEHRAN – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has pointed to continuation of U.S. unilateralism and American officials’ disregard for UN Security Council decisions, criticizing the U.S. for walking away from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Lavrov, who has visited Vietnam to attend the International Cooperation in a Troubled World, said the U.S. wants to solve some problems in its own fashion instead of following international standards, IRNA reported. He added that rarely one can hear any statements in support of international norms by the U.S. government nowadays and instead Americans defend the order which is based on their own principles.
