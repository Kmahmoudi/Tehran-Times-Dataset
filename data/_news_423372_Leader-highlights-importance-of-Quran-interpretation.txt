TEHRAN – Addressing his theology students on April 17, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lauded the efforts of cleric Mohsen Qara’ati in teaching lessons from the Quran. Before the Leader started his remarks, Qara’ati commented on the Quran and the lessons that can be derived from it. “What he (Qara’ati) stated about the importance of Quran lessons and contemplation on the Quran is among today’s necessary and needed discussions in our society,” the Leader said, khamenei.ir reported on Tuesday. Pointing to the lack of Quran lessons when he was young, the Leader said such a shortcoming has been resolved due to endeavors by Qara’ati.
