TEHRAN â€“ A former Iranian diplomat believes that in the aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear accord, Iran should take the initiative to help resolve regional crises. In an interview with the Iran newspaper published on Sunday, Seyed Hossein Mousavian, who is currently a researcher at Princeton University, said Iran is an influential actor in the region and can negotiate with regional powers. He further said except for Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Iran has good relations with regional countries and can cooperate with Russia, China and other world powers to take the initiative in resolving regional issues.
