TEHRAN – An official with the Guardian Council said on Wednesday members of a central committee to supervise the integrity of the next year’s presidential election have been named. “Members of the central supervisory committee for the 12th presidential election and midterm parliamentary elections were named in the Guardian Council’s today session,” said Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee, the body’s spokesman. The supervisory board includes Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, Ebrahim Raeesi, Mohammad Reza Alizadeh, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee, Mohsen Esmaeeli, and Siamak Rahpeyk, the official said. Except Raeesi, the other six are currently member of the Guardian Council. Iran will hold the next year’s presidential election on May 19, 2017, one month earlier than usual so as not to coincide with the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan which starts in late May. Under Article 99 of Iran’s Constitution, the responsibility to supervise elections lays with the Guardian Council.
 
The body consists of six theologians appointed by the Supreme Leader and six jurists nominated by the Judiciary and approved by parliament. All bills passed by parliament have to be approved by the council which has the power to veto them if it considers them inconsistent with the constitution and Islamic law. It can also bar candidates from standing in elections to parliament, the presidency and the Assembly of Experts.
