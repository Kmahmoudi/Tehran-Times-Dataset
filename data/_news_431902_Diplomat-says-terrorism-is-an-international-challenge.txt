TEHRAN - Kazem Gharib Abadi, Iran’s representative to the Vienna-based international organizations, has said that terrorism is a serious challenge to the international community.
 “Terrorism is a serious challenge to the whole international community whose consequences and dangers are extra-regional,” he tweeted on Tuesday. He described terrorism as “one of the most fundamental problems of the international community and the most dangerous threat against the nations’ rights and international stability”. He noted that Iran supports any action in line with fighting terrorism. Pointing to Mujahedin Khalq Organization’s activities in certain Western countries, he said that the MKO terrorists’ presence in Western countries show double standards in countering terrorism. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on January 10, “Europeans, incl Denmark, Holland & France, harbor MEK—who killed 12000 Iranians & abetted Saddam’s crimes against Iraqi Kurds—as well as other terrorists staging murder of innocent Iranians from Europe. Accusing Iran won’t absolve Europe of responsibility for harboring terrorists.” The MKO did numerous terrorist acts in Iran, especially in the early years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It also sided with Saddam Hussein’s army in the war against Iran in the 1980s. Saddam also used the extremist group in violent crackdown on the Iraqi Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south.
