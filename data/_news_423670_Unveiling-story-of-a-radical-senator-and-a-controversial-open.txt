TEHRAN - Some 47 Republican U.S. senators wrote a controversial letter to Iranian leaders on March 9, 2015 to halt the Iran nuclear agreement. The letter specifically reads that after Barak Obama’s presidential term, the deal will no longer be valid. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas played a major role in drafting the letter which was signed by the Republican leader senator and Marco Rubio, a frontrunner candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. Part if the letter states: Observing the nuclear negotiation, we feel that you haven’t understood the legal structure of government. Any agreement without legislative approval could be reversed by the next president “with the stroke of a pen”, and the next U.S. legislative body can change the provision of the agreement at any given time. Even though three years have passed since the open letter was sent, the essence of the changes is still kept as a mystery by Republicans and senators involved. Although it has been claimed that Cotton was the mastermind behind the letter, few have talked about behind the scenes.  But really, what is the story behind the letter, and what was Cotton’s motivation to write such a letter.   The truth is we must search the answers among names like Robert O'Donnell, one of Tom Cotton's special advisers, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) lobbyist Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and Donald Trump himself. O’Donnell, a powerful media adviser in the Republican Party, played an important role in Cotton’s victory in Arkansas and his seat in the Senate. O’Donnell’s advice to Cotton comes directly from AIPAC, not to mention that Cotton’s wife Anna Peckham who is in indirect communication with the Israeli Intelligence Service Mossad and AIPAC. In January 2015, when the Iran nuclear showed a possibility to go through, AIPAC decided to use the Republican senators as a tool to threaten Iran's foreign ministry officials. The threat acted the same as the letter sent by the AIPAC lobby group by Cotton. O’Donnell was essential responsible for providing and regulating this letter (with influential literature) behind the scenes. Shortly after the release of the letter, Cotton entered into negotiations with two Republican nominees for the 2016 presidential election, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, and their campaign team, for propaganda and their legal rights. The negotiation was also led by O'Donnell, and above that, by the AIPAC lobby management. Cotton, in a meeting with Kushner and a good number of Trump’s campaign team, instructed the AIPAC lobby’s direct order about the need for the cancellation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, by Trump. Finally, in the same presidential campaign, influenced by Kushner and the young senator of the state of Arkansas, Trump decided to talk about the abolition of the nuclear deal on the first day of taking office at the White House in order to gain full support from the AIPAC lobby.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
