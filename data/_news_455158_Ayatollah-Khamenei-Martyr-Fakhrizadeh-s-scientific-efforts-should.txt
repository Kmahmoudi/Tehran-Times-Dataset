TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei issued a statement on Saturday on the assassination of prominent scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, saying the “scientific and technical efforts of this martyr” should be seriously put on the agenda. Fakhrizadeh, a physics professor, was assassinated in a terrorist attack on Friday afternoon in Absard town in Tehran province. Israel is the prime suspect for the assassination. “This leading and prominent nuclear and defense scientist of the country, Mr. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated by the criminal and brutal mercenaries. This unique scientific personality lost his dear and precious life for his great and enduring scientific efforts in way of God and lofty position of martyrdom was his divine reward,” the Leader said in part of his statement.  “All authorities should put two things seriously on agenda, first investigate the crime and decisively punish the perpetrators and those who ordered it, and then continue scientific and technical efforts of the martyr in all sectors in which he was involved,” Ayatollah Khamenei asserted.
