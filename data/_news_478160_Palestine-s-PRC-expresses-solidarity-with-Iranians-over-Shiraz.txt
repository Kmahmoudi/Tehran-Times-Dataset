TEHRAN- A spokesman for the Palestine Resistance Committees (PRC) has extended condolences to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei and the Iranian people over the recent terrorist attack in the city of Shiraz, which claimed lives of 15 people. Speaking with the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV on Saturday, Abu Mojahid stressed that “this terror act will not defeat Iran, which supports the resistance with all its power.”  Mojahid added, “We continue to be on Iran's side.” The comments came after a lone Daesh-affiliated terrorist killed 15 pilgrims, including a woman and three children, and injured 40 others on Wednesday at a sacred shrine in the southcentral city of Shiraz with a machine gun. "The enemy is seeking to destabilize the entire region by the indiscriminate slaughter of children and innocent people," he stated, adding, "What happened in recent days reflects the swelling force of the opposition axis across the board." "Iran is the older brother of the resistance axis," Mojahid added, emphasizing that "such hostile attempts would never weaken the determination of Iran and the axis of resistance." According to Fars province’s police chief, the shooter opened fire on pilgrims inside the Shah-e Cheragh shrine before being injured and apprehended by security forces. The terrorist was characterized as a foreign national by authorities. The Daesh terror group claimed responsibility for the massacre shortly after the operation. CCTV footage shows the terrorist entering the shrine after concealing an assault weapon in a backpack and opened fire on worshipers who sought to run and shelter in hallways. Following the incident, condemnations poured from both inside and outside of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Shortly after the terrorist attack, Ayatollah Khamenei expressed his condolences to the Iranian people and promised that those responsible for the "outrageous" crime will undoubtedly be brought to justice. The Leader also urged law enforcement forces, the judiciary, intellectuals, activists, and the entire country to unite in combat to "the current" that disrespects and disregards people's lives, security, and sanctity. President Ebrahim Raisi also vowed that the Islamic Republic would deal a crushing blow to those responsible for the bloodshed, highlighting the fact that the nation's security and law enforcement organizations "will deliver a decisive response to its architects and operatives, which will make them regret their act" after identifying the causes of this heinous crime.
