TEHRAN – A group of Iranian MPs issued a statement on Tuesday congratulating the Iraqi people and government on the liberation of Fallujah. The statement was read at the end of the open session of parliament. The statement said that “victory” in liberating Fallujah opens new prospect for defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in other Iraqi cities such as Mosul, Al-Raqqah and Aleppo. The Iraqi people stood against the Wahhabis who were supported by the U.S. and Saudis, the statement said. The MPs added the U.S., Israel and some Arab governments spared no efforts in providing the Takfiri terrorists with financial and arms supports, however their plots were foiled thanks to the advisory role given by IRGC Quds Force Commander Major General Qassem Soleimani. The Iraqi forces recaptured Fallujah from ISIL on Friday. The city was occupied by the terrorists in January 2014. “There is no place in Iraq for you [terrorists] and you will be punished for all the crimes you have committed. The Iraqi people are all united against you. Get out of our country, for Iraq is for Iraqis,” the Press TV quoted Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi as saying on Friday.
