TEHRAN – The project for building the first floating solar farm of Iran was launched in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan on Monday, IRIB reported.
 The groundbreaking ceremony of the project in Zahak City was attended by Sorena Sattari, the vice president for science and technology. Speaking in the ceremony, Sattari noted that the 7-megawatt solar farm is going to be constructed on an area of 14 hectares and €8.5 million has been allocated for completing the project. According to Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Homayoon Haeri, Iran’s current solar and wind farms capacity stands at 400 megawatts (MW) and the figure will increase to 1.4 gigawatts (GW) in the next Iranian calendar year (March 2018-March 2019). Renewables, including hydropower, account for just six percent of energy generation, versus natural gas’ 90 percent share. Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence on the regional electricity market.
