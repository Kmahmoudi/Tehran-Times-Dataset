TEHRAN – The United States will regret it if it exits the Iran nuclear agreement, former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said, highlighting the importance of the deal in reducing Western countries’ concerns over Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. president says he wants to be reassured about Iran’s nuclear motives and the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, precisely does that, Straw told IRNA in an interview published on Saturday.  He also voiced concerns over new U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s anti-Iran stances, saying European countries should persuade Washington that withdrawing from the JCPOA is not wise.
