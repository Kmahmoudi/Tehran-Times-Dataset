TEHRAN – The legal team of the Islamic Republic of Iran moved to reject U.S. objections in its preliminary statements at a hearing regarding Iran’s frozen assets, which was held at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague on Wednesday, Al Masdar news reported. Speaking of provisional measures imposed by the U.S. on Iranian entities and companies, specifically its Central Bank [Bank Markazi], Iran’s lawyer Mohsen Mohebbi said “the case we discussed this week does not concern the so-called nuclear-related sanctions.” “It is related to the treatment by different branches of the United States government through a range of legislative, executive, and in particular judicial measures,” he explained.
