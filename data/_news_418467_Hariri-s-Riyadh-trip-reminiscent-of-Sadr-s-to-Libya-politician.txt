TEHRAN – Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, said on Monday that the way Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri was invited to Riyadh was reminiscent of Imam Musa al-Sadr’s invitation to Libya and his subsequent abduction. In a tweet on Monday, Abdollahian suggested that Saudi Arabia had forced Hariri to resign as prime minister of Lebanon, saying the kingdom “does not have mercy, even on its friends,” ISNA reported. On November 4, Hariri announced his resignation in a televised program broadcast from Saudi Arabia.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
