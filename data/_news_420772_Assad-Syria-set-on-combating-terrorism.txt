Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has reiterated that Syria is bent on pushing ahead with counter-terrorism aided by friendly countries, namely Iran and Russia.

 The president’s remarks came as he received on Saturday the Iranian foreign minister’s Special Assistant in Political Affairs Hossein Jaberi Ansari. Strategic Syrian-Iranian ties and the mutual desire to boost them were high on agenda during the meeting, as well as common counter-terrorism efforts and endeavors for the forthcoming Syrian national dialogue congress in Sochi, Russia. President also discussed the Turkish incessant aggression against Syrian territories and crimes against Syrian citizens. The two sides agreed that the aggression is aimed at grabbing Syrian territories, backing terrorist organizations, and torpedoing peace efforts in Syria. Ansari, for his part, reiterated Iran’s steady support for Syria in the fight against terrorism and in the reconstruction process. (Source: Almanar)
