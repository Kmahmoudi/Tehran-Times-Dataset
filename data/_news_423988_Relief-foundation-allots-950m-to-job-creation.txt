TEHRAN — Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation has allocated some 40 trillion rials (nearly $950 million) to job creation for 200,000 individuals in the current Iranian calendar year (March 2018-March 2019), the foundation’s head has said.
 Last year, the foundation allocated some 24 trillion rials (nearly $570 million) for job creation for 135,000 people, IRIB quoted Parviz Fattah as saying on Sunday.  Boosting job creation is one of the primary objectives of the foundation which will be accomplished by soliciting support from parliament and the banks, Fattah highlighted.  The Tehran province’s office of the foundation has created some 6,000 jobs and granted loans amounting to 700 billion rials (nearly $16.5 million) to the families who are in financial distress in the province over the past Iranian calendar year. The director general of Tehran province’s office of the foundation, Mohsen Valiee, has explained that the money was granted to the families to help them create jobs. “The sum is not very considerable but it has enabled some families to start small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).” Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation is a charitable organization, founded in March 1979, after the Islamic Revolution, to provide support for families who are struggling financially. The aim is to help such families regain financial stability. MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
