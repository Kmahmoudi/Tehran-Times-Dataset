Elsewhere in his remarks, the president said that Israel’s expansionist and occupation policies had failed because of the resistance, particularly in Palestine. “Fall of Israel is near” During meetings with a group of Palestinian resistance leaders, commanders and intellectuals in the Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday, Raisi also said the Israeli regime is about to fall. The president added that resistance is the only means to foil plots by the Tel Aviv regime. He also emphasized the necessity of cooperation among resistance groups in the region and the larger Muslim world to swiftly overthrow the usurper regime, liberate the holy city of Al-Quds, and restore Palestinian sovereignty.
