SARANSK, Russia – Iran national football team head coach Carlos Queiroz says they have nothing to lose against Portugal and will fight for their dreams against them. Iran got off to a winning start in St Petersburg with a Moroccan own goal but then lost 1-0 to Spain in a hard-fought match in Kazan. Portugal and Spain, who take on already ousted Morocco, are on four points and only need a draw from their respective matches. Yet Iran are just a point behind and must beat Portugal to progress from group B. “For Iran national football team is an honor to be in the World Cup. We still have a chance to advance to the next stage and will fight for our dreams,” Queiroz said. “We have only one choice — to be better than Portugal in every aspect. We want to win the match and get three points,” he added. Speaking about the Iranian supporters in the two previous matches, Queiroz said, “I want to thank the supporters because we felt we are playing at our home in the two previous matches,” the ex-Portugal match stated. "Portugal are a candidate to win the World Cup but our philosophy will be the same. It will be based around respect, realism and romanticism because we have based our game around those fundamentals,” Queiroz said.
