The collection includes works by American poet Donald Justice, Indian poet Sarojini Naidu, and several other English-speaking poets from all over the world. Orthodox Archbishop Sebouh Sarkisian, the Primate of the Diocese of Tehran, is writing the introduction of the book, which has reached 400 pages so far. The book will be published under the title “Imam Hussein (AS) in Poems by English-Speaking Poets” by the Library of the Shrine of Imam Hussein (AS) in Karbala. It will also be published by Naba’ Publications in Iran. The book will also feature poems on other famous personalities involved in Ashura, like Hor, Sakineh, Roqayeh, Qasem, and Ali-Asghar. Professor Fakhr-Rohani has been compiling the collection for two years and has decided to publish it in several volumes. He believes that it would be better to publish the Persian translation of the book separately due to its size.
