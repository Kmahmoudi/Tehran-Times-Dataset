TEHRAN – Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Sunday that the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has agreed to the allocation of $500 million from the National Development Fund for pharmaceutical companies. “The Leader approved the measure last week, and there’s no problem,” Jahangiri said at a ceremony marking National Export Day, Mehr reported. He also pointed to U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the re-imposition of economic sanctions, saying the second batch of sanctions, although not due until November 4, seems to have already affected the oil, banking and transport indicators, which make the country's main sources of revenue.
