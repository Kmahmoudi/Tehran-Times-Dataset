TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday that Iran will give proper response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s approach to the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and P5+1 group and the European Union.
 Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his strong opposition to the nuclear accord and has desperately sought a pretext to scrap or weaken it, is expected not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal. The deadline for declaring the decision, according to the U.S. law, comes before October 15. Trump’s stance on the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action, comes as the International Atomic Energy Agency has verified Iran’s adherence to the terms of the nuclear agreement for eight times.  The European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has said the 27-nation bloc will remain committed to the nuclear deal with or without the United States. All international dignitaries have said the agreement which went into force in early 2016 is working well. ‘Tehran will go ahead with its regional policies regardless of rhetoric by others’ Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony marking the memory of the late President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Zarif also said Iran will follow its policies on the Middle East region regardless of rhetoric by other countries’ officials. “The truth is that it has been a long time that our region is suffering from the U.S. wrong policies. Iran is center of stability and fight against terrorism in the region and will follow its policies within this framework,” the chief diplomat noted.  He added, “Realities in the region are becoming clear for the other countries gradually.”
