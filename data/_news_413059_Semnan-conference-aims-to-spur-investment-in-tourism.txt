TEHRAN â€“ The Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Department of Semnan province, north-central Iran, will host a tourism investment conference on May 4. The event, which is to be held at Sangesar Hotel in Mahdishahr, a district near the city of Semnan, is aimed at encouraging potential financiers from both private and public sectors to flock to invest in hospitality and tourism sections across the province, CHTN reported on Sunday. Semnan is well placed to give swift access to both the Alborz Mountains and the vast Dasht-e Kavir desert, while still being an easy 240km drive by expressway from Tehran. Since Sassanian times it has been a key stop on the silk route, attracting wealth and regular destruction in equal measure. Semnan boasts of a variety of historical buildings and covered bazaars.
