TEHRAN- The head of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has issued a stark warning against seditious attempts by the U.S., the Israeli regime and their allies to foment unrest and division in Iran by instigating riots, stressing that the Islamic Republic will resolutely foil the hostile schemes. Major General Hossein Salami made the comments at a gathering of 15,000 Sistan-Baluchestan Basij members on Sunday in Zahedan, the provincial capital. The IRGC commander praised the border province's residents for their attitude of piety and patriotism and emphasized the remarkable unity and brotherhood between Shia and Sunni Muslims in the province. The enemy is attempting to engage the Basij, because the Basij can still battle the enemy, defeat them, cause them to flee, bury their hopes, and reclaim the Islamic lands from them, the top commander remarked. “Iran is currently engaged in a significant global battle,” the IRGC chief noted, stating, “With the help of their mercenaries stationed there, all of Iran's adversaries have converged on the conflict.” The major general pointed out, “The U.S., Britain, Israel, Germany, France, and the House of Saud are all trying to provoke tensions in Iran by means of their divisive media outlets. However, the Iranian nation is fully vigilant. Enemies have many pipe dreams and are living in delusions. They do not know that Iran and its Islamic establishment are fairly strong.” “Be certain that the Zionist regime will crumble, but the Islamic establishment will be safe,” he predicted, adding, “The enemy's fantasies will not be realized because the establishment is so powerful.” The IRGC head said, “The adversaries of Iran are deluded.”  “First, the adversary is vanquished by its media. The enemy is unaware of the might of our nation and the Islamic revolution.” The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declared, “Today, we must choose to be on the side of Islam or the side of unbelievers. There is no compromising.” Salami emphasized that the U.S. and Britain want to regain their political, economic, and cultural hegemony over Iran while pointing out that both nations have a long history of atrocities and aggressive behavior. The Iranian nation and security forces, he maintained, are on the opposite side of the leaders of the U.S., the UK, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. Salami continued that the Tel Aviv regime, the United States, and its allies will perish in the "great sedition and world war" that is taking place against the Islamic Republic. “The United States, which has killed tens of millions of people in several wars and exports torture devices and weapons of mass destruction, as well as Britain, which has carried out atrocities over the globe and has a colonial mindset, are currently attempting to hurt the Iranian people. But they will never succeed,” he said. He also recognized the sacrifices made by Basij members from the Islamic establishment's triumph up until this point and their crucial contribution to the protection of the populations of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen from Takfiri terrorists managed by the U.S..  Salami made reference to the current unrest in Iran, asserting that a number of nations, including the U.S., the UK, the Israeli regime, Germany, France, and Saudi Arabia, were attempting to incite unrest in Iran through their polarizing media.  "But this nation is completely aware.” The head commander of the IRGC highlighted that all Iranians are patriotic and are aware that security is a gift from God.
