TEHRAN – The Chairman of Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, has backed Ali Larijani for the post of parliament speaker in the next Majlis, claiming he just fits the job, Tasnim reported on Friday. Larijani’s main rival is the reformist-minded Mohammad Reza Aref, who topped the elections in Tehran, people familiar with the matter say. Aref, a Stanford-educated former presidential candidate and minister, also has served as vice-president to the former reformist president. Boroujerdi stated the position demands tactfulness and ability to manage all political groups. “As far as I know him, he (Larijani) is the best speakership option for the 10th parliament.” Elsewhere, Boroujerdi hailed Larijani as the right figure to take the influential seat for holding “correct and exact foreign policies,” having contributed to country’s foreign policy. This is the first time a senior principlist parliamentarian openly backs Larijani’s speakership after the February parliamentary elections. While Boroujerdi has spoken in support of Larijani, citing criteria, he has not elaborated on how and why other possible candidates, including the reformist Aref, do not meet his standards. Larijani, who won a re-election in the religious city of Qom in the Feb. elections, has been the parliament speaker since 8 years ago when the 8th parliament opened.   AK/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
