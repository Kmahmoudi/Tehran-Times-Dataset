TEHRAN – Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, Iran's prosecutor general, said on Thursday that the CIA, the Zionists and Saudi Arabia were behind the recent unrest in various cities across the country.  The plan had been prepared and masterminded some four years ago with close cooperation of those countries, Montazeri was quoted by IRNA as saying.  He added that the main projector of the plan was an American national named Michael Andrea, a former CIA member in charge of combatting terrorism that formed the group to create unrest in the Islamic Republic.
