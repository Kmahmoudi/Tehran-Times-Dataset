TEHRAN – The Iranian Army issued a statement on Saturday calling the country’s defense industry a “symbol of self-confidence and self-esteem”.
 The defense industry is one of the most important components in protecting the country’s “independence” and “territorial integrity”, the statement said. It said that the national defense industry has some “valuable characteristics” such as “reliance on national and domestic capabilities” and “using revolutionary determination and will to realize the talents”. “The country’ defense industry has turned into a role model in spite of permanent and comprehensive animosity of the global arrogance against the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian nation and imposition of cruel sanctions during the past 37 years,” the Army said. It added that the defense industry has turned into a symbol of “national power” by succeeding to develop technologically advanced systems. Elsewhere, the Army said the defense industry proves that preemptive power and resistance are the main reasons behind the “strategic defeat” of the arrogant powers. The statement also congratulated Defense Industry Day which falls on 21 August. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
