TEHRAN – Relations with international publishers have improved since the lifting of world sanctions against Iran that came after the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) earlier last year, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Reza Salehi-Amiri told reporters in a visit to the 30th Tehran International Book Fair on Thursday.

 “International publishing companies participating in the book fair have increased in number after the JCPOA implementation,” he said.   “A more suitable atmosphere has been prepared for publishers at the event to promote their latest offerings,” he added. 
    
He said that publishers from China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, India and many other countries have an active participation in the book fair, which is Iran’s major event in publishing industry. Italy is the special guest of the book fair, which opened last week with the motto of “Let’s Read One More Book”.
