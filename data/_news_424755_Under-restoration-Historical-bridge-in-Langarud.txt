TEHRAN – A centuries-old brick bridge in Langarud, northern Iran, is being restored, CHTN reported on Sunday. Some 70 percent of the rehabilitation project, which commenced some 20 days ago, has been completed so far and restores are to take down scaffolding poles, the report said. The arch bridge, made over the Langarud River, dates from the Safavid era (1501–1736).
