TEHRAN - Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani on Tuesday congratulated the Syrian government, people and army over the liberation of Aleppo.
 However, he said, “Military victories cannot be an alternate to a political solution based on dialogue among the government and the armed Syrian groups to reach a national reconciliation.” Iran is insistent on the need to adopt political approaches to settle the Syrian conflict, he added. A ceasefire between government troops and the rebels was declared in Aleppo on Tuesday. NA/PA
