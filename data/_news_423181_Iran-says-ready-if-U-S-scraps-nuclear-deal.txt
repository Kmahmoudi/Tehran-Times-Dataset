TEHRAN - Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Wednesday that Iran is ready if the U.S. scraps the 2015 nuclear deal.
 “We are ready for change in the country’s situation when the U.S. administration pulls out of the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action],” he explained. In a statement on January 12, U.S. President Donald Trump gave Europeans only 120 days to agree to an overhaul of the nuclear agreement and said if the text of the deal is not revised he would unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from it. The deadline falls on May 12. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
