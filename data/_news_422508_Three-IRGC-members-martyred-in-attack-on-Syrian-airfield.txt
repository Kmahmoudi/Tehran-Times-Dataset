TEHRAN – Iranian media on Monday evening reported that least three members of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) had been martyred in a deadly attack on a Syrian military airport. The Iranian Foreign Ministry has denounced the attack, holding Israel responsible. “This is the violation of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity” of Syria and “runs counter to international law and regulations,” the Foreign Ministry stated. Fars news agency reported that three “defenders of the holy shrine,” who had been dispatched from Tabriz, Ahwaz and Qom, were martyred in Israeli aircraft attack on Syria’s T-4 airfield in Homs province. Shrine defenders is a phrase that Iran uses for its advisers sent to Syria to aid the Syrian army against terrorists. Two F-15 aircraft from the Israeli air force delivered a strike against Syria’s T-4 airfield with eight guided missiles on Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry said. No Russian advisers were among the casualties. Syria initially blamed the U.S. for the strike. Observers said 14 people were killed in the attack. The Lebanese army said four Israeli warplanes violated Lebanon's air space, flying from the Mediterranean Sea over the coastal town of Jounieh and then heading east, toward the city of Baalbek near the Syrian border. A statement from the Lebanese Armed Forces says the warplanes stayed in Lebanese airspace for about 10 minutes, starting at 3:25 am on Monday before leaving.
