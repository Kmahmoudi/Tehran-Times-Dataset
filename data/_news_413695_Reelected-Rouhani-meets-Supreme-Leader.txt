TEHRAN – Hassan Rouhani, who was reelected president in the May 19 presidential election, met on Tuesday with Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
 Prior to the meeting, Rouhani also visited the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini to renew his allegiance to the causes of the Islamic Revolution. Rouhani won a landslide victory in the polls, garnering 23,549,616 votes out of a total of 41,22,131.  The turnout was unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Revolution. According to the Interior Ministry, about 70 of the electorate participated in the elections. The polls were held simultaneously with municipal elections.    “Imam Khomeini (RA) taught us that the revolution is protected by the people. We could not protect the system and revolution if it were not for the elections, ballot boxes and the people’s presence at ballot boxes,” he said in the mausoleum. He added, “If we are proud of the elections and the people’s participation, it is because of the path Imam Khomeini (RA) showed us. He always insisted on the people’s participation in determining their future.”  Rouhani also said that he will fulfil all the promises he made to people in his campaigns. “We are hopeful about the country’s future. We will win if we follow the path of jihad and endeavor,” he pointed out. NA/PA
