TEHRAN – Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said on Wednesday that only the Syrian people can decide their future, criticizing the United States for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.  Boroujerdi criticized Washington for acting as the world’s sheriff, saying this is a “modern dictatorship” which has caused the Americans’ consecutive failures in the region. He also denied claims that Iran, Turkey and Russia have agreed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must go, saying Syria is an independent country which will decide its own fate, ISNA reported.
