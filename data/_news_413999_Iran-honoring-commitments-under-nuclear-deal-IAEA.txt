TEHRAN – The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that Iran has been honoring its commitments under a nuclear agreement it signed with six world powers in 2015, Reuters reported. According to a quarterly report by the atomic watchdog, Iran’s stock of low-enriched uranium as of May 27 was 79.8 kg (175.5 pounds), well below a 202.8-kg (446-pound) limit, and the level of enrichment did not exceed a 3.67 percent cap. “Everything is running smoothly at this point in time,” said one senior diplomat, pointing to Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, officially known as the JCPOA. This is the second report that the IAEA issued since U.S. President Donald Trump assumed office in January.  Trump has referred to the nuclear accord as “the worst deal ever negotiated” and vowed to tear it up once in office. Since his inauguration, however, he has been warned against doing so by the international community. Senior Iranian officials have also dismissed Trump’s inconsistent stance on the issue, saying Tehran reserves the right to “act accordingly” if Washington reconsiders the nuclear deal. Iran “is fully prepared to return to the pre-JCPOA situation or even [to conditions] more robust than that if the U.S. reneges on its promises to the extent that the JCPOA’s continuation harms our national interests,” Zarif said in March.
