TEHRAN – Iran’s embassy in Dushanbe issued a statement on Wednesday dismissing anti-Iran claims in a documentary aired by Tajikistan’s state television, saying the strong affinity between Iran and Tajikistan cannot be harmed.
 “There is no doubt that producers of this documentary will not succeed in causing harm to cultural and friendly relations between the Iranian and Tajik people,” the statement read. The televised program, which was aired on Tuesday, accused Iran of involvement in Tajikistan’s 1992-97 civil war and murder of a series of Tajik political figures. The statement said, “The Tajik people will not forget Iran’s role in guaranteeing peace in Tajikistan and hosting talks among the warring sides to end civil war in Tajikistan in 90s.” Iran’s actions in helping Tajikistan build infrastructures have no meaning but helping peace and security in Tajikistan, the statement added. “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s performance in fighting terrorism is clear for the whole world like sunshine,” the statement noted. The statement also said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s embassy [in Dushanbe] believes that divisive actions are not within the framework the two nations’ interests and the acts are being taken by those who cannot tolerate brotherly relations between Iran and Tajikistan.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
