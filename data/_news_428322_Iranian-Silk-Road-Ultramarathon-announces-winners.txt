TEHRAN – Winners have been announced for the 3rd Iranian Silk Road Ultramarathon, which commenced on September 29 as a tourism event across the UNESCO-registered Lut Desert famed for being one of hottest places on earth. Iranian athletes Akbar Naqdi and Hossein-Ali Shikh-Langi and Italian runner Alberto Tagliabue were ranked first to third respectively, in the section “Integral 250 km”, according to http://worldrunningacademy.com. Samuele Perez from Italy and Isobel Grace Tanaka and Kate Macintosh both from New Zealand slipped from first to third in the section “Lite 150 km”. According to the organizers, the “Integral 250 km” comprised stages of 35/45 km per day with a long section of 70 km, and the “Lite 150 km” was composed of 6 stages of 20/30 km per day with a long section of 40 km. Some 20 runners from Italy, Germany, South Africa, Japan, New Zealand and Iran competed in the ultramarathon that started from Mahan Air’s campsite in Malekabad village of Shahdad District in Kerman province and passed through Shafiabad castle, valley of Dolphins, Gandom Beryan, Rudshour, Howz-e Nader caravanserai and came to an end in Zavar village. The race took place in total safety considerations, with medical and nursing staff present at checkpoints about every 10 kilometers path and tented camps. “Undoubtedly, holding such events makes the region more popular,” Mehr quoted Kerman province’s tourism chief Gholamreza Farrokhi as saying on September 23. Seven years of satellite temperature data analyzed by NASA has shown that the Lut Desert is the hottest spot on Earth. Based on the research, it was hottest during 5 of the 7 years, and had the highest temperature overall: 70.7°C in 2005. The big and sprawling Kerman province has been a cultural melting pot since antiquity, blending Persians with subcontinental tribe dwellers. It is home to myriad historical sites and scenic landscapes such as Bazaar-e Sartasari, Jabalieh Dome, Ganjali Khan Bathhouse, Malek Jameh Mosque and Shahdad desert to name a few.
