Ukraine has downgraded diplomatic ties with Iran and stripped its ambassador of his accreditation over what it called Tehran’s “unfriendly” decision to supply Russian forces with drones. “Supplying Russia with weapons to wage war against Ukraine is an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to relations between Ukraine and Iran,” said a statement on the foreign ministry’s website, the Guardian reported. “In response to such an unfriendly act the Ukrainian side has decided to deprive the ambassador of Iran of his accreditation and also to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic staff of the Iranian embassy in Kyiv.” The message was handed to Iran’s acting ambassador since the permanent envoy, Manouchehr Moradi, is not currently in Ukraine.
