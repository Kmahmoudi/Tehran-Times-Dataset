TEHRAN - Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Monday that Europeans should play a more independent role which will be more beneficial to them.
 In a meeting with Sigmar Gabriel, the former German foreign minister, Larijani said, “U.S. President’s [Donald Trump] behavior has caused chaos at the international arena and also caused problems for the Europeans.” Larijani also said that Iran-Europe ties have been promoted after the clinching of the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Gabriel said that Europeans are firm to keep the nuclear deal after the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in May. Gabriel said that there are many small and mid-sized companies in Germany which are not dependent on the U.S. and are willing to cooperate with Iran. Elsewhere, he said that Germany has problems with Saudi kingdom and has even stopped selling weapons to the country. However, he said that Saudi Arabia receives message from the White House. Commenting on Yemeni crisis, he criticized lack of attention to killing of the Yemeni kids.
