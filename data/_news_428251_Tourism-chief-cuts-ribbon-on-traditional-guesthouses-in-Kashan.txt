TEHRAN – Iran’s tourism chief Ali-Asghar Mounesan inaugurated three traditional guesthouses during his visit to the central city of Kashan on Thursday. The three have been repurposed from somewhat abandoned historical structures, after being restored by the private sector under the auspices of the Revitalization and Utilization Fund for Historical Places, CHTN reported. “Historic houses are of high importance for Iranians as they bear parts of our history, civilization and culture,” he said. The official also underlined that eco-lodges and traditional guesthouses are well catering to hospitality industry in the country.  “Paying attention to these historical structures through refurbishing and reviving them can preserve those [for the successive generations] and can be tuned into attractive and enjoyable places for both domestic and foreign tourists.” Upon an initiative scheme, the Fund (known by its Persian acronym Saabta) provides opportunity for privately-owned businesses to run certain old structures in order to be maintained and repurposed into hotels, traditional restaurants or lodging places. Iran is home to abundant historical mansions, caravanserais, bathhouses, madrasas, and other massive monuments, which can buttress its budding tourism and hospitality sectors if managed appropriately and refurbished properly.
