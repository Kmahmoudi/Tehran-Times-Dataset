TEHRAN – Luis Arce, the Bolivian president-elect, has said that his government will reactivate bilateral relations and cooperation with Iran that were stagnant during the interim government. Arce made the remarks during a meeting with the Iranian Ambassador in Bolivia Morteza Tafreshi, Mehr reported on Saturday. The two sides discussed prospects of cooperation between the two countries. Arce thanked the Iranian president and foreign minister for their congratulatory messages over his victory in the election. Referring to the friendly relations between the two nations of Iran and Bolivia, he expressed hope that Iran would continue to cooperate and support the new Bolivian government in technical, scientific, and industrial fields. Arce, the left-wing candidate of the Movement for Socialism (MAS) party, won the October 27 election with more than 55 percent of the vote and he will take power next week. According to al Jazeera, Bolivia’s outgoing parliament on Thursday approved a motion recommending that ex-interim president Jeanine Anez and her ministers face justice for responsibility over last year’s unrest which left around 30 people dead. The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, meeting in joint session, approved a parliamentary report on the “massacres of Senkata, Sacaba, and Yapacani, which recommends a judgment of responsibility against Jeanine Anez for genocide and other offenses”, according to the Senate’s Twitter account. Parliament also approved the criminal indictment of 11 ministers. A parliamentary commission, controlled by the MAS party of former President Evo Morales, spent months investigating incidents that took place in several regions of the country between October and November 2019, which left about 30 dead. It presented its report on Tuesday, a little over a week after new socialist President Arce, the MAS candidate, took power. An investigation by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission (CIDH) found that 35 people were killed in these incidents. The unrest came after Morales won a fourth term in an election that sparked weeks of protests and charges of fraud. Morales was forced to resign on November 10 before going into exile in Mexico and then Argentina. Conservative former senator Anez assumed power as interim president after Morales fled. Senate president Eva Copa, a member of MAS, specified that the report would be submitted to the Bolivian prosecution for opening possible proceedings. She is also counting on the fact that the report will likely be approved by the new parliament, where the MAS retains its majority and which is due to take office next week.
