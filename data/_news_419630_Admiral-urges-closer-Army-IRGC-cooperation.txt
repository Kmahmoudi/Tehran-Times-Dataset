TEHRAN - Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, the former commander of the Iranian Navy, said on Saturday that the Army and Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) should expand cooperation to counter the enemies.
 “Unity is the key to victory and the Armed Forces including Army, Guards, police forces and Basij should join hands to protect the Islamic system from the enemies’ harms,” said Sayyari, who now acts as the Army coordinator. He noted that it is a responsibility of all to defend the country’s territorial integrity and independence. “To protect our country from any threat, we should be present in airspace, sea and land borders to nip any threat in the bud and prevent aggression against our country,” the admiral added. The former Navy chief noted that the enemies have made any efforts to hatch plots to weaken Iran, however, they have not been successful.
