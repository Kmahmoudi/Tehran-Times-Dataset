TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi reconfirmed on Wednesday that Iran has received no invitation from the Saudi government for Hajj rituals.
 However, he said, “The issue will be discussed by the related organizations and bodies after receiving an invitation.”  Hamid Mohammadi, the new head of Iran's Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization, on Sunday dismissed reports that Saudi Arabia has invited Iran to discuss a resumption of Iranians’ participation in Hajj rituals. “Contrary to the report published by some media outlets regarding an invitation by Saudi Arabia for Iran’s participation in this year’s Hajj rituals, we have received no invitation,” Mohammadi said. Iran stopped sending people to Hajj after 464 of its pilgrimage were killed in a stamped in September 2015.  Iranian officials accused Riyadh of being incapable of managing the annual event, holding the country accountable for the disaster. After Saudi Arabia refused to give guarantees that such incidents would not happen again Iran stopped sending pilgrims to the country. Saudi Arabia also cut diplomatic ties with Iran after mobs - angry over the execution of pro-democracy cleric Sheik Nimr Baqr al-Nimr in January 2016 - attacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran and its consular office in Mashhad.
