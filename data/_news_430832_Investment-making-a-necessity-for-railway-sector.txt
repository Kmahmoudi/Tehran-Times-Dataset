TEHRAN- Managing Director of Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (known as RAI) Saeed Mohammadzadeh said that development in the railway sector of the country is in need of large investment makings, IRNA reported. Making the remarks in a ceremony held at the place of RAI on Tuesday to celebrate the National Transportation Week that was participated by the Transport Minister Mohammad Eslami, the official underscored that the Sixth Five-Year National Development Plan (2016-2021) has seriously stressed development of railways. He further expressed hope that through the underway planning, transportation of cargo via railways will jump in the country in the next Iranian calendar year (starts on March 21, 2019). As Mohammadzadeh said on October, some €20 billion is needed to supply the required infrastructure for development of national railway network by March 2021. “According to the set programs, 54 percent of the needed investments will be made by the private sector and the rest will be supplied by the government,” he added.
