TEHRAN - Investment potentials in Iran’s health sector were introduced to British investors in a meeting held in London on July 4, IRNA reported. The one-day meeting was held by the British-Iranian Chamber of Commerce (BICC) and the UK’s Department for International Trade. The event also discussed investment opportunities in the Iranian pharmaceutical, life sciences and humanitarian sectors, the BICC website reported. Iran has a nearly €100 billion healthcare sector primarily EU dominated with pharmaceuticals alone being worth close to €2 billion, the report added.
