 On Friday, it was reported that Britain, France and Germany have proposed fresh EU sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles and its role in Syria’s to try to persuade Donald Trump to preserve a 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said, “In case some European countries are seeking non-nuclear sanctions on Iran to appease the American president are making a big miscalculation and they will see its direct impact on the JCPOA and its survival.” He added, “It is better that European countries continue their current action to persuade America to keep its commitments based on the nuclear deal and for that country to effectively execute the deal in its entirety with good will and in a productive atmosphere.” The senior diplomat stressed, “If America exits the deal and unilateral sanctions return, we will definitely not continue the deal because it will not serve our interests.”  SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
