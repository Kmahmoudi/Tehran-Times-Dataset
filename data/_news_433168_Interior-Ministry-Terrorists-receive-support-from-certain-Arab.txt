TEHRAN – The director general of the Interior Ministry for border Affairs has said parts of Pakistan’s common borders with Iran are swarming with terrorist groups which receive financial support from certain Western and Arab states. Shahriar Heydari pointed to the recent terrorist attack on IRGC forces, saying the enemies’ plots for Iran is much more than such rare terrorist attacks inside Iran, the YJC reported on Tuesday. “Such suicide acts are nothing considering the high level of the enemies’ threats against our country,” he remarked, adding that suicide attacks occur easily all around the world.
