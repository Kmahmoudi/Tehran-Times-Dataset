TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has condemned the Bahraini government for sentencing a prominent cleric to one year in prison, expressing concern over the crackdown of civil rights activists. Sheikh Isa Qassim, the spiritual leader of the country’s Shiite majority, was sentenced by a Bahraini court to a one-year suspended prison sentence on Sunday. The court also seized assets belonging to Sheikh Qassim as part of an ongoing crackdown on dissent in the kingdom. In a statement issued on Sunday, Qassemi called on the Bahraini authorities to end their fight against freedom of expression and try to engage in a dialogue with the Bahraini people.   “Bahraini people have followed his example of peaceful behavior and are protesting against restriction put on their religious leader,” he said. Bahraini authorities stripped Qassim of his citizenship last June over accusations that he used his position to serve foreign interests and promote “sectarianism” and “violence.” He has denied the allegations.  The top cleric’s followers had urged protesters to gather in mosques across the country ahead of the court ruling, but the protests were peaceful. Since 2011, the Arab country has been grappling with widespread protests against the ruling al-Khalifa’s abuse of power and violation of Bahraini people’s rights.  The regime has suppressed the protests with the help of forces from neighboring Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
