God-worshipping Iranian Muslims held Eid al-Fitr Prayers across the country in high glory on Wednesday in a sign of celebrating one month of fasting, serving and praying to Almighty God. The culmination of this presence and thanksgiving ceremony was at Imam Khomeini Grand Prayer Ground in Tehran, where Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei led the prayers.    

 In the first sermon succeeding the prayers, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution offered congratulations to the Iranian nation and the large Islamic Ummah on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr. Describing this year’s holy fasting month of Ramadan as a month of spirituality, attention, resort, humbleness and supplication, Ayatollah Khamenei said: “We, officials, must envy the illuminated hearts of these faithful people and of course we must be grateful to God. However, we must keep in mind what a heavy responsibility we shoulder vis-à-vis faithful people of the country.”    Ayatollah Khamenei said fasting by people, particularly by youths and young adults, during the longest and the hottest days of the year were among the beautiful manifestations of the holy month of Ramadan this year, adding: “Of course, certain wicked hands sought [in vain] to drive young adults to flout fasting, but thanks to God, they failed and they will fail again in the future.” “This issue must call people and officials in the country once more to attention about the schemes the infamous enemies of Islamic Iran are plotting to drive the growing generation away from religion, but schemes by ill-wishers this year ended in failure thanks to people’s vigilance.”    The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said the massive International Quds Day rally (on the last Friday of Ramadan in support of Palestine) under searing heat, particularly in southern provinces of Iran, was another beautiful manifestation and another major act of diligence by people during holy Ramadan, adding: “Through this massive presence and shouting [slogans] about the important issue of Palestine, people in fact announced that [even] if certain Muslim governments are betraying the Palestinian cause or some governments are shirking from their responsibilities or some nations are unaware of this issue, the Iranian nation is ready to stand against all enemies and revive the issue of Palestine.” “Unfortunately, this year in some countries, the Muslims’ Eid al-Fitr turned into mourning by terrorists who intend to replace ‘genuine Islam” with ‘fabricated and fake Islam’ at the order of their masters, and these crimes result from the nurturing of terrorists by security services of the U.S., England and the Zionist regime [of Israel],” Leader says. Ayatollah Khamenei said this year’s Ramadan was a large exhibition of the manifestations and signs of spirituality of people. Referring to glorious Quranic recitation forums in holy shrines, which were covered in the best manner on national media, Ayatollah Khamenei added: “Another of these manifestations was the expanding function of Iftar (fast-breaking meal) by people in different cities particularly in various districts in Tehran. Fairly speaking, this spirituality and spirit of serving people do affect everyone.”    The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said the favorable tradition of Iftars by people countered extravagant and luxurious Iftars, noting: “I regret to say that certain organs proceeded with the ugly function of costly Iftars in the hotels for unqualified people. I have to say that simple Iftars distributed by people to the needy and passers-by stand against this issue.” Ayatollah Khamenei cited “distribution of Iftar among the needy by the youth describing themselves as ‘devoted distributors’”, “holding glorious prayer forums at mosques, Hosseiniyas and the martyrs’ tombs particularly during vigils”, “the expanding and blessed tradition of Itikaf (isolation) during the final ten-day period of Ramada” and “free practice of medicine by certain doctors during Ramadan” as other beautiful manifestations of the holy month, noting: “Such Ramadan will definitely attract divine compassion.” Arrogant powers seek to plunge the issue of Palestine into oblivion In the second sermon, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the terrorist blasts that struck Iraq, Turkey, Bangladesh and some other countries in recent days, saying: “Unfortunately, this year in some countries, the Muslims’ Eid al-Fitr turned into mourning by terrorists who intend to replace ‘genuine Islam” with ‘fabricated and fake Islam’ at the order of their masters, and these crimes result from the nurturing of terrorists by security services of the U.S., England and the Zionist regime [of Israel].”   Ayatollah Khamenei laid emphasis on the fact that the massacre of innocent humans in the region is blamed on the supporters of Takfiri terrorists who are themselves suffering gradually from terrorism. But, noted the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, this sin and crime committed by them will not be forgotten.    The Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the outbreak of war and insecurity in regional countries including Syria, Libya and Yemen as a cause of regret, adding: “It is now one year and three months that the people in Yemen are under bombing, but we have to praise this people and their wise leadership because they held glorious International Quds Day rally under such conditions and in hot weather.” Additionally, the Leader stressed that the main objective sought by arrogant powers in waging war and triggering insecurity and terrorism in the region is to push the issue of Palestine into oblivion, adding, “Struggling for the freedom of Palestine is an Islamic and public struggle and the continuation of this drive is a task assigned to all Muslims and it would be wrong to limit the issue of Palestine to the framework of a domestic and merely Arabic issue.” Inflated salaries is betrayal of the revolution Wrapping up the second sermon, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the issue of unfair and unjust inflated salaries and money withdrawals and stressing the fact that such illegitimate withdrawals from public wealth constitute a sin and amount to treason against the ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Khamenei added: “In this issue, there has definitely been negligence and neglect in the past that must be compensated [now], but officials must seriously follow up on the issue of illegitimate salaries and it must not be so that the issue would slip into oblivion after a hue and cry.”   The Leader of the Islamic Revolution heaped praise on President Hassan Rouhani and the heads of the legislature and the judiciary for their positions in dealing with this ugly phenomenon, saying: “In this issue, the illegitimate payments must be restituted and those who have violated the law must be punished and those who have misused the law must be dismissed because they do not deserve being appointed in [such] centers and posts.” Reiterating that the enemies of the Islamic Republic establishment are trying to take advantage of this issue for pushing ahead with their campaign against the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khamenei said: “Those who have received illegitimate payments are few, when compared with clean-handed managers in [the Islamic] establishment, but even [the existence of] this few is harmful and a flaw which must be removed.” The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said one reason behind the occurrence of the ugly phenomenon of illegitimate salaries was the fall-out from “aristocratic inebriety” and noted: “When in the society, ‘aristocracy, extravagance and luxury [lifestyle] are spread, the result will be the emergence of ugly phenomena like illegitimate payments.” Underscoring the need for serious action against this issue, Ayatollah Khamenei said: “This issue of dismissal and restitution of assets to state coffers must top the agenda of officials because public opinion is sensitive to this issue and if this issue is not followed up on, people’s confidence in the Islamic establishment will decline.” The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said the decline of people’s trust in the Islamic establishment would be a catastrophe, noting: “Officials must preserve people’s trust by follow-up and firm action.” (Source: leader.ir)
