TEHRAN – The Ministry of Education has developed a plan to build small sports halls in girls’ schools, Deputy Education Minister Rezvan Hakimzadeh said here on Saturday. Constructing sports halls, in an area of 250sqm, follows the goal of fulfilling national “document on fundamental transformation of education and physical education”, IRNA quoted Hakimzadeh as saying. The measure helps physical education enjoy its significance, especially for girl students, who are much restricted, the official added. The whole society will benefit from girl students’ sports, because today’s healthy girl students will become tomorrow’s happy mothers, Hakimzadeh noted. Suitable sports areas, good teachers and proper contexts are the three complementary elements to be considered in improving physical activities of girl students, she stated.
