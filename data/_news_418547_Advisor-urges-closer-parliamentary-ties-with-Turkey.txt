TEHRAN – Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, met on Tuesday with Turkey’s ambassador to Tehran to discuss expansion of parliamentary relations and closer coordination between the two neighbors. Amir Abdollahian and the Turkish envoy Reza Hakan Tekin called for efforts to boost relations between the two neighbors. Pointing to an upcoming meeting of the Asian Parliamentary Assembly (APA), which will be held in Istanbul next week, Amir Abdollahian said closer parliamentary ties can help strengthen actions against regional challenges, including terrorism.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
