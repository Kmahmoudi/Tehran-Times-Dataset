TEHRAN – “Yeva”, a co-production between Iran’s Farabi Cinema Foundation and the National Cinema Center of Armenia, premiered at the Moscow Cinema in the Armenian capital of Yerevan on Saturday. Directed by Iranian-Armenian filmmaker Anahid Abad, the film tells the story of Yeva, a young woman who escapes her influential in-laws with her daughter Nareh, after her husband’s tragic death, and takes refuge in one of the villages of Karabakh, Armenia.  Farabi director Alireza Tabesh and National Cinema Center of Armenia director Shushanik Mirzakhanyan also attended the screening of the film. Before the screening, Tabesh said that Iran is ready to collaborate with neighboring countries on joint film productions. “The cinema of Iran can pave the ground for cinematic growth based on morality through joint productions not only with Armenia but also with the neighboring countries with shared commonalities,” he added. Tabesh expressed his hope that the ideal conditions for expanding relations on cinema between Iran and Armenia are created. He also announced Iran’s readiness to organize mutual film weeks. On her part, Abad expressed thanks to her Iranian colleagues, especially producer Taqi Aliqolizadeh, and said that the film shows the high potential of Iranian cinema and Armenia artists.  The film, which is on screen at three movie theaters in Yerevan with Persian subtitles, will later go on screen in other Armenian cities: Gyumri, Ashtarak and Goris. In addition, in a meeting held on Monday at the Armenia Ministry of Culture, Tabesh and Mirzakhanyan signed an agreement to expand ties in cinematic fields.
