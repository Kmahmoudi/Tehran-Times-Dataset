TEHRAN- Fuad Hussein, the Foreign Minister of Iraq, stated on Saturday that his nation wanted to see more advancement in international negotiations about Iran's nuclear program and Saudi Arabia's ties with Tehran. "The dispute between Iran and the U.S. reflects on Iraqi land, in Iraqi politics, and in Iraqi culture. It is in our interest to help if we can or to encourage both parties to continue the negotiations in Vienna," Hussein told the Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain.  As a result of its longstanding friendship with both countries and its strong connections with them, the Iraqi foreign minister declared Baghdad could easily communicate with Iranian and American officials. “As we are going to enter a perilous position, we are concerned about the tensions between Iran and the U.S.,” he added.  Hussein stated that the new Iraqi government will continue to press for dialogue in regards to Baghdad resuming its roles as a mediator to ease tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. “There are still some unresolved concerns, but both Saudi Arabia and Iran want to continue the conversation,” he pointed out. Over the past two years, Baghdad has played host to a number of rounds of negotiations between Tehran and Riyadh. The administration of former Prime Minister Mustafa Al Kadhimi, which ruled until last month, sought to transform Iraq's reputation into a platform for cooperation. “It is essential to building regional stability to find long-term solutions to the crises of the Middle East (West Asia), such as the Palestine issue, the situations in Yemen and Libya,” Hussein concluded.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
