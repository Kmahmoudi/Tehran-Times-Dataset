TEHRAN _ Recently, European leaders called on two top German politicians, Merkel and Steinmeier, to formulate a coalition government as soon as possible. The lack of a strong government in Germany has worried the European Union. Social Democrats and Christian Democrats are now entering a new stage in the formation of a coalition government in Berlin. Although the Social-Democratic Party has somewhat retreated from its previous position, a strong government will not be established in Berlin even if a coalition government is formed between the two Social Democratic and Christian Democrats. Therefore, the European Union and the euro area must prepare themselves to accept the new Germany. Certainly in the new era, Merkel would no longer be a major chancellor in the top of his country's political and executive equations. The German Chancellor will give many concessions to the Social Democratic Party to maintain its coalition government. “Europe needs a strong Germany, it is desirable to get a government in place quickly,” Merkel told a regional party meeting in northern Germany, adding, however, that her acting government could carry on day to day business. “Asking voters to go to the polls again would, I think be totally wrong,” she said. On Monday, Merkel had said she would prefer new elections to a minority government in which her party would be only held in power by others. In other hand, Germany's Social Democrats have given the green light for their party to enter preliminary coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's party in a vote that could trigger an end to the country's political deadlock. More than 600 SPD delegates gathered on Thursday in Berlin and debated the question for several hours before voting overwhelmingly for the exploratory talks to begin. In a speech earlier in the day, party chief Martin Schulz -- who is facing a vote on his own leadership later on Thursday -- called for a "yes" vote in spite of significant misgivings. As CNN reported, Schulz had ruled out entering a coalition with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) -- the so-called "Grand Coalition" that has ruled Germany for the last four years -- but has recently retreated from his position. "It's not about the question of Grand Coalition or no Grand Coalition, minority government or no minority government," he said on Thursday. "No, it's about the question: how can we live up to our responsibility, both today and towards the next generation?" He insisted that the party would not enter a new coalition without policy concessions from Merkel. "Governing cannot come at any price," he said.
The news comes after nearly three weeks of deadlock following the collapse of coalition talks between Merkel's alliance, the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the Green Party after federal elections in September. In a bid to avoid the possibility of fresh elections, Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier stepped in to break the deadlock, issuing what Schulz described as a "dramatic appeal" for his party to consider coalition talks. Formal talks between the parties are unlikely to start until the new year. Merkel has repeatedly insisted on a strong government in Germany. However, in the event of a coalition of two Social Democratic and Christian Democrats, we will not see a strong government in the head of the political and administrative equations of Germany. Undoubtedly, in the near future there will be great differences between the two traditional German parties. These differences will be in the social, political, security, economic and foreign policy areas. For example, there is a very serious disagreement between Merkel and the leaders of the Social-Democratic Party in terms of how Germany operates in NATO. The Social Democrats believe that Merkel surrendered to NATO's trampolines and would not resist the White House. This issue has been one of the issues between Merkel and his rival in the election (Martin Schulz). Finally, many European countries are waiting for the formation of a coalition government in Germany. However, many analysts from the German and European affairs believe that a coalition of two Social Democrats and Christian Democrats can not establish a strong government in Berlin. In other words, we will not see a strong government in Berlin in the near future. This is the worst possible news for German supporters in Europe.
