TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has pardoned or commuted the sentences of 582 inmates on the eve of Eid al-Ghadir.
 The clemency was granted at the request of Judiciary Chief Sadeq Larijani. Repeated on similar occasions, the clemency has become a manifestation of Islamic forgiveness. Article 110 of the Constitution grants the Leader the right to pardon or reduce the sentences of convicts upon a recommendation from the head of the Judiciary. NA/PA
