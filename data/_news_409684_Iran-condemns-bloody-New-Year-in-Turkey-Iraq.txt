TEHRAN – Iran condemned on Sunday terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Baghdad and Najaf, saying the blasts are the result of an instrumental use of terrorism.  “Instrumental use of violence and terrorism, and applying double standards have caused the global scourge to cross geographical, political, ethical, and religious borders and to continue its disgraceful life,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in an announcement. Counter-terrorism efforts won’t bear fruit unless all countries join hands, the announcement said, wishing for a “violence-free world” in 2017.  Terrorist attacks in Turkey and Iraq left dozens killed and some more wounded over the past two days.  On Sunday, a gunman opened fire on New Year revelers at a popular night club in Istanbul, leaving at least 39 killed and more than sixty wounded, Turkish media reported. Iran’s embassy in Turkey has not commented on if any Iranian national has been killed or wounded during the attack.  The attack happened on the shores of Istanbul's Bosphorus waterway over an hour into the New Year.  In separate attacks in Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Najaf, more than 30 people were killed. Three back-to-back blasts on Saturday left 29 people killed in the capital Baghdad.  Also, on Sunday, an ISIS-claimed attack on an Iraqi police checkpoint near the southern city of Najaf killed seven policemen.   AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
