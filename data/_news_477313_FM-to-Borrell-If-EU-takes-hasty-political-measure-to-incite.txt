TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian threatened on Wednesday that if the European Union takes a “hasty political measure” that would provoke rioters in Iran, the Islamic Republic will respond accordingly. Amir Abdollahian made the remarks in a telephone conversation with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.  “If the European Union takes a hasty political measure based on baseless allegations in line with inciting rioters and terrorists who have targeted the lives and properties of the people of Iran, we will give a reciprocal response,” Amir Abdollahian asserted. Protests erupted in certain Iranian cities after Masha Amini, a 22-year-old girl, fainted at a Tehran police station in mid-September and died later in hospital. Though top Iranian officials have vowed thorough investigation into Amini’s death the rioters are using her death as an excuse to vent anger at the Islamic Republic system by launching deadly attacks against security forces, including policemen. The foreign minister went on to say that Iran will seriously investigate the Amini case in order to cast light on the pros and cons of her death. “The Judiciary has decisively put the issue on its agenda. Soon a precise scientific report will be released by the forensic medicine” Amir Abdollahian stated.  The foreign minister went on to say that Iran considers “peaceful protests as people’s rights and always pays attention to it” but those rioters who put ambulances on fire, destroy banks and attack police with knives and guns or commit terrorist acts will be dealt with decisively in accordance with law. For his part, Borrell said violence and terrorism are different from peaceful protests, adding violent acts should receive proper response, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said. He also said the European bloc doesn’t intend its relations with Iran to face a problem.  Borrell and Amir Abdollahian exchange views about nuclear talks The EU’s Borrell and Amir Abdollahian also exchanged views about the latest developments surrounding the talks intended to lift sanctions on Iran by reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Amir Abdollahian also said Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have made a good agreement to cooperate with each other and thanked Borrell and his deputy Enrique Moral for their constructive efforts to lift sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Iran’s foreign minister visited New York in September to attend the annual UN conference. While there he held talks with many counterparts and other dignitaries. His meeting with dignitaries mainly focused on the talks intended to revive the JCPOA. “In New York indirect messages were actively traded between Iran and the U.S., and in general we had progressive talks in New York and Vienna.” Iran’s nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami also attended the annual IAEA meeting in Vienna. He held bilateral talks with IAEA director general Rafael Grossi. Borrell also expressed joy over progresses made in lifting sanction and insisted on continuation of talks to achieve a final deal. “We in the European Union are ready for any kind of cooperation for achieving the deal,” the senior EU diplomat remarked. Borrell also called the recent agreement between Iran and the IAEA “promising” and an important step in line with the Vienna talks.
