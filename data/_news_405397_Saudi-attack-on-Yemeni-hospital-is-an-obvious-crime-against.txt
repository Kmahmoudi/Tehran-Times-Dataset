TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi condemned on Monday Saudi Arabia’s air strike on a hospital in Yemen, calling it an “obvious crime against humanity”.
 “The international community’s saddening silence over targeting the schools and hospitals has made Saudi Arabia bolder in committing inhumane crimes,” Qassemi remarked. Qassemi said, “This behavior is resulted from the deafening silence of the international community and hiding this regime’s crimes by the international bodies, especially the UN.” He added that the “war mongering” system of Saudi Arabia has no limit in killing civilians including women and children.  “It is obvious that the Yemeni representatives’ action in reopening the parliament and legal and democratic structures has made Saudis angry; so, the Saudi child killer regime seeks to take revenge from the innocent Yemeni people by vast attacks on hospitals and schools,” he explained. Saudi airstrikes on a hospital in northern Yemen that Doctors Without Borders was helping operate on Monday has left at least 11 people killed and 19 injured. Yemen’s parliament held on Saturday its first session since the outbreak of conflict in the Arab country almost two years ago.
