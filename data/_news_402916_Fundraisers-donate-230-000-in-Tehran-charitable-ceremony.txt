TEHRAN — Some 8 billion rials (nearly $230,000), both in cash and in kind, was donated during a charity fundraising ceremony in Tehran on Friday. The ceremony was arranged by Ashura Charity Foundation and the contributions are scheduled to be spent on treating refractory patients and supporting underprivileged families. The money is provided with thousands of philanthropist ranging from employees to the merchants and it would be poured into treating patients with cancer and providing dowries for those brides-to-be who cannot afford to buy things themselves, the Ashura Charity Foundation CEO told IRIB. “Compared to the last year the contributions have increased by 30 percent,” Tahmoureth Yavari said. Currently treatment expenses for 260 patients suffering from cancer are being covered by Ashura Charity Foundation and 40 brides-to-be are provided with dowry, Yavari added. Recognizing underprivileged patients, paying no interest loans to them worth of 1.2 billion rials (nearly $35,000), and donating medical equipment worth of 650 million rials (nearly $19,000) are of the most important activities of the foundation, he noted.
