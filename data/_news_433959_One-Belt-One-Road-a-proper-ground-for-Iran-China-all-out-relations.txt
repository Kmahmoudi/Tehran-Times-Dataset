TEHRAN- Iranian Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Farhad Dejpasand stressed that One Belt One Road Initiative lays the ground for the expansion of all-out relations between Iran and China. The minister made the remarks in a conference on One Belt One Road Initiative, which was held at the place of Iranian Finance and Economic Affairs Ministry on Monday, attended by a number of Iranian officials and also Chinese Ambassador to Iran Pang Sen, Shada news agency reported. While stressing the strong and strategic ties between Iran and China, Dejpasand also put emphasis on the strong will of the Iranian government for the expansion of relations with China. The two countries have previously agreed to develop a joint plan to work on China’s One Belt One Road Initiative. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as the One Belt One Road (OBOR) or the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road is a development strategy adopted by the Chinese government involving infrastructure development and investments in 152 countries and international organizations in Europe, Asia, Middle East, Latin America and Africa. "Belt" refers to the overland routes for road and rail transportation, called "the Silk Road Economic Belt"; whereas "road" refers to the sea routes, or the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.  The Chinese government calls the initiative "a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future". Some observers see it as a push for Chinese dominance in global affairs with a China-centered trading network.
