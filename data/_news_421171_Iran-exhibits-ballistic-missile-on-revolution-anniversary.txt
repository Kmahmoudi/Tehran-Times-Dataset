TEHRAN – Iran unveiled its Ghadr ballistic missile in central Tehran on Sunday, the date marking the 39th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. The Ghadr ballistic missile is capable of hitting targets at a range of 2,000 km. The showcase of the missile is considered a show of defiance by the Islamic Republic against Western pressure to curb its ballistic missile program. Tehran has repeatedly said that its missile program is solely defensive and it does not pose any threat to other countries in the region and beyond. MH/PA
