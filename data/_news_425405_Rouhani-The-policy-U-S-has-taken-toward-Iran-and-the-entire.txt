TEHRAN - President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that Iran will continue its economic relations with the rest of the world despite sanctions by the United States, assuring that the Iranian nation and government will defeat the sanctions by standing together.  Speaking after a meeting with government leaders, Rouhani said, “We are very hopeful that the trend of economic engagement with the world will continue as before.” Rouhani said the U.S. has become “more isolated” even among its allies since imposing sanctions on Iran. “Today, we are in conditions in which the United States is more isolated than ever over the sanctions issue. America’s illegal actions ... have even isolated it among its own allies as we just saw,” Rouhani said. On May 8, Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear agreement and announced restoration of sanctions against Iran. His move was only welcomed by Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly confirmed that Iran is abiding fully to the terms of the nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Rouhani says sanctions on Iran has made U.S. isolated, even among its allies Rouhani said as the U.S. failed to abort the 1979 Islamic Revolution through engineering coups, this time again it will “fail” to realize its “plot”. The president said the reason for this is that no international body backs the “unlawful” sanctions moves against Iran. “The United Nations, the Atomic Energy Agency and all countries in the world, except a few countries, are opposed to the policies, plans and words of U.S. officials,” the president remarked. The president went on to say that U.S. approach toward Iran and the entire world cannot last for long. “The path and policy of the U.S. toward Iran, the region, the Islamic world and even its allies cannot continue.” The president said Iran will counter the sanction through amity between the nation and government. “We have succeeded when the government and nation have been on the side of each other.” The president added the country will face on problems in areas of energy, transportation, basic needs and the production sector. “Today we can counter the plots of the enemies and continue our path, and the people should be confident that though there will be pressures we can leave the problems behind.” Noting the sanctions target ordinary people, Rouhani said his administration will provide the essential needs of the country.
