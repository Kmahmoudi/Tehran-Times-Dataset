TEHRAN – Iran Small Industries and Industrial Parks Organization (ISIPO) managed to revive 1,185 idle production units across the country during the past Iranian calendar year (ended on March 19), Tasnim news agency reported quoting a deputy with ISIPO. Ali-Asghar Mosaheb, ISIPO deputy head for small industries affairs, said the mentioned units returning to operation created direct jobs for 21,618 persons. The official had previously said, “Following a program for boosting domestic production, ISIPO managed to revive 529 idle production units in the first half of the past Iranian calendar year (March 21-September 21, 2019).
