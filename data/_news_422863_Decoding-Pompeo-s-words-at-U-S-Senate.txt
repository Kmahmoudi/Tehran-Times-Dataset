TEHRAN - The CIA Director "Mike Pompeo", who is nominee for Secretary of State, has recently mentioned meaningful words in his hearing at the Senate on Iran and the nuclear deal. In his words, he acknowledged that Iran was not after nuclear weapons even before the nuclear deal, nor will be in the future.  On the other hand, he has announced that he is seeking to fix and correct the nuclear deal with Iran! This is while the U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to announce his final decision on Iran's nuclear deal by May 12. “I want to fix this deal,” Pompeo said. “That’s the objective. I think that’s in the best interest of [the United States].” At his recent Senate hearing, Pompeo has emphasized that as CIA Director, he didn't find any evidences that Iran has violated the nuclear deal. At the same time, he believes that Tehran can't expand its program shortly after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear accord. He emphasized that his goal is to correct the nuclear deal with Iran. Pompeo said: “If there's no chance that we can fix it, I will recommend to the president (Trump) that we do our level best to work with our allies to achieve a better outcome and a better deal,” he said. “Even after May 12, there's still much diplomatic work to be done.” A simple decoding of Pompeo's remarks suggests that, despite the opposition to the nuclear accord, he is trying to deal differently with this issue as the future U.S. Secretary of State. Some analysts also believe that Pompeo has adopted such an approach to face the U.S. Senators' relative opposition to the White House's withdrawal from the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).  In any case, according to Pompeo, Donald Trump may not make a final decision on the nuclear deal with Iran on May 12, and he will continue to consult with his European allies on what he calls "fixing the flaws of the JCPOA". Pompeo's remarks indicate that the White House hasn't come to a determined and clear decision on how to deal with the JCPOA yet. On the other hand, numerous consultations by representatives of the four countries, the United States, France, Britain and Germany, continues in silence.  Western sources have argued that these countries are consulting on the three controversial issue, namely "the Sunset clauses", "limiting Iran's missile power" and "extensive inspections of Iran's military sites". These sources claimed that the only remaining disagreement between the four countries is over deletion of the so-called Sunset clauses from the nuclear deal, and thus putting permanent limitations on Iran's nuclear program. Pompeo is currently the CIA director, and ironically, he was one of the foremost critics of the Iran nuclear deal when he served as a House Republican from Kansas. Trump fired Secretary of State "Rex Tillerson" over the raised disagreements, and picked Pompeo as his successor in March, just two months before the deadline on May 12 to decide whether to bring back sanctions that former President of the United States waived when the JCPOA was first implemented. Before this, many Western politicians and analysts saw the nomination of Mike Pompeo for secretary of state by Trump as a sign of Washington's withdrawal from the nuclear deal. Beyond that, John Bolton's appointment as U.S. national security advisor also sent a clear message to the international system that Trump is about to pull out of the nuclear deal with Iran.  John Bolton is now silent about the fate of the JCPOA! The silence seems very meaningful at the current time. It's obvious that John Bolton is one of the main opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran, and he doesn't even believe in negotiating with the European Troika on maintaining the JCPOA.  The important question, however, is whether Bolton's silence reflects the continuing paradoxical and vague approach of the U.S. towards the JCPOA? Or did Trump ask him to be silent in this regard and wait for the final results of their talks with Europe? American senators still don't have a clear picture of Trump's final decision about the JCPOA. Meanwhile, some Republican senators like "Rand Paul" and "Jeff Flake" are worried about the costs and consequences of Trump's decision to refuse joining other members of P5+1.  Most U.S. senators tried not to mention the nuclear deal with Iran in their speeches during recent weeks. This is while some senators such as "Tom Cotton" and "Ted Cruz" strongly encourage Donald Trump's government to pull out of the nuclear deal with Iran.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
