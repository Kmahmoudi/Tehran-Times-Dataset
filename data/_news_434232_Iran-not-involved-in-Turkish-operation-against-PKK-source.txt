TEHRAN – An informed source with the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces has said Iran is not involved in the Turkish military’s operation against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). According to Mehr, the source made the comments after reports emerged that Iran is cooperating with Turkey in the operation. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Turkey and Iran carried out a joint operation against militants from the outlawed PKK on Monday. “We started carrying out an operation with Iran against the PKK on our eastern border this morning,” Soylu said.
