TEHRAN – “The Sacrifice”, a novel by the New York Times bestselling author Joyce Carol Oates, has been published in Persian.

 Ali Qane’ is the translator of the book, which was published by the Chatrang Publications in Tehran. The book tells the story of a fourteen-year-old girl, who is the alleged victim of a terrible act of racial violence. “This novel is one of the last works by the author and was published in 2015 with a complicated story.  The analysis of the major and minor events in the story reveals the inner side of the characters,” Qane’ told the Persian service of MNA on Monday. 
    
“The author never tries to judge the characters and the events but only portrays the ugly and beautiful images and events,” he added. “At the end of the story, the reader faces many victims trapped in a repetitious circle that never ends,” he added.  In this magisterial work of fiction, Joyce Carol Oates explores the uneasy fault lines in a racially troubled society, where she reveals that there must always be a sacrifice of innocence, truth, trust and, ultimately, of lives.  RM/YAW
