TEHRAN – Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Tuesday that talks are underway for purchase of 950 tons of yellow cake from Kazakhstan. “Consultations for purchase of 950 tons of yellow cake from Kazakhstan are not yet over and will continue,” Araqchi said ahead of the seventh meeting of the Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which started in Vienna on Tuesday. He also pointed to the U.S. failure to fully commit to the nuclear accord. According to Araqchi all cases regarding the issue were to be raised during the joint commission on Tuesday. Araqchi, who on the part of Iran is tasked to monitor the implementation of the 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and six world powers, noted that Washington’s policy of reevaluating the JCPOA is creating an atmosphere of distrust and confusion among world countries, and this is contrary to the text and spirit of the agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump has recently claimed that Iran has not lived up to “the spirit” of the nuclear agreement. This is while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier confirmed Iran was compliant with its commitments under the deal. MH/PA
