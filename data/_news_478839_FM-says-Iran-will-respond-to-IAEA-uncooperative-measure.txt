TEHRAN- Hossein Amir Abdollahian, the Foreign Minister of Iran, on Saturday described as "unconstructive" a recent resolution against Tehran by the IAEA Board of Governors, threatening that Iran will retaliate by taking “political measures”. Amir Abdollahian made the statement during a joint press conference with his Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr Albusaidi after two rounds of negotiations in Tehran. The Iranian minister asserted that the International Atomic Energy Agency took a negative stance on Thursday, despite the fact that an Iranian delegation made up of representatives from the foreign ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) had visited Vienna two weeks earlier and talked with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi about ways to strengthen cooperation between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog. However, he condemned the IAEA board for once again misusing its authority to approve a resolution under pressure from the United States and European allies. The resolution was drafted by the U.S. and three European countries of Britain, France and Germany. Amir Abdollahian said, “We will follow through on our promises to uphold international law and obligations and take reciprocal action.” He also drew attention to the presence of foreign troops in the region and noted that security issues in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea region have been brought on by the movement of unmanned vessels from ultra-regional states. The senior Iranian diplomat indicated that the parties talked about a variety of topics of shared interest as well as the implementation of recent agreements between Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Sultan Haitham bin Tarik of Oman. “We are glad to see that the agreements and wishes of both heads of state will emerge in all facets of reciprocal economic and commercial cooperation,” the minister said.  Iran appreciates Oman's proactive efforts to help the Islamic Republic lift harsh sanctions as well as Muscat's support for reaching a final agreement in the nuclear negotiations, he said. He added regional countries can maintain stability and security in the West Asia region. The Omani foreign minister, for his part, emphasized that the Arab country maintains a good neighbor approach in dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Albusaidi said Oman has long attempted to safeguard maritime and trade security for the benefit of the region's nations. There are several obstacles and disagreements, but the best way to address them is via dialogue and diplomatic means, he emphasized. Albusaidi said that Muscat denounce all forms of terrorism and violence, emphasizing the need for constructive relations with the Islamic Republic.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
