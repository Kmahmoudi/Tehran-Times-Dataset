TEHRAN - Thousands of people from all layers of society on Monday said goodbye to an 8-year-old pupil, Ali Asghar Lorigoyini, who was martyred in the Shiraz terrorist incident on October 26. In addition to Ali Asghar, two other schoolchildren were martyred in the attack on the Shah-e Cheragh shrine in Shiraz, the capital of Far province.  The immaculate body of Ali Asghar was laid to rest on Monday morning while the brave people of Kerman, including the families of the martyrs, pupils and local officials, gathered to decry the nefarious act of terror which was claimed by the Daesh terrorist group. Lorigoyini was buried in the city of Kerman, known as “the capital of Islamic resistance”. (Kerman has got this title as the birthplace of Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, the anti-terror hero who was assassinated by the U.S. in Iraq in January 2020.)  While biding their final and sorrowful farewell to the youngest martyr of the terrorist attack, the enthusiastic people called for bringing the perpetrators to justice. Before the evening prayers on October 26, a heavily-armed terrorist attacked the well-known shrine, killing 15 pilgrims, including a woman, and wounded at least 30 others. According to the provincial police chief, the gunman started mowing down at everyone within the shrine. Security personnel injured the offender and then arrested him. Later, he perished from his wounds. Six of the victims, who were the natives of Fars province, were buried in the courtyard of the Shah-e Cheragh shrine on Sunday. Large number of people from different cities, including neighboring provinces, poured into Shiraz to pay tribute to them. A huge funeral procession was also held in Shiraz on Saturday. It was attended by top IRGC and Army commanders as well as political officials. IRGC chief Major General Hossein Salami addressed the mourners.
