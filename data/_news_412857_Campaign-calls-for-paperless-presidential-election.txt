TEHRAN — A recently launched public-spearheaded campaign aiming to help preserve the environment has demanded presidential candidates not to use paper posters during the election process. Conventionally the candidates use posters in an attempt to influence the public, however this year people have urged the candidates to use social media to receive publicity in order to respect the environment. “As currently efforts to save and protect the environment is a priority and a genuine concern for the public one of the criteria for choosing a president is how socially responsible they are for the environment and that’s why the public are calling for a poster-free election,” the campaign says, adding, “Regardless of the posters people have other standards for choosing the best person who fits for the position.” Iran’s presidential election is due to be held on May 19, 2017.
