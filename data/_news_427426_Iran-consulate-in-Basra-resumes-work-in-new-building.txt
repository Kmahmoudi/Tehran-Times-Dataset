TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Tuesday that the Iranian consulate in Basra has resumed its work in a new building after the old building was set ablaze in a raid. “After a bitter attack on the Iranian consulate in Basra, which was condemned by many Iraqi political and non-political figures, the Iranian diplomats immediately settled in a new, suitable building and started their activities,” Qassemi said. In the Friday attack, a mob of Iraqi protestors stormed the Iranian consulate in Basra, destroyed the diplomatic mission’s properties, took down the flag of Iran and torched the building.
