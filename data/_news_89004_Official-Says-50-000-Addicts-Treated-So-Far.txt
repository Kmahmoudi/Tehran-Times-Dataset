Speaking in a ceremony to inaugurate a Therapeutic Community (TC) where the addicts and drug abusers could refer for treatment and medical health services, Rahchamani said the government cannot solve the problem of addiction on its own. He called for the public and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to participate in the anti-drug efforts, IRNA reported. He went on to say that some 90 governmental institutions and some 100 non-governmental agencies would operate this year to cure the addicts. Some 150,000-drug addicts are expected to be treated and recover their health this year, he said adding there are now some 12 drug addicts rehabilitation centers nationwide. He said however 98 percent of those receiving treatment services in the rehab centers have relapsed into the drug usage. He said the TCS are a modern approach to the drug abuse problem and added that there are now 10 TCS in the country. There are 2.5 million drug addicts in the country, said the official and reiterated that some 50 percent of drug addicts are illiterate. He noted that some 20,000 people are believed to contaminate the HIV out of which 66 percent have gotten the disease through drug injection. Rahchamani said many social problems are linked to the drug abuse, which gives rise to the social vulnerability of those falling prey to addiction. Some 25 social problems have been identified in connection with the illicit drug abuse, he noted and stated that a wide range of offenses such as prostitution, theft, homicide, suicide, acts of violence as well as domestic violence are related to the drug  abuse. He pointed out that officials and organizations involved in the fight against the illicit drugs have to get mobilized in measurers to eradicate the drug problem from the society and mop up the areas infested with drugs, drug users and dealers. Reportedly, the increasing abuse of illicit drugs have created complicated problems in particular the overcrowding of the prisons. Abusing illicit drugs through injection is considered a major factor responsible for the AIDS infection in Iran. Cultural approach should be considered as a complementary approach and replace the physical one to deal with the drug problem, he said and commented on the available facilities and services for the drug addicts to undergo treatment. Rahchamani called on officials to adopt substantial measures and policies to tackle the growing problem of the illicit drug abuse in Iran due to the fact that the number of the drug addicts are increasing. He went on to say that public awareness can be a good approach to hamper the spread of the drug usage among people, and in particular, among young individuals.
