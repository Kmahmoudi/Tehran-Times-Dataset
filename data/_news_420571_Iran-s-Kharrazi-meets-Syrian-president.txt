TEHRAN – Former Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who is the current chairman of Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, on Sunday held talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad to discuss regional issues. Kharrazi arrived in Syria on Wednesday for holing talks with top Syrian political and religious figures. In his meeting with the Syrian president, Kharrazi said the Syrian government’s recent victories were achieved through the bravery of the Syrian armed forces with a backing by allies. He called for more efforts so that all Syrian territories be cleared of the terrorists. “The enemies of Syria and the resistance front will not cease to hatch plots, so [we] need to be aware of the enemies’ plots,” he was quoted by Pars Today as saying. Assad, for his part, thanked the Islamic Republic’s support for the Syrian nation and said the resistance of the Iranian forces and other allies in the war fronts played an important role in the victories of the Syrian army and nation. Kharrazi and President Assad last met two years ago. Prior to the on-going visit to Damascus, Kharrazi traveled to Lebanon and conferred with several Lebanese political and religious officials.
