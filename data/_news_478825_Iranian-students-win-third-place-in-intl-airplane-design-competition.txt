TEHRAN – The students of Sharif University of Technology Aerospace Faculty won third place in the RAeS International Light Aircraft Design Competition 2022-23. The sixth edition of RAeS design competitions aimed at promoting innovation in the general aviation aircraft sector.  This year's competition was supported by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA) and the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA), both of which supervise the building and operation of most of the light aircraft in the UK. The Iranian team ranked third among 50 participating teams with the design of the LyreBird aircraft.To help combat the adversities faced by countries without immediate access to food and medical supplies, students were tasked with designing an electric aircraft capable of delivering a payload of 100kg, tested and implemented on the X-Plane 11 flight simulator. The Iranian team, consisting of undergraduate students of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, managed to take third place in this competition out of 50 participating teams with the design of the LyreBird aircraft.
