TEHRAN – The police have confiscated 285kg of opium in  central province of Semnan, a provincial police chief has announced. Abdollah Hassani said on Monday the police forces seized the illicit drugs which were destined for Semnan province from Sistan-Baluchestan province, Mehr reported. During the operation one smuggler was arrested, Hassani added. Iran, which has a 900-kilometer-long border with Afghanistan, has been used as the main conduit for smuggling Afghan drugs to narcotics kingpins in Europe.
