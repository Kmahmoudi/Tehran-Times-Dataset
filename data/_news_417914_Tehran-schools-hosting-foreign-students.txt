TEHRAN - Some 370,000 foreign students, mostly Afghan nationals, receive free of charge schooling in Iran for the current school year, starting September 23, 2017. The pictures depict students in an elementary school and a high school in Tehran, where foreign students study together with Iranian nationals.   Iran is trying to create an equal educational opportunity for all Afghan nationals similar to Iranians regardless of their immigration status for some years now.  According to a decree issued by the supreme leader, all foreign nationals, even those who have no identification and are living in Iran illegally, can go to schools in the country.        Paving the way for foreign nationals’ education in the country is of major cultural and political importance, Education Minister Mohammad Bat’haei has said. 
“Those foreign students who have studied in our country can later play a key role in cultural diffusion by spreading Iranian cultural beliefs in other countries.”  Despite limited international funds Iran is seriously striving to give free of charge schooling to all foreign nationals living in the country.
