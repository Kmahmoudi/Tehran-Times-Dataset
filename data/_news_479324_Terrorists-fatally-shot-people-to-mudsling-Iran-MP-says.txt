TEHRAN- The head of the Iranian Parliament's foreign relations subcommittee has said that terrorists “supported” by the West used weapons to shoot at security personnel and civilians in an effort to link the Iranian government to the deaths, IRNA reported on Friday. To protect civilians, Golroo said, the unarmed security forces made sacrifices by being engaged in battle with thugs and terrorists who "opened fire on citizens and military and police personnel to incriminate the government in people's deaths." Abbas Golroo also reacted angrily to a resolution adopted the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on November 24 to launch an independent, international fact-finding mission to thoroughly and independently investigate alleged human rights violations in Iran related to the protests that began on September 16. On November 18, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors also voted in favor of resolution against Iran.  “However,” he added, “the resolutions which were recently discussed in the UN Human Rights Council and the IAEA Board of Governors were totally political and were ratified against the Islamic Republic of Iran according to plans devised by the U.S. and the West and supported by their allies,” he noted, adding, “International institutions are set up to address issues facing countries in accordance with international law and without any political bias.” Golroo pointed out that the “antagonistic” views of those nations at the UNHRC that voted in support of the resolution are apparent. The lawmaker added, "We believe this to be a hostile approach far from reality, and we will have no collaboration with such a committee." He said that the U.S., the Zionist regime, and Western powers "hatched all such ploys." In spite of the fact that such "false flag" killings have been carried out by terrorist organizations, the resolution made reference to purported violence against civilians, particularly children and women, the MP remarked. Alluding to terrorist incidents in Fars and Khuzestan provinces, he said, "If the fact-finding committee is genuinely impartial and wants the truth, it should look into the terrorist strikes in Shah Cheragh and Izeh." Before the evening prayers on October 26, a terrorist with links to Daesh assaulted the Shah Cheragh shrine in the southern province of Fars, killing at least 15 pilgrims, among them a woman and two children, and wounded another 40. Also, around dusk on November 17, terrorists opened fire at citizens and security personnel at a packed market in Izeh, Khuzestan province. At least seven individuals were murdered. Golroo highlighted that women and children account for the majority of the victims of these assaults, and "all clues of these terrorist actions can be linked back to states that pushed for the creation of a fact-finding mission." In other parts of his remarks, Golroo said that the nations who pushed for the fact-finding mission are also the ones who perpetrate such crimes. “Why didn’t they establish such a committee on crimes of the U.S., Britain, Germany, and other supporters of such resolutions that have carried out crimes in Syria, Yemen, the Iran-Iraq war and other countries? Or on the killing of half a million women and children in Syria and Iraq by Daesh who acted as agents of Europe, America, and the Zionist regime?”  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
