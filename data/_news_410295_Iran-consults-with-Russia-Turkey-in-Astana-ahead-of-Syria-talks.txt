Iran and Russia have been backing the central government during the six years of conflict in Syria. However, Turkey has been siding with armed opposition groups seeking to ouster the Beshar al-Assad government. Turkey changed the tact as the Syrian forces, backed by the Russian air force, succeeded to recapture the strategic city of Aleppo.   Russia has also invited the new U.S. government to join the Syria talks. However, Iran has openly opposed the U.S. involvement in the talks, saying it will derail the peace process. UN will attend Syria talks The UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura will also head the UN delegation to the Astana talks. "In light of the complexity and importance of the issues likely to be raised in Astana, and of the senior level at which the conveners of the meeting will be represented, the secretary-general has asked Mr. de Mistura, to lead the UN team at the talks," Stphane Dujarric, the spokesman for UN secretary general, said in a statement on Thursday.
