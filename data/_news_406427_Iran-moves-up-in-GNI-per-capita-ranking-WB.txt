TEHRAN – Iran has advanced in the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita ranking in 2015, according to a report released by the World Bank in July 2016. The Islamic Republic’s rank moved a place up despite the 46 percent decrease in global oil prices in 2015, Fars news agency reported on Thursday.
Iran, with $17,400 of per capita income per year, ranked 90th among the 216 countries on the list and stood among the countries with upper-middle-income.
The countries included in GNI per capita report are categorized in four groups namely the high-income group, the upper-middle-income group, the lower-middle-income group, and the low-income one.
The GNI per capita is the dollar value of a country’s final income in a year, divided by its population. It reflects the average income of a country’s citizens.
Knowing a country’s GNI per capita is a good first step toward understanding the country’s economic strengths and needs, as well as the general standard of living enjoyed by the average citizen. A country’s GNI per capita tends to be closely linked with other indicators that measure the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the country and its people. For example, generally people living in countries with higher GNI per capita tend to have longer life expectancies, higher literacy rates, better access to safe water, and lower infant mortality rates.
