MOSCOW – Russia started the 2018 FIFA World Cup on a high note, thrashing Saudi Arabia 5-0 on Thursday.   In match held in front of an 80,000-capacity Luzhniki crowd which included President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi crown prince, Yury Gazinsky opened the scoring with a header. Denis Cheryshev showed great skill of his own to double the hosts' lead just before half time with a left-footed shot, and Artem Dzyuba headed Russia's third in the 71st minute — 89 seconds after coming on as a substitute. Cheryshev and Golovin hit a further two in injury time, the latter from a free kick, to complete the visitors' misery. Egypt and Uruguay are due to play the second Group A match in Yekaterinburg on Friday. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
