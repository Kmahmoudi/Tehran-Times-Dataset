TEHRAN â€“ Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani said on Monday that he had asked Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to appoint the new head for the Judiciary sooner than expected. Amoli Larijani said his successor will be named in the coming days, ISNA reported. He said he made the request due to his heavy responsibilities in the Expediency Council and the Guardian Council. The Leader appointed Ayatollah Amoli Larijani as the head of the Judiciary in August 2009, replacing Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi. Under law, Judiciary chief is appointed by the Leader for a period of 5 years, which is extendable. According to unofficial reports, Ebrahim Raisi, the current custodian of the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, will replace Amoli Larijani.
