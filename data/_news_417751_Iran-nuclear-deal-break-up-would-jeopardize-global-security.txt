Ending the Iran nuclear deal would jeopardize global security, including the situation on the Korean peninsula, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. Lavrov said it is not possible to return to the situation which pertained before the nuclear deal, also called the JCPOA, was ratified, RT reported on Friday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) “performs regular checks and confirms their [Iran’s] strict fulfillment of obligations,” the foreign minister stated. “Restoring the UN Security Council sanctions [on Iran] is out of the question,” Lavrov stressed. The Russian minister said any changes to the Iran deal would require the approval of all member states, including Iran. “Restoring the UN Security Council sanctions [on Iran] is out of the question,” Foreign Minister Lavrov stresses. “Any attempts to start such talks [to break up the Iran nuclear deal] may bury this important agreement in the sphere of strategic stability and nuclear non-proliferation,” he said. The JCPOA has once again been in the spotlight since U.S. President Donald Trump decided last week not to certify the deal. Ever since, top world leaders have voiced their strong support for the full implementation of the deal.  Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to the deal as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal to pieces if Washington pulled out.
