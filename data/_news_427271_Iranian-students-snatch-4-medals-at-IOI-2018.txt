The primary goal of the IOI is to stimulate interest in informatics (computing science) and information technology. Another important goal is to bring together exceptionally talented pupils from various countries and to have them share scientific and cultural experiences. The event is organized annually in and by one of the participating countries. Each participating country typically sends a delegation of four contestants and two accompanying adults.
