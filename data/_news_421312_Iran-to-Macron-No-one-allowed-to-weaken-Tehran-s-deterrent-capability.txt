TEHRAN – In response to the French president’s remarks against Tehran’s missile program, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Thursday saying the “peace-seeking” Iran will not let any attempt to weaken its “deterrent” defense capabilities.
 On Tuesday, French President Emanuel Macron said that the international community needs “to put Iran under surveillance over its ballistic missiles”. According to Sputnik, Macron also said, “And [We need] to put Iran under surveillance over its ballistic missiles. It’s necessary for the regional security and so we need a mechanism of sanctions and control adapted to that.”  The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, “The French president’s remarks are based on a kind of prejudice and unrealistic view on regional developments. Such approach is not of any help to the situation.” Iran has “logical” and “realistic” view and expects the European countries to take steps on the path of “convergence” and “independence” and also take more “precise steps” in line with the international peace and security through adopting “realistic” approaches towards international developments, Qassemi remarked. He noted that Iran’s missile capabilities are within the framework of the country’s military doctrine which is based on “deterrent and defensive policies”. Qassemi added, “The real danger is the U.S. and some European countries’ rivalry in selling sophisticated and advanced weapons to certain countries in the region which is a provocative and destabilizing action.”  “Those who are concerned about Iran’s defense and deterrent capabilities must review the history of the eight-year imposed war on Iran and their illogical actions against the great Iranian people,” the Foreign Ministry says.
Qassemi said, “Those who are concerned about Iran’s defense and deterrent capabilities must review the history of the eight-year imposed war on Iran and their illogical actions against the great Iranian people and immediately stop sending mass destruction weapons to the regional countries.” The Foreign Ministry official warned that providing supports for terrorism, selling weapons and interfering are actual threats against the region. He also said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran has initiated plans to provide security and stability in the region with participation of the Persian Gulf littoral states and cooperation among the regional countries. Fake concerns of the extra-regional countries about Iran’s defense capabilities are unacceptable.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
