Iranian taekwondo player Kimia Alizadeh says that she is going to enjoy the sport, instead of worrying about the winning medal.  Alizadeh became the first Iranian woman to win an Olympic medal, taking bronze in a taekwondo event. The 18-year-old defeated Sweden’s Nikita Glasnovic 5 - 1. She had already won a bronze medal at the 22nd WTF World Taekwondo Championships 2015 in Chelyabinsk, Russia. Alizadeh underwent surgery on her left ankle and is recovering at the moment. She is preparing for the 23rd WTF World Taekwondo Championships which will be held in Muju, South Korea from June 22 to 30. “I won a bronze medal in the previous edition and I am going to do my best this time. From now on, I just want to concentrate on my performance,” Alizadeh said. “Iranian people expect me to win gold medal but I believe that the results are in God’s hands and I’ll just try my best,” she added. “I will win what I deserve. I will train hard and never give up,” Alizadeh stated. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
