TEHRAN – Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations said on Friday that Donald Trump’s recognition of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel amounts to legitimizing occupation, IRNA reported.
 Addressing a UN General Assembly meeting on “culture of peace”, Gholamali Khoshroo said endeavors to deny indisputable rights of the Palestinian people will further worsen the situation in the occupied territories.
The move, he opined, exposes United States’ hypocritical policies regarding peace and stability in the Middle East and its disregard for international law and Palestinians’ legitimate rights.

The ambassador went on to say that that the international community, the U.S. and the Zionist regime are responsible for dangerous consequences of such an “irresponsible and illegal” move.
