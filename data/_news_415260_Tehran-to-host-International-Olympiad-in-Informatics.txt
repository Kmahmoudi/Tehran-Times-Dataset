TEHRAN — Tehran will play host to the 29th International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI 2017) from July 28 to August 4. The IOI is an annual international competition for high school students from various invited countries, accompanied by social and cultural programmers. This year some 300 students from 85 countries from around the world will participate in the event.   According to the IOI official website, the original idea of initiating the IOI was proposed to the 24th general conference of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) by the Bulgarian delegate Professor Sendov in October 1987. This plan was included into the fifth main program of UNESCO for the biennium 1988–1989. In May 1989, UNESCO initiated and sponsored the first IOI, which was held in Pravetz, Bulgaria. Each participating country is represented by a team of up to four contestants. The competition will take place during two competition days both of which are directly preceded and followed by a non-competition day. During the competition each contestant must work independently on a desk with an appropriate computer, access to the competition procedures (translated if required), writing instrument and paper. According to the IOI regulations, the main objectives to be accomplished by the IOI include discovering, encouraging, bringing together, challenging, and giving recognition to young people who are exceptionally talented in the field of informatics. It additionally aims at fostering friendly international relationships among computer scientists and informatics educators, bringing the discipline of informatics to the attention of young people, and promoting the organization of informatics competitions for students at schools for secondary education.
