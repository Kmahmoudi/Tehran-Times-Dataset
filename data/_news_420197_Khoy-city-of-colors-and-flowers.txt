The northwestern Iranian city is also filled with centuries-old mosques, churches, caravanserais, bathhouses, fortresses, and ramparts, each telling their own tales. Khoy may not be on every traveler’s radar, but it is a natural fit for eco-tourists as it offers loads of scenic hikes, panoramic views besides colorful geological features. Therapeutic warm-water spas, salt mines and Christian centers are among its other charms.
