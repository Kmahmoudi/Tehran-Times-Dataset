TEHRAN – Iranian embassy in Austria issued a statement on Monday saying it is striving to resolve the problems Iranian citizens face after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning immigrants and citizens of Iran and six other countries from entering the United States, IRNA reported. Three Iranian citizens, expecting to catch connecting flights to the U.S. to visit family members, were stuck in transit at Vienna airport due to the travel ban. They canceled their trip after three days. The embassy said it will do its responsibilities as to offer consular services to Iranian citizens. As Tehran and Washington do not have diplomatic relations, Austria has been acting as the go-between for travelers and immigrants. Thomas Schnoell, Austrian foreign ministry spokesman, said as a result of the suspension, around 300 people in Iran who had been told they would receive Austrian visas have been told that they cannot now travel. Trump’s move has also sparked mass protests at airports across the United States, with thousands of people denouncing the ban as xenophobic. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has said that Iran will take reciprocal measures. Also, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Tuesday that the ministry has issued an important order to Iranian embassies across the world in regard to the travel ban. Qassemi added Iran will take appropriate measures in response to the ban. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
