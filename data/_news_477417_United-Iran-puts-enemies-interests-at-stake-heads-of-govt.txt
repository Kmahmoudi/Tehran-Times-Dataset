TEHRAN- The heads of the three branches of the Iranian government have stressed that foes of the Islamic Republic think that a strong and united Iran has potentials to pose threats to their interests.  In the midst of ongoing unrest in certain towns following the death of a young Iranian lady at a police station in mid-September, President Ebrahim Raisi, Judiciary Chief Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, and Speaker of the Parliament Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf met on Saturday. They emphasized the need to bolster national cohesion for the advancement and development of the nation and praised the Iranian people for their wisdom in helping to thwart opponents' hostile machinations during the past three weeks. They said in order to combat hostility and attempts to sow division in the Iranian society, the Islamic Republic today requires unity among people from all walks of life regardless of language, religion, and nationality. They added that all Iranian entities must also make efforts in this direction. According to the chiefs of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, sustaining national peace is crucial for citizens' economic and commercial activity. They went on to add, “The security and peace in the country forms the foundation of any kind of development and people's economic activities and businesses.” Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman who fainted at a police station in Tehran on September 13 and was declared dead on September 16 in hospital, sparked protests first in her home province of Kurdistan and then spread to many other cities, including the country's capital Tehran. The protests quickly descended into bloody riots, with protestors rampaging around the country, assaulting security personnel, damaging public property, and defiling holy sites. President Raisi commissioned a comprehensive inquiry into the incident as soon as Amini passed away. On September 30, the Iranian Intelligence Ministry stated that Western governments and their mercenary media incited the rioters, spread false information and distorted the sequence of events that followed Amini's death even before the official investigation into the incident was complete. Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, strongly condemned the riots in a speech to military cadets last Monday, asserting that the United States and the Israeli regime had planned them in advance. “I clearly say that these riots and insecurities were engineered by the U.S., the usurping and fake Zionist regime, their paid agents, and certain treasonous Iranians abroad supported them,” the Leader said. Ayatollah Khamenei said the main problems of Israel and the U.S. are a “strong,” “independent” and “advanced” Iran. He added the Iranian nation reacted “quite powerfully” and “bravely” toward these plots and they will do so whenever necessary. Ayatollah Khamenei also reacted to the death of Amini, saying, “The death of the young girl also broke our heart.”  Amini had been arrested by morality police to receive training on Islamic dress code.  The Forensic Medicine on Friday released the impatiently awaited report about the death of Amini in which it said she suffered no damage to her head and other vital organs. Based on the medical documents, a CT scan of her brain and lungs, examination of the corpse, pathology and necropsy, it was revealed that Amini’s death was not related to a blow to head or other vital organs, the Forensic Medicine explained.
