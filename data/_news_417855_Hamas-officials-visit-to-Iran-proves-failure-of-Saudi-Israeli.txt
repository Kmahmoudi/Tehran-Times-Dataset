TEHRAN - Kamal Kharrazi, director of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, said on Monday that presence of Hamas officials in Iran proves that the policies adopted by Saudis Arabia and the Zionist regime of Israel have ended in failure.
 After his meeting with Saleh al-Arouri, deputy chief of Hamas political bureau, Kharrazi expressed hope that Hamas would continue resistance against the occupation of the Palestinian lands by Israel. He also called the fantasy of Shia Crescent a “wrong theory”, because Iran has always supported Sunni Palestinians, including the Hamas resistance group, against Israel. “Today, we support Hamas against the Zionist regime,” he added. Some radical politicians in the Arab world have claimed that Shiite Iran is seeking to create a bloc of Shia communities in the region. Arouri told reporters that the Hamas delegation’s presence in Tehran and its consultations with the Islamic Republic’s officials are aimed to strengthen cooperation and friendly relations. He also said that the issue of national reconciliation among the Palestinian groups was discussed in the meeting with Iranian officials and Iranians supported the national reconciliation. The high-ranking Hamas delegation began a visit to Iran on Friday to inform Tehran about reconciliation efforts with rival Palestinian faction Fatah, according to Fars news agency. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri has said that Hamas delegation’s visit to Tehran was in line with supporting the resistance and political consultations on political issues related to Palestine and other regional developments.
