TEHRAN – Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has expressed regret over the U.S. pullout from the Iran nuclear deal, saying that “in the upcoming weeks, we, Europeans, will do anything in our power to save the nuclear deal as long as Iran is in compliance with it.” “U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement is very regrettable,” Fars quoted Kurz as saying in an interview with Die Welt on Sunday. Earlier this month, Trump officially withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA.
