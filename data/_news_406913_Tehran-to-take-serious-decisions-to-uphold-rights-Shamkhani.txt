TEHRAN – The Supreme National Security Council secretary said on Thursday that Iran will take more serious decisions to uphold its rights if the U.S. violates its commitments under the JCPOA, the official for the nuclear pact.
 “If we are supposed to witness stonewalling by the U.S. for small jobs like buying airliner, we will take more serious decisions to uphold our rights,” Ali Shamkhani said in a ceremony hosted by the Energy Ministry in Tehran. He condemned the U.S. for its delay in implementing its obligations on the basis of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “It has been proven to us by various experiences in the nuclear talks and regional developments that trust on the U.S., be it in Syrian truce or removal of economic sanctions, is example of moving towards mirage,” the top security official remarked. Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany - finalized the text of the JCPOA in Vienna in July 2015. The deal took effect in January 2016.
