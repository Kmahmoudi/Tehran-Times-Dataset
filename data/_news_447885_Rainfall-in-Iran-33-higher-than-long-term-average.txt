The global average annual precipitation is more than 990 mm, based on which Iran Is classified as an arid and semi-arid country. Almost all provinces hit long-run means Gilan, Mazandaran, and Lorestan provinces surpassed other provinces in terms of high rainfall rates over the aforesaid period, as the rainiest provinces, Gilan, Mazandaran, and Lorestan provinces got 811.7, 663.7 and 581.9 mm of rain, respectively.

Almost all the provinces experienced increased rainfall compared to the long term average, except for Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari, Kohgiluyeh-Boyerahmad, and Kermanshah. Yazd, South Khorasan, and Semnan provinces recorded the lowest rainfall among the whole provinces. During the aforementioned period, 343.6 mm of rain doused Tehran, which shows a 23.5 and 9.1 percent increase compared to both the long run and last year, respectively. Is increased rainfall always a good sign? Fluctuation in precipitations amounts received in some provinces at the beginning of the crop year is one of the main signs of climate change in the country which not only results in an increase in water resources but it would lead to recurrent destructive floods in the regions. Some provinces that have been struggling with low rainfall faced above normal rainfall during the same period last year or in the long run, while some others that have always been meeting above-normal averages are facing shortages.  Climate disruption or global climate disruption, is the new term scientists are using to explain the extreme fluctuations that can and will occur to our weather systems as anthropogenic-caused carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases increase in our atmosphere, the oceans get warmer, and weather events go wild. The report regrets that climate disruption will be continuing as climate change is on the rise and it calls on taking proper and effective measures to alleviate the adverse effects of climate change on the country.
