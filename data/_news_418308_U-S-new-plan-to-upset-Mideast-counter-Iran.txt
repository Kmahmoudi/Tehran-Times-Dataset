A geopolitical researcher Anthony Cartalucci believe the U.S. coordinately with Saudi Arabia and the Zionist regime will attempt to leverage Hariri’s resignation to roll back Iranian influence in the region. Lebanese Prime Minister Sadd Hariri’s surprise resignation while visiting Saudi Arabia instead of his own country raises many questions about the new phase of the regional tensions and instabilities planned by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and the Zionist regime. All these happens at a time when the Islamic Republic of Iran and its allies are widely seen to have won the war against the terrorist groups backed by Washington and its regional allies in Syria and Iraq.
To shed more light on the issue, an interview is done with Bangkok- based geopolitical researcher Anthony Cartalucci.
Here is the text of the interview: Q: What does Lebanese PM Saad Hariri’s surprise resignation in Saudi Arabia indicate? What relation may exist between his announcement and Saudi Arabia’s objectives? A: This appears to be part of preparations being made by the United States and its regional allies to shift the Middle East conflict into a new phase. The full extent of damage the U.S. can exact on Syria has been reached, and from this point forward, Syria will begin a recovery process that will eventually see it and its forces strengthen. U.S. policymakers have already made it abundantly clear that they seek to shift the focus on Iran and as a link to direct confrontation with Tehran, they are planning on targeting Hezbollah - in Lebanon particularly.  Hariri leaving ahead of what is likely to be a repeat of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War will give the U.S. and Israel more leeway to devastate Lebanon and pin all the blame on Hezbollah and Iran. With Lebanon and Syria both devastated from war, the West will be able to focus more directly on Iran itself.  While some have interpreted Saudi Arabia's recent moves as "reform," simply looking at Saudi Arabia's continued support for terrorist organizations across the region and around the world, as well as its continuing brutality against neighboring Yemen indicate that is it likely consolidating its position further ahead of more aggression, confrontation, and conflict.   Q: Will his resignation lead to more instability and tensions in Lebanon and in the region, especially now that we are approaching the end of ISIL and other terrorist groups in some of the regional countries? A: Hariri's resignation will not cause instability in and of itself. It will be used as a pretext to attempt to artificially create it. Indeed, the waning existence of Washington's militant proxies, including ISIL in Syria and Iraq is precipitating this next phase in an attempt to move conflict with Iran (and Russia) forward.  Q: What connection do you describe between the plots of White House, Riyadh and Zionist regime against the region and Saad Hariri’s resignation? A: The United States uses both Saudi Arabia and Israel as its proxies in the region. This is why Tel Aviv and Riyadh superficially appear ideologically opposed to one another, yet geopolitically, they act in absolute concert with one another and ultimately with US objectives in the region. Hariri fleeing to Saudi Arabia is Riyadh's part of the plot. Israel instigating war with Hezbollah and greater Lebanon will be Tel Aviv's part. The U.S. will attempt to leverage both events to advance toward its ultimate goal, rolling back Iranian influence in the region, and if possible, toppling Tehran's political order.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
