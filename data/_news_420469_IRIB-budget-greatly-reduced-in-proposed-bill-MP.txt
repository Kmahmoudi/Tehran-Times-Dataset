TEHRAN – Ehsan Qazizadeh Hashemi, a member of the Majlis Cultural Committee, says under the proposed national budget bill, the government has reduced the budget for the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) by more than 9 trillion rials (nearly $200 million). Warning of the consequences of the budget cut, Qazizadeh Hashemi said according to the sixth development plan, 0.7% of the annual budget should be allocated for the IRIB, adding that the Rouhani administration’s budget bill fails to meet that plan. He called on the administration to immediately find a solution for the issue as it could cause complications, Mehr reported on Friday.
