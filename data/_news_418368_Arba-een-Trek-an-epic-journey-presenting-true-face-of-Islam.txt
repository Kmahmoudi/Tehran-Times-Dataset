TEHRAN — Millions partaking in Arba’een Trek, commemorating the 40th day of Imam Hussein (AS) martyrdom in the battle of Karbala, presents the true face of Islam which is peace and brotherhood.  Arba’een Trek, a distinctively Shia spiritual exercise, is an epic journey gathering Shias as well as Sunnis, even Christians, Yazidis, Zoroastrians, Sabians, etc. from various nationalities altogether walking towards the same goal, the holey shrine of Imam Hussein (AS).  Arba’een Trek symbolizes a classless utopian society, where everyone competes to be a better person and to make more sacrifices regardless of their individual motivations. A society which is in sharp contrast with Individualistic western culture stressing the needs of the individual over the needs of the group as a whole.  Not unlike other religions, Islam is a religion which forbids violence and preach peace among its followers. Despite the negative image of Islam associated with war and violence Arba’een Trek is a definitive evidence of the fact that Islam is nothing but a peaceful religion convening men, women, and children of various beliefs together in perfect safety.   The battle of Karbala and Imam Hussein’s stand against the tyrant Khalifa Yazid was a selfless effort to safeguard and help the oppressed and the symbol of being a true servant of God.  In a similar manner, people participating in the Arba’een pilgrimage are trying to practice be a faithful servant of God by giving and sharing regardless of their own gain.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
