TEHRAN- Moldova's President Igor Dodon and Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) Chairman Gholam-Hossein Shafeie explored avenues of broadening trade bonds in Tehran on Monday. During the meeting the Iranian official named outsourcing agriculture production and establishment of joint transportation companies as the major possible fields of cooperation between the two sides. He referred to oil and gas, electricity, medicine, and medical equipment as the other sectors proper for cooperation.  As the ICCIMA chairman added elsewhere, the two countries’ tradesmen, presently, do not share their required data for doing trade with each other, while data transfer in this regard is a must.  “ICCIMA will back transfer of data as well as commute of business delegations between Iran and Moldova,” he vowed.  
 
The Moldovan president, for his part, lamented that despite the available potentials, Iran-Moldova trade is not satisfactory and currently stands at $1.5 billion to $2 billion per annum. 
 
Underscoring the vitality of increasing the number of traveling business delegations between the two countries, Dodon said that Iranian and Moldovan tradesmen should start their meetings by the current yearend.  He also called trade, transit, and investment as the three main areas of cooperation between the two countries.
