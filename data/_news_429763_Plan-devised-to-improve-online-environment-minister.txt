TEHRAN -- The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plans to improve online environment for kids, the ICT minister wrote on his Instagram account, Mehr reported. “Despite the rapid growth of IT in Iran, the content for children and online parental control has not improved in recent years, causing damages by ignoring the children’s safety,” Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi lamented. The ICT ministry has urged NGOs and artists in order to modify content creation for children in cyberspace, he explained. The ministry also plans to hold a festival on web series and online short films for children, he explained. In mid-November, the ICT ministry released a survey according to which, only eight percent of Iranian parents monitor their children’s online activity in Iran, the minister wrote on his Twitter account last week. The ministry is projected to introduce parental control applications in the near future.
