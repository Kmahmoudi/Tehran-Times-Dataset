The statement said in recent days security forces, who are preserving law and order, had to deal with a variety of cult-like organizations, agents of foreign spy agencies, fooled agents of rioters on the streets as well as direct involvement of the American and British governments and their Saudi allies. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry highlighted the fact that 49 MKO terrorists have been detained for actively disseminating false information, inciting protestors to carry out terror and sabotage acts, directing slogans, and being present in the streets to cause damage to public property. The ministry reported that 77 mercenaries, including those aligned with groups trained by the Zionist regime such as Komala Party of Kurdistan, Kurdistan Democratic Party, PAK (Parti Azadi Kurdistan) and PJAK (Kurdistan Free Life Party) have also been detained on the two sides of Iran’s western borders.
