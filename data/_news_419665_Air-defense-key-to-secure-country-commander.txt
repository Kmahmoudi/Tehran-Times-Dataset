TEHRAN – A top commander said on Sunday that air defense is a main force against possible attacks against the country.  “New threats can only be posed through the sky,” General Ali Qolami, an advisor to the commander-in-chief, told a meeting of graduate students in Isfahan. Qolami said air defense is at the forefront of securing the country against the enemy, Mehr reported. During the Iran-Iraq war the enemy realized that it cannot enter a ground war with the Islamic Republic, he pointed out. In view of these facts it is necessary to boost its air defense capabilities, he proposed.
