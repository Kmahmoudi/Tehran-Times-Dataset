TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov discussed bilateral relations and regional developments in a phone conversation on Thursday. The two sides talked about bilateral ties and regional developments, issues pertaining to the Caspian Sea and Russia’s veto of an anti-Iran resolution at the UN, IRNA reported. The British-drafted resolution, which was backed by the U.S., accused Iran of violating UN arms embargo on Yemen. Washington in a recent series of attempts has targeted Iran's missile capabilities, accusing Tehran of sending missiles to Yemeni Houthis. Iran has vehemently rejected the allegations and Russia has insisted there is no credible evidence to prove the claim.
