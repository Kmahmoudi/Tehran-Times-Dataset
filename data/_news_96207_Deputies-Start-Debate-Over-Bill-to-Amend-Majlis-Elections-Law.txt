The amendment is one of the twin bills that President Mohammad Khatami in a news conference five months ago said he would submit to the Majlis for approval which would grant him more control over state affairs. The Majlis Elections Law has been revised several times thus far, but deputies supporting President Khatami seek to remove an article concerning approbatory supervision by the Guardian Council (GC). However, it appears likely that the GC will veto the bill, and this, analysts say, would trigger severe reaction by certain political power camps. Majlis is also set to begin final debate about the budget bill for the next Iranian calendar year (beginning March 21, 2003). Therefore, debate over the Elections Law is postponed till the budget bill is passed.
