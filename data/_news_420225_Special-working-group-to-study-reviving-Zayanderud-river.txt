TEHRAN – A special working group tasked with studying ways for reviving Zayanderud river and also addressing Isfahan province’s water shortage will be established by Ministry of Energy, IRIB reported on Wednesday. MP Seyyed Naser Mousavi Largani has said the decision was made in a meeting with former minister of energy Hamid Chitchian and First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri. Largani didn’t give any further details on the exact date of the meeting and the working group’s restoration programs.  Zayanderud river starts in the Zard-Kuh subrange of the Zagros Mountains and flows 400 kilometers eastward before ending in the Gavkhouni swamp in southeast of Isfahan city. Once wide and mighty, Zayanderud river has been coping with drought in recent years. The river drought has resulted in wide range of problems for people, particularly farmers, of the related regions.
