TEHRAN â€“ Restoration work of Darvazeh Quran, a historical gate which leads to the city of Shiraz, has been completed. Darvazeh Quran (literally meaning Quran gate), is of great importance as a symbol of Shiraz. The gate is also home to a magnificent copy of the holy Quran, a phenomenon that makes it a blessed place in the minds of people, ISNA quoted a local official as saying on Tuesday. The refurbished face of the monument will be unveiled on February 11 that also marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, the official added. Standing at an entrance to Shiraz, the gate is believed to bless people who pass beneath it before they undertake journeys by means of a copy of the holy Quran being embedded at a small room atop. The rectangular-based monument was initially built in the 18th century during Zand dynasty. However, it succumbed to several multiple quakes, which stroke the city during Qajar era (1785 to 1925). Over its history, the monument has underwent several restoration and renewal projects. Shiraz is home to dozens of magnificent buildings, historical sites and scenic landscapes. It was literally the capital of Persia during the Zand dynasty from 1751 to 1794. AFM/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
