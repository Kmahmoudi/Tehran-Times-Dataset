TEHRAN – On Sunday, senior Iranian officials held a series of meetings with a number of foreign officials who arrived in Tehran to attend the Saturday inauguration ceremony of President Hassan Rouhani.   Some 1200 guests, including 700 senior Iranian officials and 500 prominent officials from other countries, participated in the inauguration ceremony on Saturday.  The senior-level meetings in Tehran signify the important status of Iran in a region torn apart by conflicts. Also, participation of more than a hundred of political figures, including European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, indicates the failure of attempts by certain regional countries to isolate Iran.  Among those who held talks with Rouhani were Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan, Lebanese Parliament Speaker with Nabih Berri, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, etc.
In the meeting with Sargsyan, Rouhani said Iran seeks to expand relations with the neighboring counties, especially Armenia. “There are many grounds for the two countries to expand ties in areas of economy, culture, transportation, energy and tourism,” Rouhani stated. He also highlighted the importance of close cooperation among regional countries in fighting terrorism and showing vigilance in face of dangers posed by terrorism. For his part, Sargsyan called for expansion of relations in various spheres. ‘Celebration of democracy’  Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in an appearance with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Tehran on August 6, 2017.   During the meeting with Berri, Rouhani said that Iran and Lebanon have always enjoyed friendly relations.
