TEHRAN- The first four of the passenger jets, 72-600 turboprop aircraft, purchased from the European plane maker ATR, will land in Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport on Wednesday, Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told IRNA on Tuesday. Iran has paid all the prepayments to ATR, the official said, adding that 15 to 20 percent of the total $400 million is paid by Iran and the rest is funded via foreign financers. "I hope that with the arrival of the ATR72-600, we'll benefit from the best efficiency and reliability," Iran Air Managing Director Farhad Parvaresh twitted on Tuesday.  "We are very happy to receive this unique type of ATR72-600 that we've never operated before," he added. The deliveries will bring to seven the number of new Western aircrafts delivered to Iran since trade reopened under a deal between Tehran and major powers to drop most sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. The 70-seat ATR 72-600 is worth $26.8 million at list prices. Iran Air is expected to take delivery of the remaining 16 ATR aircrafts by the end of 2018, including another five this year, according to Reuters.
