TEHRAN - The Islamic State group threatened Iran for its role in the region’s conflicts, in a rare Farsi-language propaganda video released on Monday. The 36-minute video, entitled “The Farsi Land: from Yesterday till Today”, was issued through ISIS’s social media channels from Diyala province in neighboring Iraq. Iran has been of great help in Syrian and Iraqi battlefields in fighting ISIS terrorists and this is not the first time the country is threatened by the terrorist group.   Last year, Iran’s Army’s ground forces commander Brigadier General Ahmad Pourdastan said Iran would not hesitate to launch attacks on terrorists in case they come close to 40 kilometers away from Iranian borders with Iraq or Afghanistan.  ISIS and other extremists consider Shiites to be apostates, and the video accuses Iranians of persecuting Sunnis over the centuries and into modern times. “We will conquer Iran and restore it to the Sunni Muslim nation as it was before,” says a man in the video. The video also chastises Iran for its tolerance towards Jews. “Iran raised its slogans against the U.S. and Israel to deceive the Sunnis while Iranian Jews live safely in Iran under its protection, and it has provided them with temples and churches as seen in Tehran and Isfahan,” the narrator says. Western and Eastern borders of Iran have been a hotbed for terrorist activities, mainly influenced by weak border monitoring of neighboring countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Annually, Iranian forces bust terrorists groups in the regions, while losing forces, keeping a vigilant eye on its mainland. The country intelligence officers have already proven themselves, preventing terrorist blasts in the country, while its vast borders are surrounded by terrorist teams. Last June, Iran’s Intelligence Ministry issued a statement on Monday, announcing it has foiled one of the biggest terrorist plots of “Takfiri-Wahhabi groups” in Tehran and some other cities. Reportedly, the arrestees, ten, planned to bomb 50 targets in crowded areas of Tehran.
