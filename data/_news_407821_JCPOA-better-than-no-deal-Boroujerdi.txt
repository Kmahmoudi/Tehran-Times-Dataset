TEHRAN – Chairman of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Majlis believes the JCPOA, the official for the nuclear deal, is better than no agreement. In an interview with the Mehr news agency published on Saturday, Alaeddin Boroujerdi said “positive traces” of the JCPOA have already emerged. For example, he said, the least positive result of the nuclear deal is that now Iran is now producing oil at the level it used to before the sanctions. Boroujerdi said it was also a great success for the Islamic Republic that the West finally recognized Iran’s right to nuclear technology. “The outcome of the JCPOA was that they officially accepted our (nuclear) activities and this is very important,” he stressed.
 
In the meantime, he accused the United States of being the “big time violator” of the JCPOA implementation. In response to the critics of the JCPOA, he said there is no doubt that the United States is not honest but it should be noted that “your were facing an enemy with the name of America which had sanctioned you at the (UN) Security Council and limited (the sale of) your oil, which is the main pillar of your economy, to one million barrels (per day).”
