TEHRAN - Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said in a televised interview on Thursday that threats against Iran have become “more serious” after the conclusion of the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Mohammad Ali Jafari also said unfortunately some officials ignore the revolution’s causes. On the Western countries’ propaganda against Iran’s missile program, the major general said the missile capability is “preemptive” and the West does not want Iran to be powerful in order to exert pressure on the country. He also said that the IRGC provides the government with support in spite of some different views on economic, political and cultural areas. Commenting on the crises in the Middle East region, he said that some countries such as Saudi Arabia are following Israel’s policies.
