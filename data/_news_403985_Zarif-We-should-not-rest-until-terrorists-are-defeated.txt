 “We should not and will not rest until those behind terror in Istanbul, Dhaka, and now Baghdad, and their ideology, are defeated,” Zarif wrote in his Twitter account on Monday. A deadly terrorist attack on Ataturk Airport in Istanbul on June 28 left 41 people killed and 230 others injured. Two separate bomb attacks at a busy commercial street in Baghdad around midnight Saturday also left at least 213 killed and 150 wounded. On Friday, gunmen also attacked the people at a restaurant in Dhaka and took hostages and exchanged gunfire with police until police forces moved in and killed the gunmen. Twenty people inside the restaurant were killed, along with two police officers and six terrorists. In another Twitter message on Sunday, Zarif wrote, “Latest terror attack in Dhaka, less headline-making in the West, nonetheless shows we must be united in ridding our world of this evil.” The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for attacks in Baghdad and Dhaka.
