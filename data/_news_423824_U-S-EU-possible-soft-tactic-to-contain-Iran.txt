The U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has created a new rounds of speculations about the three European major players’ (the UK, France and Germany) capabilities and abilities to keep the deal alive without the U.S. Following the U.S. President’s unilateral move to withdraw from the Iran’s Nuclear Deal, lots of diplomatic and political efforts have been made both by the European and Iranian officials to keep the internationally achieved deal alive.    Islamic Republic of Iran has announced that it will remain in the JCPOA just if the EU can guarantee Iran’s benefits and interests under the JCPOA in the absence of the U.S., otherwise Tehran will leave the deal, too. Despite all measures taken and political promises made by the European sides to keep the JCPOA alive, over the past ten days many big EU firms and international companies have announced their decisions to stop their activities and operations in Iran including Total, Eni, Siemens, Airbus and Maersk. Just couple of days after the U.S. withdraw from the JCPOA, French gas and oil giant Total has announced that due to return of the U.S. sanctions against Iran it has to pull out of Iranian Southern Pars oil field. Italian oil giant Eni has also decided to abrogate its agreement with Iran to study oil and gas in Iran. Maersk as the biggest shipping company in the world has announced that due to its vast activities in the U.S. and to avoid possible U.S. punishments, it will stop its activities in Iran. Considering the limited capabilities and potentialities of the EU to challenge the U.S. hegemony and also the fact that EU governments cannot force private sectors to work with Iran, it is not realistic to expect the EU to save the JCPOA. As I mentioned in my previous writing, the possibility of job division between the U.S. and EU to contain Iran should not be ignored. All facts on the ground imply that all EU measures and promises to keep the JCPOA alive will only result in remaining of some small European companies in Iran. Big companies that can invest and transfer technology to Iran will leave Iran to avoid the U.S. possible punishments. This possible soft and indirect U.S.-EU tactic can help the joint goal of the U.S. and EU to contain Iran. By this tactic, firstly the EU can buy time and contain Iran so that not to leave the JCPOA. Secondly, the EU will pave the way for selling of its products and services in Iran’s market without investment and transferring technology. Thirdly, Iran’s incomes and revenues will be limited which Americans and the Europeans consider it as a good soft and indirect way to increase pressure on Iran to limit Iran’s regional influence and missile capability.
