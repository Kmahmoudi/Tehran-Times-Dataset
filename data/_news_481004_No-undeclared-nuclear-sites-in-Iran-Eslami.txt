TEHRAN – Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), said Wednesday that there are no undeclared nuclear sites in Iran.  Speaking on the sidelines of a cabinet session on Wednesday, Eslami said Iran is focused on clarification and answering questions regarding its nuclear activity.  “The issue that has been on our agenda has been to resolve the ambiguities and respond to them. The accusations that the anti-revolutionary elements have made over the years have been investigated by the Agency and all its steps have been taken,” Eslami said, according to Iran’s official news agency IRNA.  He was referring to a safeguards probe by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over nuclear materials allegedly found in Iran.  “As a result of all the negotiations that took place within twenty years, the JCPOA document has been concluded. They abandoned the JCPOA document and intend to return to it, and again put the accusations next to the JCPOA document, while these are not two issues but one issue,” he said.  He said, “We clearly state that according to the Agency itself, there is no undeclared nuclear activity or site in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Our interactions are established and Mr. Grossi announced his readiness to be in Iran. And the program, content and goals of the trip should be arranged.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
