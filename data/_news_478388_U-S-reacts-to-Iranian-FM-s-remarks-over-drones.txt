TEHRAN- On Saturday, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley reacted to remarks by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian regarding drones produced in Iran and sent to Russia before the Ukraine war. Amir Abdollahian said earlier in the day that Iran had given Russia a limited number of drones months before the start of the Ukraine war, that began in February 2022. The senior Iranian diplomat said that if it was established that Russia had utilized the unmanned Iranian aircraft against Ukraine, his nation "would not stay indifferent". According to Reuters, Malley claimed that Amir Abdollahian's assertions that Iran had dispatched a few drones were false. He said that "dozens" had been sent just last summer, and that "military personnel in the occupied Ukraine are helping Russia utilize them." Amir Abdollahian also commented on the matter, stating that Iran and Ukraine were scheduled to meet two weeks ago "in a European country" in a bid that Kiev could provide proof of Russia's deployment of Iranian drones in Ukraine. He stated that although an Iranian delegation visited that country in Europe, the Ukrainian side was regrettably absent. According to the foreign minister, Ukraine did not attend the negotiations because the U.S. and several European nations, particularly Germany, had requested that it do so, saying that they were contemplating penalties against Iran over the matter. Following that, Amir Abdollahian continued, he and his Ukrainian counterpart agreed last week that Kiev produce proof, if any, to evaluate the claims. Emphasizing that Iran seeks an end to the Ukraine crisis and wants both parties to resume dialogue, the foreign minister added, “If it is proven that Russia has used Iranian drones against Ukraine in the war, we will not remain indifferent.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
