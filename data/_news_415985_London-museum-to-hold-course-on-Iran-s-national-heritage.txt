TEHRAN – The Victoria and Albert Museum in London is set to hold a short course on the art history of Iran that will take a peek into its rich national heritage from the time of Achaemenid Persian Empire (c. 550-330) to the modern Islamic Republic.  The course will draw fully from the V&A’s unique and extensive Iranian collections such as luster tilework, silver-inlaid metalwork, and enormous knotted pile carpets, with object-viewing sessions and store visits throughout the Museum, the museum website says. “While surveying the art history of Iran, the course will also provide thoughtful analysis of the Museum’s collecting history in the nineteenth century, when ‘Persian Art’ was pursued vigorously.” Dr. Moya Carey, the Iran Heritage Foundation curator for the Iranian collections at the V&A, will lead the course, which will be held from January 10 to March 21, 2018.
