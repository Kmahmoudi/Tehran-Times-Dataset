What the Arab world has been experiencing in the last months has been a source of inspiration for the entire world. Seeing millions rise up against arbitrary and dictatorial government has, hopefully, given the rest of us the motivation to keep fighting for a democratic and dignified life. These uprisings have revolved around a very specific rhetoric which is closely connected to their demand for democracy; the call for a dignified life, the need to reinstate oneâ€™s pride, and the desire to be the actors rather than subjects of their own history. Although recently the Arab revolutions have taken the front stage of the media, the Palestinian cause represents all such demands at the highest level. Their struggle to establish a state on their own land has been driven by similar causes. What the Palestinians in the occupied territories have been subjected to, above everything else, is the inability to control their own futures.
