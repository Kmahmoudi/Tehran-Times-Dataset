TEHRAN – A review by the consolidated planning department of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) showed that 56 percent of the company’s investment resources have been allocated to the development of joint oil and gas fields in the current Iranian calendar year (which ends on March 20). As reported by IRIB news on Saturday, of the remaining 44 percent, 33 percent has been allocated to optimizing and maintaining production levels at the active oil and gas fields, 2 percent is used for infrastructure and construction projects in oil rich regions and final 9 percent is spent on other oil and gas projects.
