TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday that Iran will continue to support the Palestinian people’s resistance against the Israeli regime.
 In a phone conversation with Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Zarif urged the Islamic community and the UN to support the Palestinians’ legitimate demands and condemn the Zionist regime of Israel’s crimes. He said that Iran plans to pursue Israel’s crimes against Palestinians at the UN General Assembly, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Haniyeh praised Iran’s principled policy in supporting the Palestinian people. Foreign Minister Zarif says Iran plans to pursue Israel’s crimes against Palestinians at the UN General Assembly, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. On Friday Palestinians in the Gaza Strip marched to the fence with the occupied lands at the start of a six-week protest dubbed “The Great March of Return,” demanding the right of return for Palestinians driven out of their homeland. However, the Israeli army unleashed a storm of live ammunition, tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets on the Palestinians, killing 18 people and injuring almost 1,500 ones. In a tweet on Saturday Zarif said, “On the eve of Passover (of all days), which commemorates God liberating Prophet Moses and his people from tyranny, Zionist tyrants murder peaceful Palestinian protesters—whose land they have stolen—as they march to escape their cruel and inhuman apartheid bondage.” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi also strongly condemned the killing and injuring of Palestinian protesters by the “racist” Israeli regime in Gaza, saying that the latest crime revealed the regime’s “inhumane nature”. The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) also issued a statement on Saturday voicing its readiness to provide whatever support is necessary to the Palestinian people in the face of the Israeli regime’s ongoing crimes in the occupied territories. According to Press TV, Human Rights Watch has also slammed Israel’s killing of Palestinian protesters as “unlawful” and “calculated”.
