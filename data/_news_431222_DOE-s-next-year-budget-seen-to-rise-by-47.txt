Moreover, Amir Zand, caretaker of DOE’s budget and planning center also said on December 23 that some 55.7 billion rials (about $1.3 million) is considered for combatting air pollution and a total of 1.67 trillion rials (nearly $40 million) will be allotted to protecting the biodiversity through restoration of the country's wetlands, as well as conservation and revival of Golestan National Park and areas under the organization’s protection. He went on to highlight that another 51.8 billion rials (approximately $1.2 million) will also be earmarked for research and development in environmental issues. Zand further stated that a budget amounting to 10 trillion rials (around $240 million) is proposed in the budget bill to create regional facilities for waste management by private sector, aiming at reducing irreparable damages caused by poor waste management, especially in the northern cities of the country. Referring to 40 percent increase in development plans budget for the DOE, he noted that for development plans also a credit of 2.43 trillion rials (around $58 million) will be allocated.
