TEHRAN – Seyyed Reza Fatemi Amin retained his post as minister of industry, mining and trade in an impeachment session of the parliament (Majlis) on Tuesday. Out of 274 MPs present in the parliament, only 84 MPs voted against Fatami Amin. However, 182 MPs voted to keep him in his job. There were six abstention votes and two invalid ones.  The post of industry, mining and trade minister is highly important as Iran is fighting crippling economic sanctions imposed illegally by the United States. To reduce the burden, the government plans to separate the trade ministry. The trade ministry was merged with the industry and mines ministry in 2011. The main opponents of the minister are mostly those who are unhappy with the quality of the locally-produced cars, something which the minister himself acknowledged it in defending his record in the impeachment session. Mohammadreza Rezaei Kouchi, chairman of the Majlis infrastructure committee, opposed impeachment. He said unseating the minister will cause “instability” in the government’s economic team and the experience of the previous government will be repeated. Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said the vote of confidence for Fatemi Amin will create an opportunity for the minister to implement his promises so that people can “feel” it.
