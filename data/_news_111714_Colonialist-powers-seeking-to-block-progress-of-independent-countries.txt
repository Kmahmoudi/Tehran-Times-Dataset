Haddad-Adel, who is currently in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela heading a high-ranking delegation, told members of the Venezuelan Parliament that in recent years, the Iranian nation and officials have eagerly followed developments in the friendly country of Venezuela because the fate of these two revolutionary countries is intertwined, and this has led to closer relations between the two nations. Underlining the fact that bilateral relations between Iran and Venezuela have been promoted, Hadad-Adel expressed hope that the two nations would soon witness the fruition of their efforts in all political, economic, and cultural spheres. He also said that the policies of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Iranian officials, who have adopting independent policies and rejected all hegemonic policies, have helped to strengthen diplomatic ties between Iran and Venezuela. He went on to say that the Islamic Republic of Iran has mobilized all its revolutionary experiences and all its economic and technological capabilities in order to help the Venezuelan government, adding that the conclusion of over 100 agreements and MOUs with the South American country over the past two years indicates Iran’s recognition of Venezuela’s strategic status. The Iranian Majlis speaker also stated that Iran-Venezuela bilateral relations are not being expanded only to meet economic and commercial objectives, since the two countries have a more significant mission, that is, to unite in solidarity. Although a proper opportunity was created for establishing world peace and justice through dialogue among civilizations after the collapse of the bipolar world order, the neocolonialist policies of the United States have nullified those opportunities, Haddad-Adel opined. The unilateralist policies of the United States not only frustrated the people’s hopes for world peace and disarmament but also inflicted much damage on various nations by fanning the flames of terrorism and trampling upon human rights and the national sovereignty of other countries, he observed. Haddad-Adel said that the Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly declared that its nuclear activities are quite peaceful, adding that those who accuse Iran of violating international treaties themselves possess thousands of nuclear warheads and are involved in illegal nuclear activities. At this juncture, the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Middle East and Venezuela in Latin America should act as two constructive axes to neutralize the conspiracies of the global arrogance (the U.S.), he suggested. He also expressed gratitude to Venezuela for voting against the recent IAEA Board of Governors resolution reporting Iran’s nuclear dossier to the UN Security Council. Haddad-Adel went on to say that the Iranian Majlis has always been in favor of expanding relations with Venezuela, adding that five trade agreements were recently concluded between Iran and Venezuela in order to prove Iran’s strong interest in fostering friendship with the Bolivarian Republic.
