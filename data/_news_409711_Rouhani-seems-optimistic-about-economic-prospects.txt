TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said late on Sunday that he is optimistic about the prospects of the country’s economy.
 “I am very optimistic about the future of the country’s economic situation,” Rouhani told a televised interview. He also reassured the people that the foreign currencies’ rates will not keep going up. “The dollar has gained against all currencies in the past few months and it is natural if it also gains in Iran. But the rate of exchange of foreign currencies will certainly not remain at current levels,” Reuters quoted Rouhani as saying. “The stability of (currency) markets is important for the government. The economy has to be predictable so that exporters and importers can act with trust,” he said. Elsewhere, Rouhani attached great importance to the Citizen Rights Charter, noting the people should be aware of their rights. He added that all the bodies should cooperate to implement the Citizen Rights Charter. The president declared the rights charter on December 19. The charter, which comprises 120 articles, insists on the right to a “decent life” such as right to clean water, health services, freedom of speech, clean environment, holding rallies, access to information, etc.  ‘JCPOA benefits all sides’ Rouhani also defended the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, saying it is a “win-win” game which is “beneficial” to all sides. He added, “I have no doubt that the JCPOA was a great job by the Iranian nation. This is a national achievement.”  However, the president said he sees “no problem if one expresses his view” about the JCPOA “and criticize” it. “This is something natural in a democratic society. All are free to talk in our society,” he told the live TV program. He went on to say that the people did an “epic” in 2013 presidential election by making the international atmosphere appropriate for nuclear negotiations.  In his campaigns prior to the June 2013 election, Rouhani vowed to resolve the nuclear dispute with the West, saying “The wheels of centrifuges and the wheels of people’s life should both turn.”  Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany - finalized the text of the JCPOA in Vienna in July 2015. The deal went into effect in January 2016. Rouhani also said that international deal defeated the Iranophobia project, adding the world has admitted Iran’s “constructive” role.
  
‘Mideast crises can be settled through diplomacy and resistance’  Rouhani also said Iran supports the countries’ territorial integrity and is against changing geographical borders. The president was indirectly referring to efforts by certain regional and extra-regional powers to divide up Syria. He also said that Iran helps countries fight terrorism upon their request. Again the president was indirectly suggesting that Iran is giving military advice to Syria and Iraq in their wars against terrorists upon formal requests by these two countries.
 
Iran has spared no effort in fighting terrorism, he said, added conflicts in the Middle East region can be settled through “diplomacy” and “resistance”. He described “diplomacy” and “resistance” as two sides of the same coin. He also said that Iran, Russia and Turkey have taken good steps in fighting terrorism and expressed hope that planned dialogue between Syria and opposition groups would bear fruit. Elsewhere, Rouhani said that Iran plays an important role in fighting terrorism and regional diplomacy. Diplomacy is the “final solution” to the regional crises, he said. NA/PA
