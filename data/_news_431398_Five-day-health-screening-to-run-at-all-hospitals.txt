TEHRAN- A health screening program for all Iranians over the age of 30 will be piloted from January 12 to 16 in both public and private hospitals, the deputy health minister for nursing announced. According to Maryam Hazrati, checking adults’ blood pressure, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) are among the main objectives of the program, Mehr news agency reported on Saturday. “The best way to improve health is prevention; and the most cost-effective and influential method of prevention is at primary level when measures are taken to avoid development of a disease or disability in healthy individuals,” Hazrati remarked. Unfortunately, around 6.5 million Iranians are unaware of their high blood pressure while its prevalence has grown by 62% compared to 25 years ago.“Such primary preventive measures include encouraging people to have a healthier lifestyle, a well-balanced diet, regular exercise and physical activities as well as trying to keep a healthy mental state,” she further explained.  “Obesity and high blood pressure are now silent killers in our society, taking more lives than ever; however, both conditions can be prevented with a healthy life style and their progression can be majorly inhibited by early diagnosis,” said Hazrati.  According to her, the pilot program will also include teaching the examined people about how to have a healthy life style, manage their weight and blood pressure.  “Unfortunately, around 6.5 million Iranians are unaware of their high blood pressure while its prevalence has grown by 62% compared to 25 years ago,” she regretted. According to Hazrati, excessive consumption of salt is the main reason for prevalence of high blood pressure in society.  Last week, the head of the Iranian Heart Association announced that salt consumption in Iran is twice as much as global standards. According to Fereydoun Noohi, the average salt intake among Iranians is around 10-12 grams per day, which is far beyond standard levels. On December 23, the Health Ministry’s department for non-communicable diseases announced that obesity and overweight have affected about 65 percent of the country’s population, while physical inactivity is the main reason behind.
