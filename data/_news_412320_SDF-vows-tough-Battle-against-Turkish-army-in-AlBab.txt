TEHRAN - The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) warned on Monday that it will soon launch an offensive on the Turkish army in Northern Aleppo province to push the foreign military troops out of the highly strategic region of Al-Bab. The SDF, Turkish army and the Syrian government troops have been fighting ISIL terrorists in Aleppo province. Last month, the Turkish army managed to eventually capture the city of Al-Bab after weeks of clashes with the ISIL that inflicted heavy losses on the Turkish military troops and their allied militants. The Turkish army first won a major part of the city, but was forced to retreat almost from all captured areas after ISIL inflicted heavy casualties on its soldiers. Yet, the Turkish troops and its allied militants could win the city back from the ISIL after the Syrian army laid a tight siege on the Southern outskirts of Al-Bab and cut off the terrorists' supply route from the strategic city of Deir Hafer in Eastern Aleppo. The Syrian army next captured Deir Hafer to win the last major ISIL stronghold in Aleppo province and find a platform to launch an attack on Raqqa, the de facto capital of the terrorist group. The SDF also played a complementary role in the war against ISIL in Northern and North-Eastern Aleppo as they pushed the terrorist group back from dozens of towns and villages on the Western side of the Tishrin Dam, completing the circle of enemy forces around ISIL. Ever since the Turkish army's victory in Al-Bab, tensions have gone high between Ankara and the Kurdish-majority SDF troops. Ankara has warned to engage in war on the Kurds if they reject to evacuate all areas they have captured on the Western side of the Tishrin Dam, including the Kurdish-populated city of Manbij. They Syrian army next drove a wedge between the Kurds and the Turks to warn Ankara that it would not allow any Turkish army attack on its population. Now, the SDF is returning Ankara's threat with tough warnings, saying that they will soon force the Turkish army out of Al-Bab. "The SDF will not allow Turkey to approach the recently liberated areas and will drive the Turkish army out of Al-Bab," a senior SDF field commander said on Monday. Ommar Rahmano, a commander of Jeish Al-Thawar that operates under the SDF, further declared that his troops have inflicted heavy loss and casualties on the Turkish army. "We will take back all Shahba' regions in the Afrin Canton that have been occupied by the Turkish army," he vowed. The Kurdish population lives in three regions, known as Cantons, in Northern Syria, with the Afrin Canton being located on the Western side of the Euphrates stretching over the Northern parts of Aleppo province with Manbij as its most important and most internationally known town.
