TEHRAN – Europeans have constituted the highest number of arrivals in Iran’s Shahdad desert since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21), ISNA reported.  Shahdad - a major part of the Lut desert in southeastern Kerman province - is home to massive sand pyramids created by wind and water. The “Lut” plain is a natural landscape of Iran which is a UNESCO registered site. Over 2,300 foreign nationals stayed in eco-lodges across Shahdad during the aforementioned period, which shows 25 percent rise year on year, said Gholamreza Farrokhi, the provincial tourism chief. Most of foreign visitors to Shahdad are from European countries including Germany, Italy, Spain and France, the official said. The big and sprawling Kerman province has been a cultural melting pot since antiquity, blending Persians with subcontinental tribe dwellers. It is home to myriad historical sites and scenic landscapes such as Bazaar-e Sartasari, Jabalieh Dome, Ganjali Khan Bathhouse, Malek Jameh Mosque and Shahdad Desert to name a few.
