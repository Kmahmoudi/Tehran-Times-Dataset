TEHRAN – Turkey doesn’t see any reason why the U.S. has withdrawn from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), since Iran was standing by its commitments in the agreement, the ambassador of Turkey to Iran has said.

 “We were disappointed with the U.S. decision to withdraw from the JCPOA. We work to support the regional stability, together with Azerbaijan and Iran and we would like to see the full implementation of the international agreements,” Reza Hakan Tekin told Trend. “Iran’s position on the agreement was also supported by the International Energy Agency and many other countries and organizations,” said the ambassador.
