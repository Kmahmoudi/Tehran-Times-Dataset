TEHRAN – While the average dry waste collection rate has been 3 percent in the past, it will increase by 20 percent by the end of the [current Iranian calendar] year (March 20, 2019), the mayor of Tehran’s district 22 has said. In the past, dry waste collection rate in the city was 3 percent, which has risen to 9 percent in recent years, IRIB quoted Ali Nozarpour-Baqeri as saying on Saturday. Moreover, it is planned to increase the rate by 20 percent over the course of 7 months, he highlighted. According to a report published by United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in October 2016, waste generation per capita in Iran’s urban areas is about 658 grams per day while Iranian waste generation per capita in rural areas is about 220-340 grams per day. Average Iranian waste generation per capita amounts to some 240 kilograms per year.  In Tehran alone waste generation per capita is estimated at 750-800 grams per day and each Tehrani citizen generates about 270-450 kilograms of waste per years. The report continues that unfortunately only 7 percent of the waste is separated at the source, 13 percent is recycled and only 2.5 percent of them end up in formal or sanitary landfills and some 77.5 percent of the waste will be burnt or buried in informal landfills located in the countryside or deserts near cities.
