TEHRAN - Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, has said that the “fake” and “illegitimate” Zionist regime of Israel is in its weakest situation.
 “Undoubtedly, Tel Aviv is in weakest situation in spite of Daesh service to the Zionists by weakening and damaging some of the Islamic countries,” he said in a post on his Telegram on Saturday. The former Iranian point man for the Arab world said the U.S. and Saudi Arabia will not be able to save Israel. He said Israel is an occupier which is making efforts to “survive by building cement walls” around itself.  The foreign policy advisor said Israel will not be permitted to play with the security of the Middle East.
