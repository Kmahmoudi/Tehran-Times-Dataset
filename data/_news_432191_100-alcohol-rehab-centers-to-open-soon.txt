TEHRAN- Alcohol rehab centers will soon open in 100 substance abuse centers that are already at work in the country, said Mehdi Shadnoush, head of the Health Ministry's management center for transplantation and special diseases.  “We also aim to establish a specialized committee in order to devise specific clinical guidelines and determine a set of possible services for treating substance abuse in children and teenagers,” said Shadnoush.  On Sunday, deputy head of anti-narcotics taskforce said some 330 billion rials (nearly $8 million) has been earmarked for drug addiction prevention programs, but a greater budget is required to address the issue.   According to Aref Vahabzadeh, parenting plays a significant role in preventing children from addiction or drug use, adding that parenting training packages are domestically prepared and supplied to families across the country. Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. Policies which influence the levels and patterns of substance use and related harm can significantly reduce the public health problems attributable to substance use, and interventions at the health care system level can work towards the restoration of health in affected individuals.
