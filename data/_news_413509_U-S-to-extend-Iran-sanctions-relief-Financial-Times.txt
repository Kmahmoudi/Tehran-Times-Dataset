Donald Trump’s administration is likely to uphold its part of the historic nuclear deal with Iran this week and extend sanctions’ relief, people close to the issue have told the Financial Times.
 Three people told the Financial Times that the administration was set to renew waivers that exempt non-U.S. companies from sanctions for doing business with Iran, adding that officials from the U.S. and elsewhere had already informed Tehran the waivers would remain in place. “If they don’t renew the waivers they will have a big mess on their hands,” said Timothy O’Toole, a sanctions attorney at Miller & Chevalier, a law firm. “Iran would have no impediment to restarting its nuclear program.” In comments that also indicate the U.S. will certify the waiver renewals, a State Department official told the Financial Times that “until this review is completed, we will adhere to the [deal]”. During his campaign for the presidency, Trump said his “number-one priority [was] to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran”. However, EU foreign ministers and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini have expressed “resolute” commitment to the implementation of the nuclear agreement.
