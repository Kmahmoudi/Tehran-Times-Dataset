German industrial group Siemens has shipped the first F-class gas turbine for Iran’s 600-MW Bandar Abbas power plant, six months after signing an energy agreement with the Iran’s power-generator constructors, MAPNA Group. This is the first stage of the bilateral contract covering the transfer of know-how for this model turbine technology between Siemens and MAPNA. Siemens was one of the first major companies to agree on deal with Iran after lifting of sanctions in January 2016, signing a $1.6 billion memorandum of understanding on Iran’s rail infrastructure and a long-term road-map with MAPNA on the power sector. Seimens will deliver more than 20 gas turbines as well as the associated generators over the next four to five years. Iran has planned to invest $30 billion by 2021 in the power sector, including construction of new power plants, expansion of network and increasing the share of the combined-cycle power plants in the total electricity generation from the current 25 percent to 50 percent. Thermal power plants generate 83 percent of Iran’s total electricity.
