TEHRAN- Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) Commander Hossein Salami stated on Thursday that the unrest in “our cities” will go to capital cities like Washington, London, Tel Aviv, and Riyadh since engagements do not only take place in specific locations but also continue in many other regions of the world. The IRGC chief was openly referring to the incitement of unrest in Iran (that followed the tragic death of Mahsa Amini last month) by certain Western countries through their statements or media outlets such as the BBC Persian, Manoto, and Iran International headquartered in London as well as the Voice of America and Radio Farda that are run by the U.S. government.  Iran International, which has taken the lead in disinformation campaign and distortion of the facts since the unrest began in Iran, is funded by Saudi Arabia. The agenda followed by this network is set by Israel.      Speaking on the role of universities in enlightening the public about the motivations behind the agenda of countries that fan the flames of unrest in Iran, General Salami suggested that university teachers shape the intellectual foundation of “our nation's future leaders' brains”. "The university professors with their scientific Jihad, based on divine and revolutionary beliefs of the society, train our youth for shouldering major roles in the bright future of the merging Islamic civilization," he added. According to the IRGC commander, the current situation in Iran represents the biggest clash between the Islamic Revolution and the fading oppressive system. Commander Salami went on to highlight that “the main essence of this strategic encounter is the encounter between ignorance and awareness. The root cause and main source of these unrests is precisely in the exact information in the centers and heart of the oppression system.” The IRGC commander noted that a new world order is replacing the corrupt and outdated one that is seeing a decline in power. “What we are now witnesses to, is the intensive, continuous and serial defeats of the global arrogance, throughout four decades of the life of the Islamic Revolution, which means this intensive revenge due to those intensive defeats has led to a declining spiral for the oppression system,” he remarked.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
