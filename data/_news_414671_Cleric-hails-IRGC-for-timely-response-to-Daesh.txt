TEHRAN – Tehran's interim Friday prayers leader has lauded the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps for inflicting heavy losses on Daesh in Deir Ezzur, Syria, in retaliation for the terrorist group's attacks in Tehran in early June.

 Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani said, "The Guards’ missile launch was timely; we hope that the terrorists and their sponsors will understand that Iran does not tolerate such acts of terror and will give them some firm response." SP/PA
