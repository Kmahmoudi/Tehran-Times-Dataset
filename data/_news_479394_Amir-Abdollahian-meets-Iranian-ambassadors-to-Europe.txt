TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian who, at the invitation of his Serbian counterpart, is on an official visit to Serbia, held consultations with the Europe-based Iranian ambassadors on Sunday night.  The latest developments regarding Iran-Europe ties were discussed during the meeting in Belgrade, according to the Iranian foreign ministry.  The top Iranian diplomat and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s ambassadors exchanged views in political and economic fields while discussing regional and international developments. Amir Abdollahian also stressed that Iranian ambassadors and missions in Europe should pay special attention to issues pertaining to providing Iranian expatriates with suitable services, particularly in facilitating the provision of consular services to them. The foreign minister recently held a phone conversation with High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell on issues of mutual significance. During the talks, Amir Abdollahian expressed gratitude for Borrell’s role on the path of dialog and interaction. He criticized the diplomatically-impolite rhetoric of one or two European ministers, saying, “Today, some radical politicians in Europe hide behind the European Union and have the Union pay for them.” “This way, the European Union’s strategic goals have fallen victim to the greed of pro-violence and even terrorist groups, which give wrong information to these politicians,” he said. He said the European Union’s foreign policy chief has an important role in keeping the bloc away from unconstructive emotions. Elsewhere, the two sides discussed the latest situation of sanctions removal talks and cooperation between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Borrell highlighted his efforts to get all sides to the nuclear talks to return to the commitments undertaken in Vienna, saying he will continue his efforts and contacts toward facilitating the achievement of an agreement.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
