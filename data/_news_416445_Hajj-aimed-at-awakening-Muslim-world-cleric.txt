TEHRAN – The interim leader of the Tehran Friday prayer has urged the Islamic ummah to stand up for their rights, saying the purpose of the Hajj ritual was to awaken the Muslim world. “The hegemonic powers have Muslims’ blood on their hands and are seeking to divide Muslims and waste their energy,” Ayatollah Mohammed Emami-Kashani said on Friday while addressing Eid al-Adha prayers in the capital Tehran. It is the duty of the Islamic ummah to push their governments to resolve these issues, he added.
