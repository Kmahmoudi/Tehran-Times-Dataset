TEHRAN – Total has created a comprehensive database of Iranian contractors and equipment manufacturers to maximize the use of Iranian capacities in the development of phase 11 of Iran’s South Pars gas field, Shana reported on Wednesday quoting an oil official. According to Habibollah Bitaraf, the Iranian deputy oil minister for engineering, research and technology, the maximum contribution of Iranian contractors and equipment manufacturers in the South Pars project has been emphasized in the contract with Total, and the oil ministry and National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) are closely monitoring the process.
