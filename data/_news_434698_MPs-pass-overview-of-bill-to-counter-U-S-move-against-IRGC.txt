TEHRAN – The Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee on Sunday passed an overview of a bill to counter Washington’s move in calling the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) a terrorist organization.

  Ali Najafi Khoshrudi, the spokesman of the committee, said the double-urgency bill would in retaliation against the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and its subsidiary terrorist organizations. Any financial, technical, educational, and otherwise aid to the CENTCOM and its related bodies in West Asia would incur legal measures under Article 508 of the Islamic Penal Code, the lawmaker said. He said the bill would also require swift reaction to terrorist acts of U.S. forces which endanger the interests of the Islamic Republic. U.S. President Donald Trump labeled the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization last Monday. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the decision was an “election gift” to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was facing reelection a day later. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia welcomed the move by Trump.   Immediately after the announcement, the Iranian Supreme National Security Council named CENTCOM a terrorist organization, and the U.S. government a sponsor of terror. President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that the U.S. is aware of the consequences if it takes more steps than “slogans” against the IRGC. During a cabinet meeting, Rouhani said, “Prime minister of the Zionist regime of Israel has said clearly that the U.S. action has been taken upon their [the Israelis’] request. All the U.S. crimes and illegal actions have been in line with helping one person in the occupied lands to gain victory in election.” Last Tuesday all parliament members appeared on the Majlis floor wearing outfits of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps in a move to show contempt for the United States’ move to name the armed forces terrorist.
