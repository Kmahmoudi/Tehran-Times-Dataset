TEHRAN — Iran’s average precipitation has almost hit the normal levels since the beginning of the current water year (Sept. 22, 2016) up until April 2, director for drought and crisis management department of Iran’s Meteorological Organization said. Over the aforesaid period Iran got some 180.4 millimeters of rain while the long-term average precipitation levels are reported to be 183.8 millimeters and last year’s precipitation levels hit 184.2 millimeters, ISNA news agency quoted Shahrokh Fateh as saying. “Relatively speaking we are 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent short of long-term average precipitation and last year’s precipitation levels respectively,” Fateh said, stating, “despite the decrease we are almost in a normal condition.” “From the beginning of the current water year to Jan. 19 the situation was extremely worrying regarding precipitation level as we were 46 percent short of long-term average precipitation level and 60 percent below that of 2015-2016 water year,” Fateh noted. However, he continued, precipitations over the past three months have helped to ease the shortage to a great level.
