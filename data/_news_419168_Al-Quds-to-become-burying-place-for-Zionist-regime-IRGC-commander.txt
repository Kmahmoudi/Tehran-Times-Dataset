TEHRAN – Commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said on Saturday that al-Quds (Jerusalem) will become the burying place for the illegitimate Zionist entity, ISNA reported. “America and the Zionist regime committed their stupidest mistake yet,” Mohammad Ali Jafari said in reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of al-Quds as the capital of Israel. General Jafari called on all Muslims to oppose the move, which he described as a conspiracy to destroy al-Aqsa Mosque. He also said the Saudi regime is making sure Muslims’ stance against the U.S. new move remains limited to words and statements. MH/PA
