TEHRAN- Ebrahim Raisi, the President of Iran, has asserted that the world’s order is shifting in favor of the opposition front and against both the Israeli regime and global arrogance as well. The remarks were delivered by the Iranian president during a Sunday night phone call with his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad, as Israeli aggression against the downtrodden Palestinian people escalated. Raisi said that the world is shifting towards the resistance axis and against the Zionist regime and the arrogant system. He added, “The crimes of Israeli regime are a sign of its weakness and desperation and it is proof that the future is bright and promising for the resistance movement.” Raisi stressed the significance of upholding Syria’s national sovereignty and argued that doing otherwise will make it impossible to combat terrorism. For his part, Assad referred to 40 years of fight by Iran and Syria against common foes and said, “Today, the signs of collapse in the Zionist society have been revealed, which is the result of the resistance and especially the standing of the Palestinian nation.” Tensions have been high in the occupied territories since last week when dozens of heavily armed Israeli forces stormed the al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Then, before detaining the worshipers, Israeli police pummeled them with batons and riot arms, inflicting several injuries. The armed forces of the Tel Aviv regime launched a second assault against the Palestinian worshipers at the complex of al-Aqsa Mosque in less than 24 hours. More than 30 rockets were launched on Thursday from southern Lebanon towards the occupied territories in retaliation for Israeli attacks on al-Aqsa. The occupying regime also targeted Palestinian strongholds in Lebanon and Gaza. Iran calls for formation of united Muslim front against Israel In yet another phone call with his Algerian counterpart Abdelmadjid Tebboune on Sunday, Raisi underscored on the necessity for the Islamic Ummah to unify in opposition to the Zionist regime and support Palestinians unwaveringly. Additionally, he wished him and the nation’s revolutionary people a happy Ramadan. Raisi highlighted that “Iran and Algeria have close, shared positions on regional and international issues, particularly the issue of Palestine and the rights of the country’s oppressed people.” He regretted that the crimes committed by the Zionist regime against the Palestinian people have recently increased.  Today, it is more important than ever to form a “united front of Islamic countries” against the Zionist regime, the president suggested.  Raisi also expressed happiness with the two nations’ expanding ties and expressed optimism that Tehran and Algiers’ collaboration, particularly in the business and economic sectors, will continue to advance. For his part, President Tebboune wished the Iranian president and people a happy Ramadan and remarked, “The oppressed people of Palestine are suffering under the brutality of the Zionist regime during the holy month of Ramadan, and I pray that with the cooperation of Islamic nations, we can free the Palestinian nation from the Zionists' oppression.” The need for taking practical initiatives based on the roadmap for the advancement of mutual cooperation was again stressed by the two presidents.
