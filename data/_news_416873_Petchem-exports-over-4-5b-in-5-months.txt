TEHRAN- Iran exported over 9 million tons of petrochemical products worth $4.593 billion during the first five months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-August 22), IRNA reported on Sunday. As Shana news agency has previously quoted Ali-Mohammad Bossaqzadeh, the production control director of National Petrochemical Company (NPC), the country’s petrochemical output has risen five percent during the first five months of this year compared to the same time span in the preceding year. In July, Bossaqzadeh announced that seven new petrochemical projects were planned to be implemented in the country by the end of the current calendar year (March 20, 2018).
 
He put petrochemical output at 51 million tons in the past calendar year, saying that the figure is estimated to reach 56 million tons by the end of this year, posting a record for the second consecutive year. Iran is among the few countries which have all kinds of petrochemical feedstock, according to NPC Managing Director Marziyeh Shahdaie. The future of Iranian petrochemical industry is promising after the implementation of JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which lifted sanction against Iran in January 2016), Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said in the 13th edition of Iran Petrochemical Forum (IPF), which was held in Tehran on April 22. Given that Iran ranks the first and fourth in the world in terms of gas and oil reserves, respectively, no country enjoys feedstock as much as Iran to develop its petrochemical industry, Zanganeh highlighted.
