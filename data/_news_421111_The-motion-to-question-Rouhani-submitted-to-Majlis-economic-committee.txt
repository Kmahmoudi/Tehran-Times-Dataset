TEHRAN - The motion to ask questions from President Hassan Rouhani was submitted to the Majlis economic committee on Tuesday, Hassan Hosseini Shahroudi, a committee member, told Tasnim news agency on Wednesday.
 The MP said the questions center around finance and credit institutes, Hosseini Shahroudi said. The move to ask questions from the president would start after the Majlis finishes its study of the national budget bill, he said. The proceeding is that either the president himself attends the parliament to answer questions or he instead names a representatives to the committee members. If the MPs who have raised questions become convinced by the answers of the presidentâ€™s representative there would be no need for the president otherwise he himself should come to the Majlis and answer the questions. The plan to ask questions from the president has been signed by 76 MPs. PA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
