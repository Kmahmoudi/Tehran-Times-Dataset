TEHRAN – Iranian Judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani has called for a more concerted effort by Islamic countries in face of human rights atrocities committed by arrogant powers in a push to prevent their manipulative use of the issue.  Amoli Larijani made the comments in a meeting with Malaysia’s attorney general Mohamed Apandi Ali in Tehran on Tuesday. “Islamic countries should get to know their human rights ideas more and more and do not allow tyrannical powers to use human rights as a tool against them,” said the Judiciary chief.    “Unfortunately, the human rights issue has distanced from its humanistic essence and turned into a tool in the hands of powers.”  The Iranian official also lambasted arrogant powers for double standards on human rights, saying, “Sometimes arrogant powers will create hue and cry on the death of a human being but keep silent in face of the mass slaughtering of innocent people….”  Iran proposes joint judiciary committee with Malaysia  Elsewhere in his remarks, Amoli Larijani proposed the establishment of a joint judiciary committee with Malaysia for closer legal and judicial ties.
 
The committee will make it possible to carry out research projects on theoretical and political underpinnings of human rights, the Iranian official said.  Also, it will work toward reaching a common understanding of Islam and judicial principles against extremist readings and interpretations, he explained.   “Islamic countries can dialogue on human rights with each other from political and theoretical perspectives and these should not necessarily follow the political and human rights underpinnings of the West in connection with the human rights issue.”  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
