TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday that U.S. officials’ behavior shows hostility towards the Iranian people.
 Zarif was pointing to the visa ban against seven Muslim-majority countries including Iran by the Trump administration. On February 3, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart of Seattle, Washington, ruled in favor of a lawsuit seeking to overturn the President Donald Trump’s order. During a meeting with a number of Iranians living in states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, Zarif said that the Iranian people have proven that they resist threats. The Iranians are symbols of “perseverance” and “honesty”, he pointed out.  Zarif also said that Iran’s diplomatic missions in foreign countries are duty bound to defend the Iranian people’s rights and support the country’s experts and entrepreneurs in line with expanding economic and scientific cooperation. “Efforts should be within the framework of attracting investment, transferring technology and helping employment and improvement of the people’s living conditions,” he said.
