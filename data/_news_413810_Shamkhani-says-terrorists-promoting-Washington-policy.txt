Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani said on Thursday that “terrorists” sent by Riyadh to Syria and Iraq play into U.S. hand and are instruments that serve to promote Washington’s policy.

 “Iran has been fighting against terrorism for already 40 years… The U.S. citizens got to know what terrorism is after September 11, 2001. However, Trump made his first visit to the country which generates terrorists like a factory… Terrorists in Syria and Iraq are instruments that serve to promote Washington’s policy,” Sputnik quoted him as saying in an interview with Russia’s Kommersant newspaper. Shamkhani noted that public dissatisfaction with the hereditary transmission of power and Wahhabi ideology, among other issues, encouraged radicalization of young people in Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, he said that Iran will not agree on the participation of U.S. forces in guarding de-escalation zones in Syria. Syrian authorities do not want to see the “Americans supporting terrorism and destabilizing Syria”, he added. The security official said Iran is ready to consider a deployment of military troops for guarding the perimeter of the de-escalation zones. Iran, Turkey and Russia signed on May 4 a document on creating de-escalation zones in Syria. The document was signed at the end of the fourth round of the Syria peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan.
