TEHRAN - The relations between Iran and Malaysia, far from the arch lights of mainstream media, have always been steady.  In recent times, the friendship has grown strong with both countries signing bilateral agreements and vowing to enhance cooperation in areas of mutual concern. Last week, reaffirming Malaysia’s support to Iran, Malaysian deputy prime minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, in a meetingwith Iran’s vice president for women and family affairs Dr. Masoumeh Ebtekar, said Malaysia in principle supports Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, also known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Malaysia, the deputy prime minister said, believes that all states must adhere to the fundamental principles related to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and welcomes the JCPOA as an important development in efforts to promote peace, security and stability in the world. The official stance of Malaysia on Iran’s nuclear program has always been consistent. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Bin Mohamad, who was re-elected as the prime minister last month at the age of 92, once famously said that Iran has the right to make nuclear weapons. The two Muslim-majority countries have enhanced cooperation in trade and commerce in recent years. For 2017, according to a report published in Malaysia-based daily Malay Mail, bilateral trade between the two countries jumped by 61.2 percent to RM4.52 billion compared to RM2.81 billion in the previous year.  Total exports witnessed an increase of 50.4 per cent or RM3.25 billion compared to RM2.16 billion in 2016, while total imports increased 97.2 per cent to RM1.28 billion from RM0.64 billion in 2016. President Hassan Rouhani was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Prime Minister Matahir on his re-election last month. “I am confident that in your term of office, we will witness further development of relations between Tehran and Kuala Lumpur,” President Rouhani told him. The two leaders also discussed investment opportunities in Iran for Malaysian companies, pledging to enhance cooperation in political, economic and cultural spheres and portraying the real image of Islam to the world. Iran enjoys tremendous goodwill among people in Malaysia and the people of Malaysia have always supported Iran’s right to pursue nuclear program for energy purpose. In an article published in Malay Mail last week, the writer said Malaysia was just one of many countries used as a means for the U.S. to disseminate its anti-Iranian rhetoric. He said the two countries must defeat the sinister plots of the West and strengthen bilateral ties.  Clearly irked by the growing proximity between Tehran and Kuala Lumpur, the U.S. Treasury department earlier this month slapped a Malaysia-based travel company which has links with the Iranian airline Mahan Air with sanctions. Mahan Travel and Tourism was sanctioned as it enabled Mahan Air's international operations, especially for “conducting financial transactions on behalf of the airline,” the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.
