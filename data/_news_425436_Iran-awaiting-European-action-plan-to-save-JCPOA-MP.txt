TEHRAN - Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a member of the Parliament National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said on Sunday that Iran is waiting for a European action plan to save the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, now that Donald Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the agreement.
 “Any proposition to counter the U.S. sanctions cannot be useful if it is not practical. We are still waiting for Europe’s practical actions which would show that Europe has a thing to say to counter Trump’s U.S.,” Boroujerdi told Mehr News Agency. The entire world, excluding despots in Saudi Arabia and the UAE along with extremists in Israel, has expressed an unequivocal support for the preservation of the nuclear agreement without the United States.  The Joint Commission of the JCPOA met at the foreign ministerial level in Vienna on July 6. It was the first such meeting since the U.S. left the agreement. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who chaired the meeting, announced that Iran and the remaining parties to the nuclear agreement had agreed to continue negotiations, including on economic measures, over how to save the deal. Trump who announced the U.S. exit from the JCPOA on May 8 said sanctions will be restored against Iran.  According to the U.S. Treasury, the first stage of sanctions will be snapped back in August and the second stage in November. Trump has asked countries to cut their oil imports from Iran by November. Under the nuclear agreement approved by the UN Security Council, Iran is obliged to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of sanctions.
