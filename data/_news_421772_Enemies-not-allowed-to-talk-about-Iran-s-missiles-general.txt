TEHRAN – Ahmad Vahidi, president of the Supreme National Defense University of Iran, said on Sunday that the Islamic Republic will not allow the enemies to talk about its missile program. Vahidi also said the UK-drafted resolution against Iran at the UN Security Council, supported by the U.S., France and Germany, was intended to put pressure on Iran. The draft resolution, which claimed Iran had provided missiles to Yemen, was vetoed by Russia. Russia said allegations of missile delivery to Yemen is “uncorroborated”.   Vahidi said the resolution as well as the repeated calls for missile talks show that enemies are frightened by Tehran’s power.
