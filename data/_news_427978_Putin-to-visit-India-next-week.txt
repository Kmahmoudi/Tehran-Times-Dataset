TEHRAN - Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to visit India on October 4-5 for the 19th India-Russia annual bilateral summit, Indian government officially announced on Friday. Putin will hold the summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 5. He will also meet India’s newly-appointed President Ram Nath Kovind and other senior Indian leaders. During the much-anticipated visit of the Russian president, a number of agreements are expected to be signed between the two countries. There is also possibility of the two countries inking the much-anticipated S-400 Triumph missile defense system deal which could attract punitive action by the US under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). According to reports, India has already communicated to the U.S. to take into account the historic nature of India-Russia defense partnership and keep the missile deal out of the sanctions’ regime. The agenda of talks between Modi and Putin includes key aspects of special privileged partnership between their two countries. The two leaders are expected to review global developments, including the situation in Afghanistan and Syria, and implications of the U.S. withdrawal from Iranian nuclear deal. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had recently visited Moscow to prepare the ground for Putin’s visit to India. The last India-Russia summit was held in June 2017 when Modi visited St Petersburg. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
