Referring to Iran’s new applied policies for easing international ties and supporting foreign investments, he suggested that to become successful in Iran’s competitive market, Spanish companies are better to focus on modern ways of transferring knowledge to Iran as well as making joint investments and joint products with their Iranian counterparts to meet the demands of secondary markets.
