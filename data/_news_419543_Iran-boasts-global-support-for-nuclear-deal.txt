Gholamali Khoshroo, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, on Tuesday boasted the international community’s full support for the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 “The meeting of the Security Council today highlighted once again the international community’s full support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and further confirmed the importance of its full implementation,” he said in a press statement released after the UN Security Council's meeting held on Tuesday to review regular report on the Resolution 2231 related to the nuclear agreement. Following is full text of the statement published by IRNA: The meeting of the Security Council today highlighted once again the international community's full support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and further confirmed the importance of its full implementation.  The meeting was also a demonstration of the United States isolation with regard to the JCPOA.  The Permanent Representative of the United States made fabricated allegations against the Islamic Republic of Iran in the meeting. These baseless allegations come against the backdrop of U.S. hegemonic intentions in the Middle East region and its expansionist policies. The destructive interventions of the United States in region and the exporting of billions of dollars of sophisticated weaponry, some of which ended up in the hands of Daesh terrorist fighters, are among the actual sources of instability.  United States committed to 'make best efforts in good faith to sustain this JCPOA and to prevent interference with the realization of full benefits by Iran of the sanctions lifting'.  The statements of U.S. Representative with regard to the JCPOA are inconsistent with this commitment.  Meanwhile, the decision by the United States President [Donald Trump] regarding the JCPOA, announced on 13 October 2017, coupled with introduction of a set of new sanctions and irresponsible rhetoric in violation of its commitments under the JCPOA, pose an unprecedented risk to this important diplomatic achievement.  The international community should not allow the United States to continue to undermine the JCPOA.  It is reiterated that the Islamic Republic of Iran remains fully committed to the JCPOA, as confirmed by 9 consecutive IAEA reports and clearly stated in the four Secretary-General reports on the implementation of Security Council resolution 2231.
