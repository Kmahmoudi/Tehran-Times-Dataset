TEHRAN – The UNESCO-registered city of Yazd has been subject of extensive restoration and renovation projects in a bid to improve tourism standards in the central Iranian city.  “A budget of 35 billion rials (some $833,000) has been channeled into the projects, which are adding up to 14, and were commenced at the beginning of the current Iranian [calendar] year (March 21),” ISNA quoted Movahed Mirshamsi, a supervisor of urban developments at Yazd Municipality, as saying on Monday.  Rehabilitation of flooring textures, pedestrian paths, historical façades, passageways, and mud-brick structures are amongst projects, being mainly implemented in popular tourist spots and historical places, he added.  The oasis city of Yazd is wedged between the northern Dasht-e Kavir and southern Dasht-e Lut on a flat plain ringed by mountains. Its historical structure enjoys a very harmonious public-religious architecture that dates from different eras. With its winding lanes, forest of badgirs (wind catchers), mud-brick houses, atmospheric alleyways and centuries of history, Yazd is a delightful place to stay, referring as a ‘don't miss’ destination by almost all travel associates in the region. The city has an interesting mix of people as well, some 10 percent of whom follow the ancient religion of Zoroastrianism.
