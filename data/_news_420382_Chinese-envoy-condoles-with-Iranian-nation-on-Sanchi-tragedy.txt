TEHRAN – Chinese Ambassador to Iran Pang Sen expressed his deep condolences to the bereaved families of the victims of the Sanchi oil tanker which sank on Sunday, days after a collision with a Chinese freighter some 300 kilometers east of Shanghai. Carrying 136,000 tons of light crude oil from Iran, the Sanchi was destined for South Korea. It caught fire shortly after the collision and the entire crew of 30 Iranian and two Bangladeshi seafarers lost their lives.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
