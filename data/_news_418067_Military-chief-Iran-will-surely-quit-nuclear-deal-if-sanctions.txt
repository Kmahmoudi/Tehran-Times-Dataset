TEHRAN - Major General Mohammad Baqeri, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said on Monday that Iran will definitely quit the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) if sanctions return.
 “It is the Islamic Republic of Iran’s decision to accept some restrictions in the nuclear area to enjoy removal of nuclear-related sanctions, but if the sanctions return, it will make no sense to stay in the JCPOA,” he told a conference on passive defense. He noted that the JCPOA is a multilateral agreement which was achieved after months of diplomatic efforts and approved by the UN Security Council. Iran and the 5+1 group (the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia plus Germany) signed the nuclear agreement in July 2015.  On July 20, 2015, the UN Security Council turned the JCPOA into international law by endorsing a resolution, setting the stage for the lifting of the Security Council sanctions against Iran. Baqeri says Iran to reopen border crossing with Iraqi Kurdistan On the sidelines of the conference, Baqeri also told reporters that Iran will reopen border crossing with the Iraqi Kurdistan in upcoming days. Upon a request by the Iraqi government Iran closed its border with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) after Masoud Barzani pushed ahead with the independence referendum on September 25.
  
Baghdad described the voting as “illegal”.  Kurdish leaders offered to freeze the referendum results and start dialogue with the central government in Baghdad, but Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi rejected that offer. Abadi said he would accept only an annulment of the referendum and respect for the country's constitution. On Sunday, Barzani announced in a letter that he would not seek an extension to his presidential term, which ends in four days.
