TEHRAN – China’s private sector is eager to meet its energy needs through Iranian energy resources, Shana quoted the head of China International Chamber of Commerce for the Private Sector as saying on Tuesday. Wang Yanguo made the remarks in a meeting with Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh in Tehran. “China has a shortage of energy resources, while Iran, our old friend, has rich oil and gas reserves, which can help expand relations between the two countries,” Yanguo said. Zanganeh, for his part, said the two countries have the potential to boost cooperation in private investments as well as oil and petrochemical projects. China is the main buyer of Iranian crude oil. Chinese imports from Iran in September rose nearly 60 percent from a year ago to about 784,000 barrels per day, down from August when China imported the highest monthly amount since 2006, according to a Reuters report.  EF/MG Photo Caption: Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh (R) receives a gift from Wang Yanguo, head of China International Chamber of Commerce for the Private Sector, on the sidelines of a meeting in Tehran on Tuesday.
