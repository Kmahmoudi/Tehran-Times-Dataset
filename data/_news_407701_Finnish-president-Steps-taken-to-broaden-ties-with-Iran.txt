TEHRAN - Visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said on Tuesday that his visit to Tehran will provide a unique opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest, including what is happening in the Middle East region. The Finnish president made the comments while speaking to Finnish and Iranian business representatives in Tehran.   “The purpose of my visit is to discuss current issues in international politics and developments in the Middle East,” the president remarked.  President Niinistö also underscored the importance of his visit to Tehran for economic cooperation between the two sides in the future.  “My visit is also a wonderful opportunity to strengthen our bilateral relations, to explore new opportunities for economic cooperation and to enhance collaboration between Finnish and Iranian companies.”  To achieve the goal, concrete, forward-looking steps have already been taken to broaden ties with Iran after the nuclear deal, he highlighted.
 
“During the year gone by, we have taken steps forward in broadening our relations and have made many high-level visits.” The nuclear deal finalized between Iran and world powers in 2015 paved the way for the two countries to resume ties, the Finnish head of state reminded.  “The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) completed in July 2015 was an important milestone, which opened up new opportunities in our bilateral relations and business cooperation.”  Hailing Iran as “an economically and politically important country in a strategically important region,” the president listed a number of areas to focus on for better future relations between Iran and Finland.  “We believe that Finland can offer first class expertise and know-how in many sectors in which there is now demand in Iran. These include cleantech and energy efficiency, bioeconomy, and the forest sector, mining, ICI, construction and health.” “I am confident that this visit will broaden our economic cooperation and provide opportunities to enhance our bilateral relations,” the Finnish president concluded.  AK/PA
