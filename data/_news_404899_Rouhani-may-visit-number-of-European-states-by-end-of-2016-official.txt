TEHRAN – The deputy foreign minister for European and American affairs has said that President Hassan Rouhani may visit a number of the European countries by the end of 2016.
 A number of the European countries such as Germany and Austria have invited Rouhani and the trips may take place by the end of the current year, Majid Takht-Ravanchi told ISNA in an interview published on Tuesday. He added that a number of high ranking European delegations plan to visit Iran.  The exact date of the trips will be announced in future, he said. The deputy minister also said Ireland and Slovenia seek to reopen embassies in Tehran. The consular and commercial sections of the European countries in Iran are being activated due to an increase in exchange of visits by the Iranian and European delegations, he stated. Elsewhere, Takht-Ravanchi said that it is essential for the European Union to open an office in Tehran as a new chapter has opened in relations between Iran and European countries. He said currently two representatives on behalf of the EU are following the issue of opening the EU office in Tehran, however, it will take time. Commenting on relations with Canada, he said that Iran is ready to bring the ties back to the previous state if the Canadian government distances itself from “hostile” actions against Iran. He also said that no change has been made in order to promote Iran-Britain’s ties beyond the level of charge d’affaires. Terrorism not restricted to Middle East Takht-Ravanchi also said that terrorism and extremism are not restricted to the Middle East region and other countries in other parts of the world have been affected.  He said that dividing terrorism into “good terrorism” and “bad terrorism” is a blunder, calling for avoiding double standards in this respect.
