TERAHN – Iran and Indonesia plan to share and exchange science and technology in use of space technology in the near future, Mehr reported on Monday. Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) chairman Thomas Djamaluddin and Iranian Space Agency (ISA) Director Morteza Barari discussed expansion of relationship during a meeting on the sidelines of 61st Committee of the United Nations on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which is currently underway in Vienna, Austria. At the meeting, Iran and Indonesia signed an agreement on development of space industry use and services. ISA suggests strengthening scientific and technology ties with other countries in the field of space technology, Barari said.  He said that both Iran and Indonesia are geographically located inside direct physical threats from natural hazards. “Hence, space technology would be a great help in controlling natural disasters,” he said. Barari proposed holding workshops and mutual events to share scientific achievements of two countries. ISA also aims to develop scientific and technological exchanges which lead to support of Iranian space-based market, he concluded. COPUOS, which runs until June 29, aims to review the scope of international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space, to devise programs in this field to be undertaken under United Nations auspices, to encourage continued research and the dissemination of information on outer space matters, and to study legal problems arising from the exploration of outer space.
