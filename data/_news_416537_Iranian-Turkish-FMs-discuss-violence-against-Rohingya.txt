TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu have exchanged views about the ongoing violence targeting the persecuted Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar’s troubled Rakhine State. In a phone conversation on Monday, the two sides talked about possible measures to help the Rohingya. The violence erupted in Myanmar’s Rakhine state on August 25 when government forces launched attacks against the Rohingya Muslim community. Ever since, tens of thousands of the Muslim minority fled to Bangladesh. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
