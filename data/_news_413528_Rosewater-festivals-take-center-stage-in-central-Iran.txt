Harvesting and distillation Rosewater is obtained from a very sweet smelling kind of the flowers, best known as Mohammadi roses in the country. Rosewater and rose oil are major products of the damask rose. Harvesting damask rose flowers is somewhat an intensive work. It is mostly performed from dawn through morning.  Delay in harvesting or transport to distillery results in decreased essential oil quantity and quality.   To extract the rosewater people first amass their petals to put them into the massive copper pots. Then the pots are put on traditional ovens made from bricks, stones and mud. Almost every 30 Kg of rose petals plus 80 liters of water are poured into each pot that is connected to metal pipes for the steam moving through to obtain the hydrosol. The waste of distillation is used for feeding livestock or composting.   Visitors buy rosewater and other herbal drinks displayed on the shelves of shop in Kashan on May 3, 2017.
