TEHRAN – A total of 18 eco-lodges have been constructed across the central Yazd province from the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21, 2018), CHTN reported. “These units have been built with the aim of experiencing traditional life, preserving historical houses and enriching [domestic] life in historical sites and villages,” Mohammad Mirshamsi, a local tourism official, said. The eco-lodges have been built in various areas including Ardakan, Meybod, Mehriz, Ashkezar, Abarkouh, and Yazd [the capital of Yazd province], he explained. Mirshamsi, however, didn’t provide any information on the number of eco-lodge units in the province. In the field of employment, the eco-lodges have provided 50 job opportunities for 50 people, the official added. According to the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, 2,000 eco-lodges will be added to Iran’s hospitality sector in a span of three years starting from 2018. Having a very diverse natural setting, Iran offers varied excursions to nature lovers. Sightseers may live with a nomad or rural family or enjoy an independent stay.
