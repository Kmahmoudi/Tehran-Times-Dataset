TEHRAN – New Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi announced on Monday that his country will make efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan. “The military defeat and pullout of the U.S. from Afghanistan must be turned into an opportunity to revive life, security and sustainable pace in the country,” Raisi said in talks with outgoing Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The comments by President Raisi comes as the Taliban took control of the capital Kabul and the presidential palace on Sunday. Raisi, whose cabinet has not still been formed, said “stability and welfare” is the right of the Afghan people. “Iran will make efforts for the stability of Afghanistan as today’s first need, and as a neighboring and brotherly country invites all groups to agree on a national consensus,” Raisi remarked. President Raisi said Iran believes that the will of the “oppressed people of Afghanistan” has always been based on promoting security and stability. He added that Iran will closely monitor developments in Afghanistan and that the Islamic Republic is committed to good neighborliness. The new president also tasked the foreign minister and the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) to closely monitor developments in Afghanistan and brief him. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Zarif advised rival Afghan sides that like occupation, violence and war will never help settle the long-running conflict in Afghanistan and expresses hope for a “peaceful transition” of power in the country. “Violence & war—like occupation—never solve problems,” Zarif tweeted. A transitional committee has been formed to hand over power to the Taliban in a peaceful way. The transitional committee is mostly led by former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the government’s lead negotiator with the Taliban. Zarif said, “Iran welcomes announcement by @KarzaiH on forming a Coordination Council by Afghan leaders. We hope that it can lead to dialogue & a peaceful transition in Afghanistan.” Zarif reiterated that “Iran stands ready to continue its peacemaking efforts” in Afghanistan.
