TEHRAN- Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan announced on Sunday that Iran has held no talks with Russia and China over buying aircrafts from them, IRNA reported. He, in addition, said that Iran has forgone plans to buy Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), a twin-engine regional jet aircraft seating 70â€“90 passengers, from the Japanese company. He explained that Iran has ditched the plan because the Japanese airplane manufacturer cannot set a deadline for delivering the ordered planes and because MRJ planes have not been fully tested by the manufacturer. The unit of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries began market surveys into Iran in September 2015, four months before the U.S. lifted sanctions. The Japanese company had been touching base with flag carrier Iran Air and Iran Aseman Airlines, as well as the country's aviation authorities. itsubishi Aircraft and the Iranian carriers discussed purchase orders during the Farnborough Air Show, which kicked off on in July 2016 in the London suburb. Iran Air was weighing to purchase 80 70-seat Mitsubishi Regional Jets and using them for domestic routes.
