TEHRAN – Officers in all of Iran’s police stations are being equipped with body cameras, a commander said on Monday, Tasnim reported. General Mohammad Sharafi, commander of an Iranian police department tasked with prevention of crimes, said the process of equipping police officers with body worn videos (BWV) will be finished by the end of summer. Mounted onto the officers’ uniform, the body cameras record footages during the operations which can be monitored online from a central department. Police officials say evaluation of footage from the body cameras would help optimize operational tactics in dealing with crimes.
