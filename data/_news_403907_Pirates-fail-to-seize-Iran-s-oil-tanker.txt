TEHRAN â€“ An Iranian squadron prevented 12 boats carrying 115 armed pirates from seizing an Iranian oil tanker around the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. The pirates sought to attack the oil tanker, but were forced to flee while facing Martyr Naqdi destroyer. The Iranian Navy 41th squadron, comprising Martyr Naqdi destroyer and Lavan cruiser, escorted the oil tanker to a safe place after repelling the attack. The Iranian Navy has been conducting anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden since November 2008 to safeguard the vessels involved in maritime trade, especially the ships and oil tankers owned or leased by Iran.
