TEHRAN – A top adviser to the Supreme Leader said on Monday that Iran’s support for Syrian government will continue until a final victory is achieved, IRNA reported. “We strongly support the Syrian government and President Bashar al-Assad,” said Ali Akbar Velayati in a meeting with Syrian Parliament Speaker Hadiya Khalaf Abbas in Tehran. He stressed that Tehran and Damascus share common views on the Syrian conflict and have been expanding their strategic relations since the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. The top official noted that the two sides have been improving their mutual relations and have managed to overcome many difficulties together. “Some 80 countries, most of which being Western states and reactionary Arab countries in the region” have been fanning the flames in Syria since the crisis broke out in 2011, however, they paid a big price for their action, he stated. Since the Syrian government and nation have been standing against the Zionist regime these countries inflicted great losses on the country, Velayati added. He also emphasized that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Leader of the Islamic Revolution, has put the issue of supporting Syria on Iran’s plan of action and that the government has also provided the necessary support in this regard.
