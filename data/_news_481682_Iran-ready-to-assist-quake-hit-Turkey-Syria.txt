The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported that the earthquake, which occurred at a depth of 24.1 kilometers and struck 23 kilometers east of Nurdagi in Turkey's Gaziantep province, is one of the greatest to have impacted the region in more than 100 years. Patients are overflowing the hallways of Syria’s northwest hospitals. According to officials, about 1,000 search and rescue volunteers have been sent from Istanbul to southern Turkey. The rescue attempts are anticipated to be hampered by bad weather, including snow and below-freezing temperatures, when a cold and rainy weather system passes across the region. The low temperature on Tuesday is predicted to be -6 degrees Celsius in Gaziantep. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
