He underlined the potentials and capabilities of Iran’s ceramic and tile industry, saying that the country’s ceramic and tile exports in the Iranian calendar year of 1397 (ended on March 20, 2019) increased by 10 percent compared to its preceding year. Roshanfekr put the country’s ceramic and tile production during the Iranian calendar year of 1397 at about 400 million cubic meters.
