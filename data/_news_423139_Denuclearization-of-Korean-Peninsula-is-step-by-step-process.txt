"The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place," he added. What will the impact of this historic summit on the decision of Trump on JCPOA? A: I am very worried that, despite all the advice he has been receiving from experts and leaders in the U.S. and from abroad, President Trump will refuse to continue the suspension of sanctions on Iran that the United States agreed to under the JCPOA.  I hope I will be pleasantly surprised.  If President Trump realizes our worst fears, however, I hope that Iran will not over-react and make the situation more dangerous.  President Trump’s power to do such damage should be reduced after this year’s election.  Most Americans appear to be alarmed by his arbitrary and capricious actions in many areas – not just his actions on the JCPOA.
