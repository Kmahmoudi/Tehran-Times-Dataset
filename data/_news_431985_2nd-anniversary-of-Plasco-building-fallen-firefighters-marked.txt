TEHRAN — The second death anniversary of the firefighters who were killed in Plasco building collapse was held in Tehran on Friday. 
 On January 19, 2017, the 17-stroey Plasco building, a shopping center in downtown Tehran, caught fire and smashed to the ground after hours of effort to put out the fire. Sadly some 16 firefighters got trapped under the building and it took almost 9 days to clear through debris to find the bodies. The anniversary was held in Tehran cemetery, known as Behesht-e Zahra, with the presence of firefighters and their family members.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
