TEHRAN – A senior political analyst believes that Israel is trying to provoke Iran by its repeated attacks against Syrian bases which are in turn killing Iranian forces. The Israelis are seeking Iran’s reaction so that they could start an extensive conflict in Syria, Davod Hermidas-Bavand, a politics professor, told ILNA on Monday. Pointing to the Zionist regime’s air raids on Syria, he said the Syrian government and its allies have the right to file a complaint about the aggression to the UN Security Council. He also called on Iranian officials to act wisely in response to the developments in Syria and avoid giving an excuse to Israel for creating tension between the sides in Syria. “Israeli officials have already declared their dissatisfaction about Iran’s presence in Syria,” the professor said, adding, “This is while Iran’s presence in Syria is due to the official request of the Syrian government.” The professor went on to say that Iran is fighting Daesh (ISIL) and other terrorist groups in Syria and has sacrificed so much in this path. The Syrian army said on Sunday that rockets had struck several military bases in the Hama and Aleppo countryside. Syrian state television said the missile attacks took place at 10:30 p.m. Later reports by some media outlets suggested that the missile attack had targeted what they called Iranian military bases and that Iranians were killed as a result. However, Iran denied attack on its military advisors in Syria. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
