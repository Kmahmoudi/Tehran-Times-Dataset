The Pakistani leader, who is due to meet King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, was greeted at the Riyadh air base by the capital's Governor Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz, a diplomatic source said. The Foreign Ministry in Islamabad said Monday that Musharraf's talks with Saudi leaders would focus on the Middle East, India-Pakistan relations and bilateral ties. Musharraf also plans to perform omrah, the Muslim lesser pilgrimage, to the city of Mecca, Islam's holiest site. The Pakistani leader's trip had originally been due to start on Monday. No reason was given for the delay, AFP reported. Musharraf visited Saudi Arabia in June for talks with Crown Prince Abdullah, the kingdom's de facto ruler, when military tensions between archrivals Pakistan and India soared to dangerous levels. Senior envoys from India also visited the kingdom in the past few months to appraise Saudi leaders of developments.
