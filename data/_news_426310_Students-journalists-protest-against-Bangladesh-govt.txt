Journalists in Bangladesh have gave a 72-hour ultimatum to the Sheikh Hasina government to arrest miscreants responsible for attacks on media persons while covering the protests by students over road safety, according to media reports. Thousands of students brought Dhaka to a standstill after two teenagers were killed by a speeding bus on 29 July. A large number of journalists and photojournalists also gathered in front of the Jatiya Press Club in Dhaka on Tuesday morning and formed a human chain in protest against the attacks, Bangladeshi newspaper Daily Star reported reported. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina warned on Sunday that a “third party” could sabotage the protests and put the safety of demonstrators at risk. “That’s why I request all guardians and parents to keep their children at home. Whatever they have done is enough,” she said. Human Rights Watch, a global rights watchdog, condemned the government action against the protestors and journalists covering the protest. “Instead of prosecuting those responsible for unlawfully attacking student protesters demanding road safety, Bangladesh authorities are arresting students and targeting activists and journalists who are highlighting the abuses,” it said in a statement on Tuesday. Authorities should order an immediate investigation into reports that renowned photographer and activist, Shahidul Alam, was beaten while in custody, the statement added.
