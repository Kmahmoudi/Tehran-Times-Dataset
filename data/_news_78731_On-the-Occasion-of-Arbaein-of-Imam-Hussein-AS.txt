"If the Message of Mohammad (S) can not survive except by my being killed, then, O' swords, come and here I am." What a profound sense of devotion and sacrifice and determination to lay down his life for the noble cause of saving Islam. Only one absolutely certain of divine approval of his stand and ultimate justice in the afterlife would utter such words and welcome martyrdom. On the eve of his martyrdom, the Imam (AS) delivered a sermon in which he told his followers: "Allegiance to the oppressor (Yazid) is impossible. Whoever wants to go away can do so, and whoever wants to die with me can stay behind. Because I do not see in death anything but salvation and in living under oppressors nothing but humiliation and disgrace." That life of true dignity is inherent in the absolute steadfastness on the noble principles of Islam and not in compromise nor bowing down before an oppressive ruler, even though such a struggle for justice may require the greatest of sacrifices. Standing before the army of Yazid on the day of Ashura, the Imam (AS) said these words: "If you do not follow any religion and are not afraid of the day of resurrection, then at least be freeminded in life." (conscious of their choice as free men to decide not to support oppression). It was the afternoon of Ashura when all the companions and kith and kin of Imam Hussein (AS) lay martyred with their bloodstained bodies on the burning sands of Karbala. Imam Hussein (AS) was left all alone and his heart was drawn and intensely attached to Allah. Towards the sky he suddenly raised his head and in supplication to the Lord, he uttered the following memorable words: "O' my Lord I have given up all without exception out of my love for Thee and abandoned all my family. I have also accepted the orphaning of my children in order to meet Thee. If out of love for Thee, my body were chopped into pieces, even then my heart would not bow before any one but Thee." It was under extreme afflictions that the Imam (AS) showed his undaunted faith and love for Allah, which is unparalleled in the history of mankind.
