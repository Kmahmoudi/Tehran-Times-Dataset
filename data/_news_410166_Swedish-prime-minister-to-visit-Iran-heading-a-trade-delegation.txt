Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven will visit Iran at the invitation of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. 
 A business delegation, including representatives of a large number of Swedish companies and government agencies, will also be travelling to Iran.  The delegation, led by Minister for EU Affairs and Trade Ann Linde, is part of the Government’s Team Sweden initiative and export strategy to promote increased Swedish presence in growth markets. 
Historically, Iran has been one of Sweden’s most important export markets in the Middle East and several Swedish companies have long had a presence in the country.
Iran is an important political and economic actor with a key role in the region. Developments in the Middle East increasingly affect both Europe and Sweden. The Prime Minister has therefore travelled extensively in the region and spoken with the major stakeholders. (Source: government.se)
