TEHRAN – British ambassador to Tehran Nicholas Hopton has described the 4th Europe-Iran Forum as constructive, saying participation from Iran, Europe and other parties in the forum was satisfactory, IRNA reported on Saturday. The important thing is that it proved the Iran nuclear deal brings people together and that some efforts are underway, said Hopton, speaking to IRNA’s correspondent on the sidelines of the event in Zurich. He also voiced support for the full implementation of the nuclear agreement, saying all sides should comply with it.
