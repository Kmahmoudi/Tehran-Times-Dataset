TEHRAN – A member of the Combatant Clergy Association has said reformists will get heavily involved in the upcoming city council elections. In an interview posted on the ISNA website on Saturday, Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said reformists have concentrated their efforts on council elections and they are likely to secure enough votes in most regions. “Fortunately, the candidates and the reformist movement are in good shape,” Mousavi Lari said. “However,” he added, “this will depend on the atmosphere of [council] elections as well as presidential election.” MH/PA
