TEHRAN - Taking their partnership to the next level, India, Iran and Afghanistan held their first tripartite meeting on Tuesday in Kabul during which implementation of the strategic Chabahar port project and a host of other issues were discussed, according to reports. The Iranian team was headed by deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, while the Indian delegation was led by foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale. Afghan deputy foreign minister Hekmat Khalil Karzai chaired the meeting. “The meeting focused on consolidating economic cooperation, including Chabahar, as well as enhancing cooperation on counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and continuing support to the peace and reconciliation process that is led and owned by Afghanistan,” the three participating countries said in a joint-statement. According to reports, the possible impact of the U.S. sanctions on the Chabahar project figured prominently in the discussions. All sides reaffirmed their commitment to continue the project, which will bring Afghanistan closer to India and Central Asia, and reduce its heavy dependence on Pakistan. The Chabahar port in Sistan-Baluchistan province of Iran is being considered a gateway to golden opportunities for trade by the three countries with central Asian countries. The joint statement added that the three parties had agreed to hold the next round of consultation at an appropriate time in India next year.
