TEHRAN - In a direct rebuke to the Donald Trump administration, Pakistan’s Prime Minister-in-waiting Imran Khan has thrown his weight behind Turkey, which is currently experiencing rocky relations with Washington. Khan, who will be sworn in as the new premier of Pakistan this week, has expressed support for Turkey amid its financial difficulties, increasing U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Turkey’s Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and Justice Minister Abdülhamit Gül for not releasing American Pastor Andrew Brunson, who faces terrorism charges in Turkey. “On behalf of the people of Pakistan & myself, I want to let President Erdogan & the people of Turkey know we are praying for their success in dealing with the severe economic challenges confronting them, as they have always succeeded against adversities in their glorious history,” Khan wrote on Twitter. His remarks came several days after U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up his attack on Turkey by increasing U.S. tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel imports to 20 percent and 50 percent, respectively. On Monday, in a statement, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry also opposed the “unilateral sanctions” imposed by the U.S. on Turkey over the detention of an American pastor under terrorism charges. “Pakistan, in principle, is opposed to imposition of unilateral sanctions against any country. The solution to any and all issues should lie in dialogue, mutual understanding and goodwill,” the statement by Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said.
