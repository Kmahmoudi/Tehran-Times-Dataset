TEHRAN- Some 14,300 kilometers of roads are under construction in Iran, the managing director of Construction and Development of Transportation Infrastructures Company announced in a news conference on Tuesday.

“More than 70,000 workers are constructing these roads,” he said. “Construction of 41,000 kilometers of roads requires 1.4 quadrillion rials (about $30.2 billion) funds, while the government can supply 50 trillion rials (about $1.08 billion) and the private sector can provide 20 trillion rials (about $432 million) of the said amount per year,” he lamented, “construction of 41,000 kilometers of roads will take about 20 years in Iran”.
