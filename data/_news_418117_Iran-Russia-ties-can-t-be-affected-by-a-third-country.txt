TEHRAN - Mohsen Pakaeen, the former Iranian ambassador to Azerbaijan, said on Wednesday that relations between Iran and Russia have become so strong that cannot be influenced by a third country.
 “The future of relations between Iran and Russia is bright and Putin’s visit to Iran will result in boosting ties, and any effort by a country to negatively influence relations will fail,” he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Iran on Wednesday to attend trilateral meeting of Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia.
