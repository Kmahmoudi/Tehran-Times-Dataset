TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has rejected repeated anti-Iran accusations, saying the countries which accuse Iran are repeating their past mistakes. In a statement on Wednesday, Qassemi pointed to Saudi Arabia and Egypt’s joint statement, saying labeling Iran as a threat will lead to nothing but backwardness, divergence and exploitation by the enemies. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has always prioritized its neighbors in its foreign policy, and has tried, in one way or another, to help resolve regional disputes and boost convergence and establish security in the region,” he said. He also said Iran has no weapons in Yemen, while Saudi Arabia uses French weapons to wage its aggression against Yemen.
