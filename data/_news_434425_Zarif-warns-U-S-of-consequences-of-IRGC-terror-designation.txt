TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned the U.S. on Sunday of the consequences of designating the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization, saying President Donald Trump “should know better than to be conned into another U.S. disaster.” “#NetanyahuFirsters who have long agitated for FTO designation of the IRGC fully understand its consequences for US forces in the region. In fact, they seek to drag US into a quagmire on his behalf,” Zarif said in a tweet. “@realDonaldTrump should know better than to be conned into another US disaster,” he added.
