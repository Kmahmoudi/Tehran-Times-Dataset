TEHRAN- President Ebrahim Raisi has said there exits a significant potential for relationship between Tehran and Kuala Lumpur in a variety of areas, stating that Tehran sees Malaysia as an important country in Asia and the larger Muslim world. Raisi made the remarks in a phone conversation on Friday with Anwar Ibrahim, the newly-elected prime minister of Malaysia. "Iran and Malaysia have great and diverse capabilities in the fields of economy, technology, culture, and international cooperation. Serious efforts by the two countries' officials can actualize these capabilities in accordance with the interests of the two nations," the Iranian president remarked. For his part, Anwar stated that there is a significant potential for Iran and Malaysia to strengthen relationship in the cultural and business spheres "We will do our utmost to raise our relations as two countries and great Islamic nations to the greatest extent possible," the Malaysian leader remarked. Following tumultuous parliamentary elections that resulted in a hung parliament, Malaysia's monarch named Ibrahim as prime minister on Thursday, putting an end to days of uncertainty. The 75-year-old Anwar has time and again been denied the premiership despite getting within striking distance over the years. He was deputy prime minister in the 1990s and the official prime minister-in-waiting in 2018.
