TEHRAN – The parliament would never allow anyone to hold talks about the country’s missile power, the spokesman of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Majlis has said, Tasnim reported on Tuesday. Hossein Naqavi Hosseini said although there are some differences of opinion among political groups in the parliament, there is a consensus among the lawmakers about issues pertaining to national interests, including the country’s defense power. The remarks came as French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who visited Tehran on Monday, threatened ahead of his trip that Iran needed to address international concerns over its ballistic missile program or it risked new sanctions.
