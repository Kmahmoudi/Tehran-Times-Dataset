TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi attended a regular biweekly press conference on Monday in Tehran, where he fielded a number of questions on a wide specter of regional and international issues. On sticking points in the second round of Syrian talks in Astana, the spokesman said “we are in the best conditions of cooperation, consultation and understanding with Russia. There is no disagreement with Russia about the issues to be included in the agenda for Astana to summit at this stage”. He also rejected that there had been any contact between Iran and the Trump administration. “There is no relationship with the new U.S. government or the U.S. President’s advisors or others and we state this quite clearly.” AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
