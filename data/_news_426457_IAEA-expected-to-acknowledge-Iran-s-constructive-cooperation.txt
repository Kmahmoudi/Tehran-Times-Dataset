TEHRAN – The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is expected to reconfirm Iran’s compliance with its obligations under the 2015 nuclear agreement and acknowledge its “constructive cooperation” with the IAEA, the chair of the IAEA Board of Governors Darmansjah Djumala has said. Djumala made the remarks in a meeting with Kazem Gharib Abadi, Iran’s representative to the Vienna-based international organizations, ILNA reported on Sunday. Since the implementation of the nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the IAEA has confirmed Iran’s full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA in 11 reports. However on May 8 U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Washington was walking away from the JCPOA, signed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany in 2015, and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran.  Gharib Abadi said despite the Trump administration’s illegal withdrawal from the JCPOA, the Islamic Republic has decided to give a second chance to multilateral efforts, including cooperation with the IAEA, so long as the other sides to the deal would remain committed to their obligations. The Iranian diplomat further urged the IAEA to keep its “political independence” in the face of U.S. pressure. The two sides also stressed the importance of multilateralism with regard to international agreements, and criticized the U.S. government under Trump for its unilateral policies. Washington’s behavior is contrary to the spirit of international relations, they added.
