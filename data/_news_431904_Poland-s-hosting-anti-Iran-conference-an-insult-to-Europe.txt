TEHRAN - Kamal Kharrazi, head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, said on Tuesday that Poland’s action in hosting a U.S.-led anti-Iran conference is an insult to the Europeans’ identity.
 “The U.S. is taking Poland’s national interests hostage by holding this political show and this action of Poland is an insult to the European identity and European nations,” he said during a meeting with a Norwegian academic delegation. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News in an interview aired on Friday that Washington will jointly host a global summit focused on Iran and the Middle East next month in Poland. The gathering will take place in Warsaw from February 13 to 14, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Pompeo said the meeting would “focus on Middle East stability and peace, freedom and security here in this region, and that includes an important element of making sure that Iran is not a destabilizing influence”. The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday summoned Polish charge d’affaires to Tehran to protest Poland’s bid to co-host an anti-Iran conference in Warsaw.
