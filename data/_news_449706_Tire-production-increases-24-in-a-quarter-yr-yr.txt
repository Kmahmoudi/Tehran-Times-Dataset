TEHRAN- Production of tire in Iran has risen 24 percent during the first quarter of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-June 20) compared to the same period of time in the past year, IRNA reported. As reported, 67,734 tons of tires have been produced in the country during the first quarter. Of the mentioned figure, 36,512 tons were the passenger car tires, which shows a 30-percent rise compared to the first quarter of the past year. Some 5,476 tons of van tires were manufactured, indicating a ten-percent growth from the figure of the previous year’s first quarter. Also, 12,825 bus tires were manufactured, showing an eight percent rise.  Manufacturing of the tires of agricultural machinery experienced a growth of 49 percent to stand at 5,754 tons. Meanwhile, 1,513 tons of road building machinery tires were manufactured, with a 21-percent growth compared to the first quarter of the past year. In terms of number, a 27-percent growth was also experienced in tire output during the first quarter of the year, as 10.525 million tires of different types were produced in the three-month period. Having the annual production capacity of 426,000 tons of tire, Iran accounts for 41 percent of tire output in the West Asian region, according to the deputy director of the non-metal industries office of the Iranian Industry, Mining, and Trade Ministry. Mohsen Safdari has said that 11 tire production units are active in the country creating jobs for 14,500 people. He said 426,000 tons is the nominal capacity, while the real output is less than this figure as some units are working with 60-70 percent of their capacity. “Iranian tire industry is dependent on foreign raw materials by 40 percent, so we are self-reliant by 60 percent in this field”, the official announced. In a bid to nullify the U.S. sanctions, Iran is determined to strengthen its domestic production to achieve self-reliance. Selecting the motto of “Pickup in Production” for the previous Iranian calendar year (March 2019-March 2020), and the slogan of “Surge in Production” for the current year indicates the Islamic Republic’s determination to achieve this goal. To this end, the Iranian ministries besides the private sector have been outlining their programs for the surge in production. Industry, Mining and Trade Ministry has announced some seven main axes of the surge in production that are going to be pursued under 40 major programs. Developing technology and promoting knowledge-based industries, development of domestic production in line with the Leader’s stresses on surge in production, managing imports and development of non-oil exports, improving the business environment, development of financing and investment and finally development of logistics were reported to be the seven major axes of the Industry, Mining and Trade Ministry’s works in the current year, which is named “Surge in Production” by the Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei.  MA/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
