The 2015 nuclear deal between the United States, Iran and other world powers has benefited U.S. national security, a group of 38 retired U.S. generals and admirals wrote in an open letter to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Sputnik reported. The former U.S. military officers wrote the letter to mark the two-year anniversary of the nuclear deal officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The agreement was concluded on 14 July, 2015 between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and China. "The international accord... has greatly strengthened the security of the United States and our allies," the letter stated. The officers also urged Trump to establish diplomatic channels with Tehran to ensure the continued implementation of the deal and "resolve national security crises" that may occur. Under the terms of the deal, nuclear-related sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for assurances Tehran’s nuclear program would remain peaceful. In the letter, the military officers noted that Iran has complied with its obligations under the JCPOA by dismantling two-thirds of its centrifuges, surrendering 98 percent of its stockpiled uranium and destroying the core of its heavy water reactor. The officers also urged Trump to establish diplomatic channels with Tehran to ensure the continued implementation of the deal and "resolve national security crises" that may occur. Trump and Republicans in Congress have criticized the JCPOA, with Trump decrying it as one of the worst deals in history. Trump has not followed through with his promise to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement, but the administration is currently reviewing whether lifting sanctions on Iran is in the interest of U.S. national security. Trump has repeatedly slammed the Iranian nuclear deal and calling it disastrous for Israel.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
