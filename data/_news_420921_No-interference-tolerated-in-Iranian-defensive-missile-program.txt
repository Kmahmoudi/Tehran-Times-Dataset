TEHRAN – Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said at Tehran Friday prayers that the U.S. is seeking to reduce Iran’s missile capabilities to appease the Zionist regime but Iran will continue with its missile program within the framework of its defense strategy. Ayatollah Khatami said Iran will not negotiate with any country over its defense capabilities, and will continue strengthening its defensive missile power, Mehr reported. He went on to say that another U.S. strategy is to make Iran stop supporting Hezbollah and the Palestinian resistance groups but Iran will not stop supporting liberation movements.
