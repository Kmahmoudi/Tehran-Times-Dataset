TEHRAN – Iranian First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Saturday that efforts by the Iraqi people and government in organizing and hosting Arbaeen pilgrims are praiseworthy.
 “Launching the big fight against terrorists in Mosul and at the same time managing the Arbaeen march are indications of the Iraqi government’s power,” Jahangiri said during a phone conversation with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. Jahangiri expressed hope that Mosul would be liberated from the terrorists soon. Commenting on bilateral relations, he said, “Good advances have been made in bilateral relations and I hope that Tehran-Baghdad ties would become a role model for the neighboring countries.” For his part, Al-Abadi said that the Iraqi forces will continue fighting until Mosul is cleansed of terrorists. He said that the Iraqi government and people have made any efforts necessary to provide security for pilgrims during the Arbaeen march. Jahangiri also visited the shrine city of Najaf, Iraq, on Sunday to participate in the Arbaeen march. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Azerbaijan, Turkey and other countries marched the main road between Najaf and Karbala on foot to show their devotion to Imam Hussein. About 2 million Iranians have visited Karbala to mourn Arbaeen. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
