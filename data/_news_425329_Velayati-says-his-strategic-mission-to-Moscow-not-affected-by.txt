TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, an international adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution who is in Russia for an official visit, has shrugged off the concurrent trip to Russia by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying “nobody cares” about the Netanyahu’s “baseless and illogical remarks”.

 “He (Netanyahu) is an itinerant person who travels to somewhere in the world every day,” Velayati told reporters upon his arrival in Moscow.  “Therefore, his presence or absence in Russia has no effect on our strategic mission,” he added.  Velayati asserted that Iran and Russia’s ties are “strategic”, citing mutual fight against Daesh in Syria, cooperation at the United Nations and also Russia’s support for crafting the 2015 nuclear deal as “other examples of strategic and long-lasting ties”. “Besides these, mutual relations in the fields of defense, politics, economy, nuclear technology, and security point to a long-term agenda shared by the two countries.” Velayati is in Moscow to submit messages from Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Tuesday that the letters are aimed at “emphasizing the importance of expanded relations between Iran and Russia”. Velayati will likely hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. On his visit to Russia, Velayati said, “The current situation is very sensitive as the world is under the influence of a sinning person under the title of the president of America, therefore, such cooperation becomes more and more necessary, which is why I am being honored to carry the messages of the Supreme Leader and the president.”  Velayati to depart to China after Russia visit The Foreign Ministry spokesman said Velayati will also pay a visit to China to convey messages from Ayatollah Khamenei and Rouhani to Chinese leaders. Qassemi said that after the U.S. withdrawal from 2015 nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was a strategic mistake by the U.S. president, Tehran decided to send special envoys to convey the messages of top Iranian leaders to other countries. “In these messages, our country’s views and stances regarding the United States’ selfish and illegal behavior are explained to other countries,” he said.
