TEHRAN – The plan to ban employment of the retired managers is scheduled to be implemented in two months.
 The plan falls within a parliamentary approval and endorsement by the Guardian Council. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, spokesman of the Guardian Council, has said that organizations and bodies to which the plan applies have two months to take action in line with the ratification, the Arman daily reported on Saturday.  He said the ban includes governors, ambassadors and deputy ministers but not Guardian Council members, vice president, heads of the three branches of government (president, judiciary chief, and parliament speaker), deputy parliament speaker, and presidential aides. Kadkhodaei added that exceptions have been made to war veterans who suffer from over 50 percent disabilities, those who were held captive for more than three years in the Iraqi prisons following Iraq’s war against Iran in the 1980s, and also children of the martyrs. He also said that the armed forces follow different rules. According to the Farheekhtegan newspaper, the Guardian Council has approved that 1970 retired managers, including 18 governors and 96 deputy ministers, should give up their seats in two months. Amirhossein Zamaninia, the deputy oil minister; Seyed Mohammad Ali Afshani, the mayor of Tehran; and Governor of Tehran Mohammad Hossein Moghimi are among the retired managers, Farheekhtegan reported.
