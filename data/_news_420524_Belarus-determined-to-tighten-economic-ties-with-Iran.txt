TERHAN- On the threshold of the 14th meeting of Iran-Belarus Joint Economic Committee, Belarusian Industry Minister Vitali Vouk told IRNA on Friday that his country is determined to boost economic ties with Iran. "In the occasion of the two-day economic committee which is planned to be held in Tehran on January 22 and 23, a Belarussian delegation will make a visit to the Iranian capital," he announced. “Our visiting delegation to Tehran is bigger than the previous ones, since new areas of cooperation for the two sides have been created and we hope that financial turnover between Iran and Belarus will hit $500 million in near future," he said.
 
“We are to discuss further cooperation with representatives from Iran’s various sectors such as industry, medicine, electrical vehicles, petrochemicals, and agriculture,” the Belarussian minister added.
