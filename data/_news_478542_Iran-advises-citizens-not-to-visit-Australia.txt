TEHRAN - Iran has advised its citizens not to travel to Australia for the “possibility of arbitrary arrests.” In a travel advisory issued on Wednesday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iran called on nationals to avoid traveling to Australia. The ministry has especially advised students, researchers, and university professors, to reconsider unnecessary trips to the country. It warned about a possible arbitrary arrest of Iranian nationals in the country and extraditing them to hostile governments “without any reason,” the ministry statement said, Tasnim reported. It further said “activities of extremist and racist groups” have been reported in Australia, increasing the likelihood of threats, racist insults, and assaults “at any place and time.” The ministry said if any Iranian national is detained by the Australian authorities, they must inform the Iranian embassy in Australia “as soon as possible” and “request consular access.” “Otherwise, under the pretext of privacy law, Australian police and judicial system will avoid informing the embassy,” the statement noted. It particularly referred to “illegal and inhumane behavior” of Australian authorities in the country’s prisons, which have in some cases caused “long-term injuries” and even “death of prisoners.” AM   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
