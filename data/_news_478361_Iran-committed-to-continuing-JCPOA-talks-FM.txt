TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian reiterated Iran’s commitment to continuing talks in Vienna over reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.  Speaking at the first meeting of the National Coordinators of the Group of Friends in Defense of the United Nations Charter, Amir Abdollahian said Iran is committed to continuing the nuclear talks with goodwill and based on mutual respect.  “The sole purpose of these negotiations should be the strong commitment from all sides to fully implementing their obligations under the nuclear deal,” he said.  The foreign minister added, “However, America must prove that it has goodwill and genuine resolve and does not intend to use the negotiations for killing time and looking for another excuse for the continuation of the breach of its commitments and the continuation of the sanctions, to which that country has become severely addicted.” Iran has said the U.S. does not have the will to make the necessary political decisions to conclude the long-running nuclear talks. Talks over the nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), have come to a standstill. U.S. officials have recently said that the JCPOA is no longer on their agenda, at least for now.     All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
