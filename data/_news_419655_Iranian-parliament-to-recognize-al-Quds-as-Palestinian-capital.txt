TEHRAN – The Iranian parliament on Sunday voted in favor of a double-urgency bill that recognizes al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the permanent capital of the state of Palestine. The bill was passed by 187 votes in favor, 15 against and 9 abstentions. It came as a response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of al-Quds as the capital of Israel, a move that angered the international community, especially the Muslim world. Trump also announced that he will move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city. The motion will be annexed to Article 1 of a legislation that states Iran’s support for the Palestinian nation. It has been referred to a relative parliamentary committee and will be put on the parliament’s agenda within the next 48 hours. The Islamic Republic has long been a staunch supporter of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and urged Muslim nations across the globe to unite against the Zionist regime. On Thursday, in response to Trump’s incendiary move, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution by a decisive vote of 128 to 9, calling on the U.S. government to reverse the decision.
