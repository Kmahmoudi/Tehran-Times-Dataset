TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Sunday denied reports that Iran has closed its land border with the Iraqi Kurdistan in the aftermath of the region’s independence vote. “We have already closed our airspace to the Iraqi Kurdistan Region at the request of the central government of Iraq, and as far as I am aware, no new development has occurred in this regard,” ISNA quoted Qassemi as saying. The remarks came after a Kurdish official said Tehran had closed its border crossings with Kurdistan since Sunday morning. MH/PA
