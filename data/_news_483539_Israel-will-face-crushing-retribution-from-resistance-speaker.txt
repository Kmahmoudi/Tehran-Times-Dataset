TEHRAN- The speaker of Iran’s parliament on Sunday strongly denounced Israeli aggression against Palestinian worshipers at al-Aqsa Mosque during the fasting month of Ramadan and warned that the occupation regime will face a severe penalty from the resistance for its heinous crimes. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf made the comments following the Israeli regime’s ongoing defilement of al-Aqsa and violent raid against Palestinian worshipers practicing Ramadan-related rites at the holy site. Speaking at the beginning of a plenary session of the parliament on Sunday, Qalibaf said, “I firmly condemn the vandalism of al-Aqsa Mosque, the first qibla of Muslims, the detention and beating of visitors and worshipers in that holy place, as well as the cruel onslaught of the Zionist regime on the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon.” The Zionist regime, he continued, is an unfettered and progressively lawless killing machine by disregarding all international laws. On this year’s Quds Day, the final Friday of Ramadan, the speaker of the Iranian parliament urged all Muslims worldwide to join together in support of their brave and resilient brothers and sisters in Palestine and advance the cause of the Holy Quds. “The Zionist regime is currently at its lowest point in history, and as a result of the might of the opposition front, the regime has been compelled to behave cowardly,” he said, adding, “The Zionist regime is aware that a severe and devastating retribution is in store for them on the promised day relying on the strength of the opposition front.” Hundreds of men, women, senior citizens, and children were staying overnight to pray in the Qibli prayer hall when heavily armed Israeli police attacked the al-Aqsa Mosque compound on Tuesday night. They then fired tear gas and stun grenades into the building. Rubber-coated steel bullets were reportedly also fired, according to several witnesses. Then, before detaining the worshipers, Israeli police pummeled them with batons and riot arms, inflicting several injuries. More than 30 rockets were launched Thursday from southern Lebanon towards the occupied territories in retaliation for Israeli attacks on al-Aqsa. The occupying regime also targeted Palestinian strongholds in Lebanon and Gaza. The Israeli regime has placed severe restrictions on Palestinians’ access to and departure from the gates of al-Aqsa Mosque ever since the beginning of the holy month. Israeli settlers continue their regular invasions and provocative rituals at the holy site despite the escalating hostilities with Palestinian worshipers.
