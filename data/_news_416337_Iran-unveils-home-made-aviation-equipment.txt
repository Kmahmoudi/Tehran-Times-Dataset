TEHRAN – On Monday Iran unveiled four homegrown electronic aviation systems for civil and military applications.

 The four systems, called Sama, Samee’, Baseer, and Samet-1, were unveiled in a ceremony in Tehran attended by Farzad Esmaili, commander of the Khatam ul-Anbiya air defense unit.  Sama is used for detecting aerial targets and controlling air traffic. It is the first of its kind made in a Western Asian country. It automatically receives data from flights crossing the Iranian airspace and defines the flight path in a short span. This system would be used to assist the Iranian Civil Aviation Organization in air traffic control and obviate the need for importing foreign equipment. Another system, Baseer, has the ability to monitor and transfer data from radar and navigation systems to the command and control center, replacing six data analysis and transfer systems. Utilization of Baseer would annul the need for 54 forces on each working shift. The next system, Samee’, is a mobile system for the collection of radar and navigation data, which can be mounted on manned or unmanned aerial vehicles. Samet-1 is also an automation system coordinating the air defense sites that collect data. SP/PA
