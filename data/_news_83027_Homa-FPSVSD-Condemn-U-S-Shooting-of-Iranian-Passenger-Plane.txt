The U.S. shot an Iranian Aribus over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988 by two missiles shot from American warship Vincennes. The shooting martyred all the 290 passengers that included 156 men, 56 women, and 57 children. Some 37 passengers were nationals of India, former Yugoslavia, UAE, Pakistan, Italy, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. Since the shooting was intentional, it is among the rare cases in the history. Meanwhile the Foundation for the Preservation and Spread of Values of Sacred Defense (FPSVSD) in a statement termed the downing of the Iranian passenger plane by the U.S. the most heinous act and the most painful human tragedy.
