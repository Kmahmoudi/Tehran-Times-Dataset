TEHRAN – The director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Willian Burns, has expressed concern about growing cooperation between Iran and Russia.  In a rare interview, Burns told PBS’s Judy Woodruff that he is “quite worried” about the relationship between Tehran and Moscow.  “And what's beginning to emerge is at least the beginnings of a full-fledged defense partnership between Russia and Iran,” he said.  Burns claimed that within this partnership Iran is “supplying drones to the Russians” and “the Russians beginning to look at ways in which, technologically or technically, they can support the Iranians, which poses real threats to Iran's own neighborhood, too many of our friends and partners in Iran's neighborhood as well.” The CIA director alleged that Iranian-made drones are being used in Ukraine. “And I think it can have an even more dangerous impact on the Middle East as well if it continues. So, it's something that we take very, very seriously,” he added.  Over the last few months, the West has leveled accusations against Iran regarding the war in Ukraine. They have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia for use in the Ukraine war, a claim Iran roundly rejects.  Citing senior Biden administration officials, NBC News alleged recently that Russia is now providing an "unprecedented level" of military and technical support to Iran in exchange for Tehran supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine. “As part of the enhanced partnership, Russia may be providing Iran with advanced military equipment and components, including helicopters and air defense systems. In the spring, Iranian pilots trained in Russia to fly the Sukhoi Su-35, a Russian fighter jet, which the officials say indicates Iran ‘may begin receiving the aircraft within the next year,’” NBC News said. While Iran and Russia have not confirmed U.S. allegations yet, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby openly accused Iran and Russia of deepening their military cooperation. Citing alleged intelligence assessments, Kirby accused Russia of moving to provide advanced military assistance to Iran, including air defense systems, helicopters, and fighter jets, part of deepening cooperation between the two nations.  He said Russia was offering Iran "an unprecedented level of military and technical support that is transforming their relationship into a full-fledged defense partnership." Kirby said Russia and Iran were considering standing up a drone assembly line in Russia for the Ukraine conflict, while Russia was training Iranian pilots on the Sukhoi Su-35 fighter and Iran could receive deliveries of the plane within the year, according to a CBS News report.  The UK leveled similar accusations.  UK Ambassador to the United Nations Barbara Woodward alleged that Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles, and offering Tehran an unprecedented level of military and technical support in return. “Russia is now attempting to obtain more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles,” said Woodward, adding, “In return, Russia is offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support. We're concerned that Russia intends to provide Iran with more advanced military components, which will allow Iran to strengthen their weapons capability.” In October, the Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York issued a non-paper explaining Iran’s position on Ukraine amid Western accusations in that regard.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran's position on the Ukraine situation is clear, consistent, and unwavering, which has been pronounced since the start of the conflict. From the beginning, the Islamic Republic of Iran has always emphasized that all UN Members must fully respect the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as applicable international law, including sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. As a country that has experienced 8-year imposed war and aggression, Iran opposes any conflict or war anywhere in the world, including in Ukraine,” the mission said.  It added, “Iran has consistently advocated for peace and an immediate end to the conflict in Ukraine and expressed clearly that this crisis has no military solution, and building upon this belief, Iran has urged the parties in the conflict to exercise restraint, avoid escalating tensions, and engage in a meaningful process for settling their disputes through peaceful means while also addressing the root causes of the situation.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
