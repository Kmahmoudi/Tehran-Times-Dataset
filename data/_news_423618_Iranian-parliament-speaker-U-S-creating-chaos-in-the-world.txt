TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Tuesday that the U.S. is creating chaos in the world by trying to undermine the United Nations which is tasked to guard peace and security in the world. 
 “The U.S. seeks to annihilate the UN which is an international institution established to create peace in the world and to cause security chaos at the international arena,” he said at an open session of the parliament. He noted that the U.S. move in relocating its embassy in Israel to Quds (Jerusalem) is against the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly’s charter, saying the U.S. seems to be discrediting this international institution. U.S. relocated its embassy in Tel Aviv to al-Quds (Jerusalem) on Monday. Israeli snipers shot dead 60 Palestinians and wounded thousands who protested the relocation. Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to al-Quds has been blamed for the bloodshed.  Among the dead were eight children, including eight-month-old Laila Anwar Ghandour. The health ministry said the baby was asphyxiated by tear gas, CNN reported. Larijani said that killing the Palestinian protesters is a “shame” for the U.S. and the Zionist regime of Israel which will go down in history. “It is obvious that these killings come from frustration of the Zionist regime and reveal its mess,” he added. Elsewhere, he said that the Palestinians will achieve victory through resistance. The U.S. move in relocating embassy happened a day before the anniversary of the forcible Israeli eviction of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homeland in 1948 known as Nakba Day, meaning Day of the Catastrophe.
