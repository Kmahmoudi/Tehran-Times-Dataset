The proposal is known as the Hormuz Peace Endeavour (HOPE). Zarif also thanked Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan for his efforts to deescalate tension in the Persian Gulf region. Khan, leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, visited Tehran on Sunday for talks with top Iranian leaders. He said the purpose behind his visit was to prevent a new war in the region. He said he is trying to “facilitate” dialogue between Tehran and Riyadh, which their relations have deteriorated badly in recent years over a number of issues including the war on Yemen and also Riyadh’s unwavering support for Trump’s anti-Iran policies. Khan also visited Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
