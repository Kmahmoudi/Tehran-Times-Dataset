TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps is establishing provincial divisions that it calls “development and prosperity bases”.

 IRGC spokesman Ramazan Sharif said on Sunday the bases will serve construction, civil development, fight poverty, establish security through public cooperation, and facilitate public services.  He added that besides organizing public human resources to achieve their goals, the bases will engage in close cooperation with other state and private organizations. The move addresses the Leader’s guidelines on resistance economy, he underlined. SP/PA
