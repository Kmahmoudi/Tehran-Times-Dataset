TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution said on Monday that protecting and implementing the revolution’s norms are difficult and challenging, noting that “revolution never ends” and that Islam has new things to say about human beings, politics, politics, etc.
 Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei made the remarks during a meeting with seminary students of Tehran province. Those who opposed the revolution “in principle act in the same way to counter the revolutionary norms,” the Leader noted.  “It is essential to fight to establish the revolution’s norms and create Islamic society as it was essential to fight to achieve victory of the revolution,” Ayatollah Khamenei remarked. The Leader went on to say, “We do not have an Islamic society. We do not even have an Islamic government. We managed to create an Islamic revolution, that is, a revolutionary movement. We managed to create an Islamic system based on that revolution. These are important things we gained so far; however, thereafter creation of an Islamic government, and Islamic administrations are needed for the country. We still have a long way to go in this regard,” the Leader said, according to the leader.ir. Commenting on duties of clergies, he said, “Today, the human being, especially the young generation, need to hear new words and Islam has new and interesting things to say about human being, society and politics which will have audience if conveyed to the world.” He said that the clergymen should follow the path of prophets in introducing “pure life” and “monotheistic ideology”. Ayatollah Khamenei also highlighted the importance of using media and cyberspace to send the message of Islam to the world. Elsewhere, he said that “firm determination, enthusiastic movement and campaign” are required to solve problems. The Leader also said that some individuals and authors argue that the campaign for the revolution has come to an end but this is a “betrayal of the revolution”.  “The revolution continues; saying that the revolution has ended, and now we can go back to normal life, is treachery against the revolution. The revolution never ends.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
