TEHRAN – A member of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee has said that an offshoot of the Gonabadi Dervishes has links to Mossad and the CIA, Mehr news agency reported on Tuesday. “Due to the nature of this dangerous, Daesh-like group, which is affiliated with Mossad and CIA, the three branches of government, especially the Judiciary, as well as security forces and police must not show the slightest tolerance towards them,” Abolfazl Hassan Beigi said. The lawmaker further said there are three branches of Dervishes, adding that one of them has resorted to armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic. In a riot in northern Tehran on Feb. 19, a member of the cult group rammed a bus into security forces killing three policemen.
