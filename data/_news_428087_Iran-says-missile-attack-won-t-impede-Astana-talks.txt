TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday that Iranâ€™s missile attacks on IS terrorists in Syria will not cause any impediment to the process of the Astana talks. Contacts and consultations among Iran, Russia and Turkey within the framework of the Astana talks will continue, he said in a press conference. Early Monday, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps launched missiles at IS positions in Syria in retaliation for the September 22 terror attack in the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz. On September 22, four gunmen attacked a military parade in Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan province, killing 24 people and wounding 69 others. A four-year-old child was among the killed. The Astana peace talks were launched on Jan. 23-24, 2017 with the aim of putting an end to the Syrian crisis.
