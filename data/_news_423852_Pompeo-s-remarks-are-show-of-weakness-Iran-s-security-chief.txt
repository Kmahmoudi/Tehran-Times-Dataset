TEHRAN – Iran’s Secretary of Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said on Tuesday that the U.S. “fruitless efforts” to restrict Iran’s rising power and influence are sign of Washington’s “weakness”.
 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the U.S. will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic. Shamkhani said Pompeo’s remarks are a “proof of the Islamic Republic’s generative power at home and abroad.” The new U.S. secretary of state also demanded that Iran halt all uranium enrichment, stop its ballistic-missile program and give nuclear inspectors access to the entire country. In response, Shamkhani said a country which has the record of using nuclear weapons against the (Japanese) civilians and also equipping the “brutal and child killer” Zionist regime of Israel with sophisticated weapons “is not qualified” to make comments about Iran’s nuclear program. Shamkhani says it is “understandable” that the United States and its regional allies, which are the main creators and supporters of the Takfiri terrorism, are “angry” that Iran prevented Daesh (ISIL) to spread its domain of ruling in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even Europe. The top security official said the UN nuclear watchdog as the only international monitoring body has confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear activities. Pompeo’s speech came nearly two weeks after Trump withdrew from the 2015 international nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He said the history has shown that “foreign threats” have intensified “consolidation” and “unity” among Iranians. The security chief added “empty threats” will also have no effect on the “will of people and officials for continuing the current dignified path.” Shamkhani also said Pompeo’s allegations of Tehran’s support for terrorism are just a “psychological warfare”. Shamkhani, a former defense minister, went on to say that it is “understandable” that the United States and its regional allies, which are the main creators and supporters of the Takfiri terrorism, are “angry” that Iran prevented Daesh (ISIL) to spread its domain of ruling in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even Europe.
