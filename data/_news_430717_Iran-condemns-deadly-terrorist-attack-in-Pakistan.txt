TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry has strongly condemned a recent attack on a border checkpoint in Pakistan’s Balochistan province which led to the death and injury of a number of Pakistani troops. In a statement issued on Saturday, ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi sympathized with the Pakistani government and people as well as the families of the victims in the terrorist incident, the Foreign Ministry website reported. Qassemi renewed Iran’s call for any joint campaign with Pakistan against the scourge of terrorism in the region “in any form or shape”. According to the Star Tribune, some 30 militants attacked the Frontier Corps convoy on Friday, killing six soldiers and wounding 14. Four attackers were killed in the shootout. The militants captured around a dozen Iranian border guards near the border in October.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
