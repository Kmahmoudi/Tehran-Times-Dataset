However, Haj-Babaei said he would personally predict a massive turnout because this is an indication of trust between the people and the officials in all ranks of the country. Haj-Babaei told the Mehr News Agency that the Majlis and the government should recognize people’s efforts to realize their demands. Haj-Babaei, who represents Hamedan in the Majlis, said the Guardian Council (GC) and the Ministry of the Interior should take the measures necessary to promote high voter turnout and underscored the need to refrain from measures that could discourage people from participating in the elections. Voter Turnout in Upcoming Majlis Elections Affects National Security MP Reza Talaei-Nik said Sunday that voter turnout in the upcoming Majlis elections would have a direct affect on Iran’s national security. Talaei-Nik told the Mehr News Agency that voter turnout would have a more significant effect on enhancing Iran’s international status than the quality of the elections. He said that foreign threats against Iran will increase in the future, stressing that the Majlis elections could play a major role in decreasing those threats. Talaei-Nik highlighted Iran’s favorable prospects in the area of national and economic development, which he believes could become a determining factor in boosting national solidarity and facilitating Iran’s development in all areas. But he said that excessive criticism of the performance of the government over the past 10 years has created a climate of mistrust among the people, stressing that officials should try to eradicate that mistrust by sincerely responding to people’s demands. Talaei-Nik, who represents Kaboudar Ahang in the Majlis, said people need to be satisfied with the state of affairs of the country so that they can trust officials and be encouraged to participate in the polls. He added that the mass media should reassure people that the elections will be fair and democratic, saying this would set the stage for constructive rivalry between political parties in the elections. Political Parties Should Compete in a Fair and Honorable Manner Majid Ansari, a Majlis deputy representing Tehran, said Sunday that according to the Constitution, members of the Majlis have the right to ratify legislation for all the country’s affairs such as development programs, the national budget, and everyday laws, and this will enable the country’s structures to change and improve. Ansari told the Mehr News Agency that encouraging people to vote in the seventh Majlis elections requires certain measures, adding that merely inviting people to the polling booths will not guarantee a high turnout. The Expediency Council member said that there has been some negative propaganda against the government and the Majlis, adding that people should made be aware of the services the government and parliament provides in order to encourage them to increase their participation in the country’s affairs. Ansari also highlighted the importance of the Majlis and said that voter turnout in the seventh Majlis elections would play a significant role in determining the destiny of the country. The Iranian nation, particularly the youth, should realize that their vote will become the foundation of the country’s decision-making process, he said. Ansari, who is also a member of the Assembly of Experts, said that political groups and parties should compete with each other in a fair and honorable manner and should avoid the use of slander and dirty tricks, adding that this could result in a fair and successful election. Ansari pointed to the necessity of unity and concord between voters and electoral officials and added that the current situation in Iran is worrying. There has been a long dispute between the Guardian Council and the Interior Ministry on the electoral law, which could discourage people, he said. The Majlis deputy also said that people should be assured that candidates that they find acceptable will be able to easily qualify for the elections. Hopefully we will experience a free, Islamic, and open election with the help of a joint committee which has recently been established by the president, the Majlis speaker, and the secretary of the Guardian Council, he said. Ansari added that people should be informed that the anti-Iranian propaganda of the Zionist and U.S. media is only meant to promote their own interests and is not in the best interests of Iran. Imam Khomeini constantly reminded the people about the fact that if your enemies are sensitive about a matter then it is to your benefit to respond, he said. Ansari stressed that the Iranian nation is vigilant and has stood against its enemies many times in recent years. Thus, in light of the U.S. threats, the Iranian nation should participate in record numbers in the seventh Majlis elections, he said in conclusion.

The Expediency Council member said that there has been some negative propaganda against the government and the Majlis, adding that people should made be aware of the services the government and parliament provides in order to encourage them to increase their participation in the country’s affairs. Ansari also highlighted the importance of the Majlis and said that voter turnout in the seventh Majlis elections would play a significant role in determining the destiny of the country. The Iranian nation, particularly the youth, should realize that their vote will become the foundation of the country’s decision-making process, he said. Ansari, who is also a member of the Assembly of Experts, said that political groups and parties should compete with each other in a fair and honorable manner and should avoid the use of slander and dirty tricks, adding that this could result in a fair and successful election. Ansari pointed to the necessity of unity and concord between voters and electoral officials and added that the current situation in Iran is worrying. There has been a long dispute between the Guardian Council and the Interior Ministry on the electoral law, which could discourage people, he said. The Majlis deputy also said that people should be assured that candidates that they find acceptable will be able to easily qualify for the elections. Hopefully we will experience a free, Islamic, and open election with the help of a joint committee which has recently been established by the president, the Majlis speaker, and the secretary of the Guardian Council, he said. Ansari added that people should be informed that the anti-Iranian propaganda of the Zionist and U.S. media is only meant to promote their own interests and is not in the best interests of Iran. Imam Khomeini constantly reminded the people about the fact that if your enemies are sensitive about a matter then it is to your benefit to respond, he said. Ansari stressed that the Iranian nation is vigilant and has stood against its enemies many times in recent years. Thus, in light of the U.S. threats, the Iranian nation should participate in record numbers in the seventh Majlis elections, he said in conclusion.
