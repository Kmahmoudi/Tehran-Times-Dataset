He also emphasized that the Iranian nation, despite enduring cruel and extensive sanctions, managed to defend its political independence and successfully continue its scientific and economic progress. During the meeting, Goita for his turn, welcomed the agreements reached between the two countries to strengthen their economic cooperation. He also said the achievements by the Iranian nation in confronting the oppressive sanctions and gaining the important political and economic position by the Iranian nation in the regional and global arena are role models for the Malian nation to fight against the excessive demands by some foreign governments. He added the successful political management of Iranian officials in advancing the country’s economic and scientific growth is valuable. In the end, the head of Mali’s transitional government called for further strengthening of the economic-commercial and scientific cooperation between the two countries and emphasized Bamako’s readiness to host Iranian industries and economic activists. The Iranian foreign minister also met his Malian counterpart. The two foreign ministers signed a memorandum of understanding for the first joint commission for comprehensive cooperation. They also held a joint press conference at which Amir Abdollahian underlined that economic, defense and educational cooperation with Mali is a priority for Iran’s Foreign Ministry. He said, “We hope that we will set up Iran's scientific and industrial exhibition in Mali soon.” Amir Abdollahian added, “Cooperation between Mali and Iran in international organizations is an important area of interaction between the two countries.” He added experience shows that the policy of sanctions against nations has not been successful and for this reason, we do not view the bans imposed on Mali as constructive.
