The Zoroastrian community annually gathers at Pir-e-Sabz, a Zoroastrian temple situated in Yazd, central Iran, to practice specific rituals and traditions.  From June 14-16, Zoroastrian pilgrims make their way to Pir-e-Sabz, or Chak Chak, nestled in the rock face, to pray in the spot where Princess Nikbanoo, the daughter of the last Sassanian king Yazdegird III escaped the Arabs.  The word Sabz is Persian for “green” and refers to the small burst of greenery surrounding the temple in an otherwise desert landscape.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
