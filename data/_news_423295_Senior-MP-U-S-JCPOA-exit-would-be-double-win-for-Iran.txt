TEHRAN – Deputy Majlis Speaker Ali Motahari on Sunday shrugged off Washington’s possible move to leave the 2015 nuclear deal, called the JCPOA, saying such a step would be a “double win” for the Islamic Republic.  If the U.S. leaves the JCPOA, not only its international status would be undermined, Iran would also no longer be obliged to fulfill its undertakings under the deal, Motahari said, Tasnim reported. He also slammed the U.S. for creating a commotion over Iran’s missile program, asking emphatically, “Does America allow us to decide on its missile power?” MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
