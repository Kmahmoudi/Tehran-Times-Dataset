TEHRAN – Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps drones have destroyed several Daesh bases on the Syrian border with Iraq.

 According to an IRINN TV report on Sunday, during the IRGC operations carried out in Syria’s eastern Dayr al-Zawr province, many terrorists were killed in the attacks. Large amounts of Daesh weaponry were also destroyed, the report added. It said the attacks were part of operations aimed at clearing the Syria-Iraq border of the remnants of the terrorist group. On June 18, the IRGC fired six medium-range ground-to-ground ballistic missiles at Daesh bases in Syria’s Dayr al-Zawr in retaliation for twin terrorist attacks in Tehran on June 7. The gunmen mounted almost simultaneous assaults on Iran’s Parliament and the mausoleum of the founder of the Islamic Republic Imam Khomeini. Daesh claimed responsibility for the assaults. In the terrorist attacks 17 were killed and over 50 others injured.
