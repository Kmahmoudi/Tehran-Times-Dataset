TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly condemned terrorist attacks in the Iraqi cities of Tikrit and Samarra that killed several people, including some Iranian pilgrims in Samarra. Expressing condolences to the families of victims of the deadly attacks, the ministry reminded the international community of its “responsibility” to battle terrorism and fight off Takfiri groups. “The Islamic Republic of Iran will stand beside the Iraqi government and nation until the complete defeat… of terrorism,” ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. Iran says will stand beside Iraq until complete defeat of terrorismThe spokesman also described the cruel attacks as an attempt to retaliate consecutive defeats that terrorists have recently suffered in Iraq. In Tikrit, a bomber detonated his explosives-laden ambulance at the southern entrance to the city during the morning rush hour, killing 13 people, police and hospital sources said. Another attacker detonated a vehicle in a car park for pilgrims visiting one of Shiite Muslims’ holy sites, the shrines of Imam Hadi (AS) and his son Imam Hassan al-Askari (AS), in Samarra, 125 km north of Baghdad. The bomb killed at least eight people including seven Iranian pilgrims in Samarra, local officials said. The local operation command, a joint military and police unit, said the vehicle used in Samarra was also an ambulance. The number of Iranians wounded there was reportedly 16. According to Iranian Red Crescent Society Relief and Rescue Organization director Pirhossein Koulivand, the bomb blast in Samarra blew up a nearby bus carrying Iranian passengers. No one has yet claimed responsibility for Sunday’s attacks, but Daesh frequently carries out suicide bombings targeting Iraq's Shia majority, whom it considers heretics.
