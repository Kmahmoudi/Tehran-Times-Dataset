TEHRAN- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani on Sunday showed reactions to the latest spurious allegations and stances by the German and French leaders, calling them non-diplomatic, meddlesome, and provocative.  Kanaani added that the current approach taken by the German chancellor toward the Islamic Republic is “aggressive” and “intrusive”.  “Sadly, some so-called human rights defenders have forgotten about their nefarious history of backing the Saddam regime against the patriotic Iranian people,” Kanaani highlighted.  Kanaani was openly referring to the supply of raw materials to Iraq’s Saddam Hussein in the 1980s to build chemical weapons in which the Iraqi dictator used against Iranians civilians and soldiers and the Iraqi Kurds. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman added, “They have politicized the issue of human rights by enforcing unfair sanctions following the U.S.'s May 2018 unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JAPOA) and by remaining silent regarding the Daesh terrorist moves, the most recent of which occurred in a holy site in southcentral Iran.” While Germany sidesteps its international responsibilities to respect other countries' national sovereignty, the Islamic Republic upholds the principles of human rights, which include respect for the people, battle against oppression, and protection of the downtrodden, Kanaani stated. ‘It’s unusual for Macron to undermine his position and meet a despised puppet’While Germany presents itself as a promoter of human rights, it shelters terrorist and anti-Islamic Republic organizations and applies a double standard policy toward crimes committed by the Zionist regime.  Kanaani recommended German officials to restore sanity to the cooperative atmosphere and avoid further deterioration of relations. Building trust and honoring mutual interests is the only way to ensure long-term cooperation, the spokesman remarked. In remarks on Saturday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Iran should expect more sanctions from the EU, euro news reported.  He added that his country stands "shoulder to shoulder with the Iranian people".  Scholz's remarks came ahead of an EU meeting on Monday, where foreign ministers will mull slapping Iran with new sanctions.  A European diplomat, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, said that about 30 people were set to be sanctioned by the bloc. They are likely to be the country’s insiders or individuals linked to the government.  The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson also slammed a meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron and a highly controversial person and others accompanying her on the sidelines of the Paris Peace Forum. Such an anti-Iran move will undoubtedly be remembered by the great Iranian people, according to Kanaani.  He went on to underscore that “it is unusual for a president of a country that claims to be an advocate of freedom to undermine his position and meet with a despised puppet who has openly made hate remarks and attempted to intensify terror attacks inside Iran and against its diplomatic centers outside the country.” Furthermore, the official condemned Macron's statements who referred to the riots in Iran as a "revolution". Kanaani remarked that “Macron's meeting is a blatant breach of France's international obligations in the fight against terrorism and aggression. Such approaches are predicted to spread these horrible occurrences.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
