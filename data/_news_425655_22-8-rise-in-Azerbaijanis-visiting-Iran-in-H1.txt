TEHRAN â€“ A total of 579 Azerbaijani nationals visited Iran during the first half of 2018, increasing 22.8 percent from a year ago, IRNA reported. Meanwhile, number of Iranians visiting the neighboring country dropped by 18.8 year-on-year percent from March to June, the report added. Over the past couple of months, the number of Iranian outbound passengers to some destinations including Azerbaijan has decreased, largely in tandem with the rise of foreign currency prices in the country. Statistics indicate that 99,158 Iranians visited the country during the first three months of the year. Currently, citizens of 15 countries including Iran can obtain Azerbaijan visas via self-service terminals upon arrival at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport in Baku.
