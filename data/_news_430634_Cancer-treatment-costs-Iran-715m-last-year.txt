TEHRAN — Treatment of cancer cost Iran 30 trillion rials (nearly $715 million) last year (March 2017-March 2018), Payam Azadeh, the scientific secretary of the third International Clinical Oncology Congress has said. 
 Cancer rate is increasing in Iran as the population is growing older; stomach cancer and breast cancer are among most prevalent cancers in Iran and their treatment is costly, Azadeh said, Fars news agency reported on Friday.  With some lifestyle changes such diseases are preventable, for instance 90 percent of the patients diagnosed with lung cancer are smokers, he highlighted.  By warning the public and raising awareness cancer rate will drop, he added. Deputy Health Minister Reza Malekzadeh said in April that “population-based cancer registry of the Islamic Republic of Iran” shows a cancer incidence rate of 158 per 100,000 of the population and 143 per 100,000 of the population (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) in 30 provinces of Iran annually.  The database indicates that the rate for all cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) for men and women combined was 182 per 100,000 in 2012 which means that the rate of cancer in Iran is well below the world average, he highlighted. According to World Health Organization cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer. Around one third of deaths from cancer are due to the 5 leading behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use. The economic impact of cancer is significant and is increasing. The total annual economic cost of cancer in 2010 was estimated at approximately $1.16 trillion.
