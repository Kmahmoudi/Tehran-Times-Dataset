TEHRAN – Iran’s ambassador to Beirut said on Friday that declaring Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of the Zionist regime is against the international and Islamic consensus. “Quds will remain the capital of Palestine, and the wars and conflicts in the region will not affect the Palestine cause,” said Mohammad Fathali, IRNA reported. Speaking at a ceremony commemorating the Islamic Revolution anniversary, he also said the best solution to conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain is to hold national dialogue between conflicting sides.
