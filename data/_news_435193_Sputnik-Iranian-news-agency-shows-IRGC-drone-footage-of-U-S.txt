TEHRAN - Iran's Tasnim news agency has published a video shot by a drone belonging to the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) flying over a U.S. aircraft carrier and an accompanying ship in the Persian Gulf, Sputnik reported on Saturday.  The video shows the carrier's deck in detail, including the types and number of aircraft on it. The media outlet didn't specify when the footage was shot but said that it was released by the IRGC.  The carrier in the video appears to be the Nimitz-class nuclear-powered USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69). Its last reported deployment in the Persian Gulf was in December 2016.  The drone that took the footage is an Ababil-3 with an eight-hour flight capability at 3,658 meters and a 250-kilometer range. The development comes after the U.S. ended sanctions waivers on Iran’s oil exports and designated the IRGC as a "foreign terrorist organization". Tehran immediately retaliated by declaring the United States a "state sponsor of terrorism" and U.S. forces in the region "terrorist groups". Also, Iran’s military chief threatened on Sunday that if his country would not be able to export oil from the Strait of Hormuz then no other country can. “If Iran’s oil is not going to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, definitely others’ oil will not pass through the strait either,” asserted Major General Mohammad Baqeri, Iran’s armed forces chief of staff.
