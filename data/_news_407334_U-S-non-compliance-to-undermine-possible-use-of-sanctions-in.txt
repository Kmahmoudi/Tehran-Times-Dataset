TEHRAN – A former U.S. official who has been named architect of sanctions on Iran believes if the U.S. does not abide by its commitments under the nuclear deal, its ability to use such coercive measures as a tool in the future will be undermined. Richard Nephew told Tasnim on Friday, “We have European banks and companies saying that they don’t believe they can do business in the Islamic Republic without triggering U.S. sanctions.” SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
