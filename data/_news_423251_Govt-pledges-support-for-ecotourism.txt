TEHRAN – Iran’s government is bound to broadly support the growth of ecotourism in the country. “Support of ecotourism is on the agenda by providing loans to applicants who are seeking to found eco-lodges,” IRNA quoted government spokesman Mohammad-Baqer Nobakht as saying on Thursday. “I recommend those who own rural houses, but have not applied yet, to participate in the plan with the aim of promoting cultural exchange and [expanding] eco-lodges as financially profitable units for villagers and households,” the official added. Due to a very diverse natural setting, Iran offers a lively and interesting environment to nature lovers. Sightseers may live with a nomad or rural family or enjoy an independent stay and assist with day-to-day village activities, while learning about rustic routines, agriculture, wildlife, traditional art and culture. Back in January, the Iranian administration approved a bill allocating 24 trillion rials (some $600 million) to empowering rural areas and small towns in arenas of handicraft-associated jobs, ecotourism and hospitality industry.
