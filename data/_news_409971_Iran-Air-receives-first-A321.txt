Iran Air has formally taken delivery of an Airbus A321, the first in a batch of 100 jets ordered by the flag-carrier under a landmark fleet-renewal deal with the airframer.
 Speaking at the handover event in Toulouse, Iran Air chief executive Farhad Parvaresh said: “Today, for civil aviation in Iran, is a memorable day.” He referred to a “change in international perspective” which had helped to lay foundations for the agreement. Airbus commercial aircraft president Fabrice Bregier said the delivery fulfilled a “long-held ambition” to see a new Airbus flying in Iran Air colours. “This agreement is one of the most significant deals in the history of civil aviation,” he added during the ceremony.
