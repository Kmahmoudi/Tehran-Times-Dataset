TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that the U.S. president’s “deal of the century” plan for the future of Israel and Palestine will die before Donald Trump’s life comes to an end. 

 The Leader’s remarks came in a meeting with a large number of people from all walks of the life in the Imam Khomeini Hosseiniyeh in central Tehran.  Addressing a pro-Israel audience at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by his side last week, Trump announced the general provisions of the deal of the century. The White House claimed that the plan is the most serious, realistic, and detailed plan ever presented, one that could make Israelis, Palestinians, and the region safer and more prosperous. In his Wednesday address, Ayatollah Khamenei said that the deal of the century is an “evil, failed and insane” plan.  “The way to counter the plan is keeping courageous resistance by the Palestinian nation and groups as well as the Islamic world’s support,” the Leader suggested. The Leader reiterated his previously declared proposal of a general referendum in the occupied lands so that the native inhabitants of Palestine can determine their fate, saying this “can be a basic solution” to the Palestinian issue.  “The Americans think cheerfully that their plan against the Palestinian nation will be successful by selecting a big name for the plan (Deal of the Century), however, the move is insane and evil. The plan from its beginning has been against them,” Ayatollah Khamenei went on to say.  Noting that deal of the century will die before the Trump’s death, he said the plan is certainly doomed to failure.  “The Americans are trading something with the Zionists that is not their own asset,” the Leader said, adding Palestine belongs to the Palestinians who are entitled to decide about their fate.  The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Monday rejected the plan. The 57-member body, which held a summit on Monday to discuss the plan in Saudi Arabia's Jeddah, said in a statement that it "calls on all member states not to engage with this plan or to cooperate with the U.S. administration in implementing it in any form. Also, the Arab League rejected the plan. At an emergency meeting of the Arab bloc in Cairo, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attacked the proposal, saying his people would never accept it. In a statement on Tuesday, the EU High Representative Josep Borrell also voiced the European bloc's rejection of the Trump administration’s deal of the century.   ‘Those who love Iran should vote in upcoming elections’  Elsewhere in his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei said, “Those who love dear Iran and its credit and intend to solve the problems should take part in the upcoming (parliamentary) elections.” He added that the people must come to the scene on the elections day to manifest the country’s national might and firm will. The Leader also pointed to the Feb. 11 rallies marking the 41st victory of the Islamic Revolution, saying, “I appreciate the Iranian nation that in spite of the cold weather have taken part in mass rallies to mark the victory anniversary of the Islamic Revolution over the last 40 years.”   The parliamentary elections, the 11th of its kind since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, will be held on February 21.
