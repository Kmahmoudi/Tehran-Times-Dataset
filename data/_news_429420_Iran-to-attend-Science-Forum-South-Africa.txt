TEHRAN – A delegation of Iranian entrepreneurs and businessmen will attend the Science Forum South Africa (SFSA), which will be held from December 12 to 14 in Pretoria.   Headed by the vice president for science and technology Sourena Sattari, a group of knowledge-based company owners will hold B2B meetings with their counterparts during the event. SFSA2018 positions itself between an academic and research conference, where research papers are presented, and a science engagement meeting, where science is made popular, often with a focus on the youth. The event is a celebration of science, technology, and innovation where we ignite conversations about science on the middle ground between academics, policy, and popular science engagement.  In early October, Sattari headed a delegation of officials and knowledge-based companies’ directors to Kenya and Uganda in order to boost the market of Iranian knowledge-based companies in eastern Africa.
