TEHRAN - The U.S. Congress passed on Saturday another act against the Iranian nation which signifies nothing but a blatant and flagrant violation of human rights, leaving a trail of meddlesome measures. Congress has reportedly passed the Masih Alinejad HUNT Act, named after the so-called journalist working in cahoots with foreign-backed intelligence agencies. “It’s official: Congress passed the Masih Alinejad HUNT Act imposing mandatory sanctions on Iranian officials responsible for the ongoing suppression of basic human rights in Iran and identifying all foreign banks doing business with these sanctioned individuals,” the Senate Banking Committee Republicans Twitter account said purportedly on Saturday. The bill slaps penalties on foreign persons (i.e., people or organizations) engaged in the harassment of certain people, such as human rights advocates.
