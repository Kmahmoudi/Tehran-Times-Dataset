TEHRAN— The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani on Monday night strongly condemned a decision by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the European Union to impose unilateral sanctions against some Iranian officials and entities, describing it a violation of international law and a clear example of interference in the internal affairs of Iran. The diplomat further said, “It is deeply regrettable that certain political motivations as well as relying on baseless, distorted information and fabricated claims by the enemies of the Iranian nation and the well-known media affiliated with them are the basis of such a wrong and unconstructive decision.” Kanaani evaluated the sanctions decision as an indication of the continuation of a biased approach and exploitation of human rights as a tool to achieve political goals, and called the decision “fundamentally rejected, ineffective and invalid.” The spokesman further emphasized, “The great nation of Iran already considers the European Union and its members as the great violators of human rights due to their inaction and cooperation regarding the illegal maximum sanctions of the United States.” Rejecting the accusations levelled against Iranian individuals and institutions, Kanaani added, “In response to today’s action by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the European Union, reciprocal sanctions will soon be imposed and announced against relevant European individuals and institutions.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
