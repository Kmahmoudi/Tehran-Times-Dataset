TEHRAN – The Interior Ministry of Tajikistan has denied reports that Iranian drones manufactured in Tajikistan were provided to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. The Ministry repudiated allegations that Iranian drones produced in Tajikistan were sent to conflict zones in Ukraine, Fars News reported, citing Interfax.  Earlier, the Tajik foreign ministry had denied in a statement the allegations regarding the production of Iranian drones in the country to be used by Russia against Ukraine. Over the last few weeks, the West leveled massive allegations against Iran over the alleged export of Iranian drones to Russia in the midst of war in Ukraine.  Iran denied that it took sides in the Ukraine war.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian spoke over the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, on Friday to discuss the matter.  They discussed the latest developments related to the Ukraine crisis and bilateral topics, according to the Iranian foreign ministry. Amir Abdollahian strongly dismissed the claims about the use of Iranian drones in the war in Ukraine, saying, “The Islamic Republic has had the experience of the eight-year imposed war and is thus opposed to war in Ukraine, Yemen, and elsewhere.” The Iranian foreign minister said, “We have good ties with Russia and we have had defense cooperation from the past, but our policy toward the Ukraine war is to respect the territorial integrity of countries, not to send weapons to the conflicting parties, and to stop the war and the people’s displacement.” “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s policy is fully transparent, is based on a unified standard, and is against war,” he said. “We are ready for convening technical sessions with the participation of military experts between the two countries, without the need for any intermediary,” the foreign minister added. He described the statements of some Western officials as baseless and referred to Tehran’s recurrent efforts to help bring about a ceasefire to the war. “We stand ready to help establish a truce.” “I believe Ukraine had better be careful not be influenced by some radical politicians in Europe,” the top diplomat said. The Ukrainian foreign minister, in turn, praised the Islamic Republic of Iran’s position on not dispatching arms for use in the Ukraine war, saying talks between technical military delegations of the two countries are important. He pointed to Ukraine’s independence in its foreign relations and said his country does not take action under the influence of others. The chief diplomat explained the consequences of war in his country and said Ukraine strives to safeguard the security and activities of embassies in accordance with international conventions. The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York also issued a statement explaining Iran’s position on Ukraine.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran's position on the Ukraine situation is clear, consistent, and unwavering, which has been pronounced since the start of the conflict. From the beginning, the Islamic Republic of Iran has always emphasized that all UN Members must fully respect the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as applicable international law, including sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. As a country that has experienced 8-year imposed war and aggression, Iran opposes any conflict or war anywhere in the world, including in Ukraine,” the mission said in the statement.
