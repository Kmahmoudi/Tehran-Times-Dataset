TEHRAN – The fall of Daesh in Syria was a defeat for the United States, Leader of the Islamic Revolution said in a meeting with large number of Basij members on Wednesday. Speaking ahead of National Basij Week, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei applauded the endeavors of the young men in nullifying U.S. plots and conspiracies in West Asia, saying, “In the region, the Islamic Republic and you, young individuals, managed to bring America to its knees and defeat it. All their efforts and plots were aimed at clearing up the ideologies of the Islamic Revolution or resistance from the region, but the exact opposite occurred.” “The real cause of the demise of the cancerous tumor of Daesh was the Basiji morale. Enemies tried to use this inhuman, Takfiri group to render an incident against the resistance current, but devout, zealous, and motivated youth entered the battlefield and brought the enemy to his knees.” Citing the 1979 Islamic Revolution as an example on how victory can be achieved, Ayatollah Khamenei touched on extraordinary successes against terrorists in Syria and Iraq but other countries were doubtful and willing to submit to the enemy's plots. "One of the enemy's known strategies is to disappoint our youth. Unfortunately, some act like mouthpieces for the enemy, spreading hopelessness, saying it's not possible to resist such enemies. And, why not? The Islamic Republic has stood up against the enemies' avarice and has defeated the enemy in all cases." Speaking on the success of the mobilization forces and nullify the enemies' conspiracies, the Leader said, "You have witnessed that these consecutive conspiracies, which were created in this region by America, Zionists, Arab reactionaries and others, were destroyed by the sovereignty of the Islamic Revolution. One of the conspiracies was the inhumane Takfiri group, Daesh, which was destroyed, thanks to the efforts of faithful men, with the help of those who supported the resistance force." Ayatollah Khamenei then mentioned how vast the manifestation of Islamic Revolution's ideals became in the midst of fight against the enemy, although some were doubtful. "Even in some of our neighboring countries, sometimes, they did not believe that it was possible to accomplish this [defeat of Daesh]. But, they had to join the fight: they entered the battlefield; they succeeded and came to believe it was possible. This is how the message of the Islamic Republic, the message of the revolution, reaches other nations."
