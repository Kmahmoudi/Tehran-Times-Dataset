TEHRAN - In recent days, Tony Blair's opposition to Britain has increased since the departure of Britain from Europe. This is while Tony Blair has been sentenced by British citizens for the lies he had given during the 2003 war in Iraq. On the other hand, Tony Blair has no place in the political equations of the Labor Party. While trying to oppose the withdrawal of his country from the European Union, he is seeking to support EU leaders to return to his country's political scene. A review of Tony Blair's latest position shows that he is trying to take advantage of the dissatisfaction with the British withdrawal from the European Union to return to the political and executive scene of his country. Labour should prioritise stopping Brexit ahead of winning the next election, Tony Blair has said. The former Prime Minister said the party would “be saying what’s right” if it came out in opposition to the UK leaving the EU, and suggested the stance would also expose divisions within Conservative ranks. As The Independent reported, He added he believed that “stopping Brexit is the route to win power” for Labour, and rejected the idea that accepting the referendum result was necessary to avoid the risk of losing support in former industrial heartlands. When asked in The Guardian whether he agreed support for Brexit was a sacrifice worth making to win, he replied: “I don’t actually. No. I think this principle’s too important.” He added: “I’d like to see a Labour government in power. But I think the key national priority right now is stopping Brexit. I would put it above everything else right now for the country.” Blair said he understood the “very pragmatic position” that Labour had taken to avoid being painted as the anti-Brexit party, but said this put them in the same position as the Conservatives – arguing to leave the EU but retain close trade links. The strategy was also stopping Labour from focusing on the “destructive impact” of Brexit, and the distraction the “Tory psychodrama” was having on improving public services and the economy. He acknowledged Labour would have a “huge fight” if it came out in opposition to the referendum result, but added that “you’d be fighting from a point of principle”, and said he believed “stopping Brexit is the route to win power”. He said: “Think of what a galvanising movement you would have in those circumstances, because you would actually be – well, for a start you’d be saying what’s right. That’s quite an important thing to start with. “Secondly, I think the impact on the Tories would be really profound, because you’d be driving a wedge right into that Tory division – and the Tories are a profoundly divided party.” The British public has swung behind staying in the EU by its largest margin since the referendum, with those backing Remain outstripping Leavers by ten points, a new poll has revealed. The exclusive survey for The Independent by BMG Research showed 51 per cent now back remaining in the union, while 41 per cent want Brexit. Once “don’t knows” were encouraged to choose one way or the other, or excluded, the Remain lead rises to 11 points. Either way, it is the biggest gap since the June 2016 vote. BMG Research head of polling, Dr Michael Turner, said: “The last time Leave polled ahead of Remain was in February 2017, and since then there has been a slow shift in top-line public opinion in favour of remaining in the EU.  “However, readers should note that digging deeper into the data reveals that this shift has come predominantly from those who did not actually vote in the 2016 referendum, with around nine in ten Leave and Remain voters still unchanged in their view.  “Our polling suggests that about a year ago, those who did not vote in the referendum were broadly split, but today’s poll shows that they are now overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU, by a margin of more than four to one.” Finally, Tony Blair tries to recall himself as the leader of the struggle against the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union at the current time. This is despite the fact that many of the objections raised by the British withdrawal from the European Union are fundamentally not related to Tony Blair and his thoughts. In such a situation, many British citizens oppose the high profile of their prime minister in favor of Brexit. It should be noted that negotiations on the British withdrawal from the European Union between London and Brussels are hard to come by, and many analysts of European issues report the possibility of failing to negotiate.
