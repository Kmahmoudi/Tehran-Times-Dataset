Like other Iranians, people living in the northern Mazandaran province celebrate Yalda Night - the longest night of the year on the last eve of autumn - in a gathering called Chelleh Sho in local language. Watermelon, yoghurt and nuts including almonds, pistachios, raisins, figs and dried berries as well as roasted wheat and peanut are amongst the eats served during the Chelleh Sho. 
Medlar, which is named Konos in local language, is one of the main fruits, which is eaten during the night. They also cook a special kind of cookie named ‘Posht Zik’ with sesame and sugar. During the night, one blackens his face and goes door to door to collect money for poor families to live during winter.  People read Holy Quran and pray for late members of their families during the night. Various tribes and ethnic groups who live in different parts of Iran are just like colors, which make a great painting. Iran is home to about 20 ethnic groups who live in different regions of the country.
