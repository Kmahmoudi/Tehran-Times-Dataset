TEHRAN — The cabinet of ministers has allocated some 50 billion rials (nearly $1.25 million) to compensate for the losses rangers might suffer while protecting the wildlife, IRNA news agency reported on Wednesday. Rangers who risk their life protecting the environment and wildlife sometimes fall victims by getting into fight with poachers and may either suffer severe wounds, get killed, or charged with involuntary manslaughter. For instance, Mohammad Dehqani and Parviz Hormozi were killed in June 2016 during an armed conflict with poachers in Hormozgan province and Asadollah Taqizadeh was sentenced to death for killing a poacher in July 2007 in Dena forest. Fortunately in Taqizadeh’s case the deceased family spared his life and he got released from the prison in March 2016. However, recently the environmentalist and environmental bodies have plead for proper law and support for these wildlife protectors who endanger their lives to safeguard the environment. Earlier this month the Department of Environment has put forward rangers’ protection bill to the cabinet, which aims to make regulations and restrictions more stringent on poachers. The bill also proposes harsh punishments for poachers who attack rangers and help to expedite the decision-making process for the cases involving rangers.
