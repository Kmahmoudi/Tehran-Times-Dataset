TEHRAN- The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force said on Tuesday that the Palestinian people will finally liberate their country from Israeli occupation, cautioning the regime that the age of hit-and-run is over. Brigadier General Esmail Qaani issued the warning during a ceremony on Tuesday commemorating the first martyrdom anniversary of former Iranian ambassador to Yemen Hassan Irloo, who succumbed to death due to COVID-19 problems during the Saudi regime's and its allies' siege of the Arabian Peninsula state. Approximately 50 operations against Israel are conducted per day in the occupied West Bank alone, according to Qaani, who also mentioned how desperate and under siege the Israeli regime is right now. He continued by saying that the Palestinians will soon drive the Israelis from their territory. The day when Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani was assassinated by a U.S. drone attack in Iraq, General Qaani said “We told Israelis to sell their homes and leave Palestine.” “Today, we see that in the occupied territories, old Jewish figures have created organizations to promote leaving the occupied territories,” he pointed out. The most recent event occurred a day after a well-known Israeli regime general said that Palestinians in occupied Palestine are forming a communication network, which terrifies Israeli officials and elites, coming into sense that they face an existential threat. Additionally, Palestinian government representatives have reaffirmed that the Palestinian resistance front would continue to fight Israel until all of the occupied territories have been emancipated.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
