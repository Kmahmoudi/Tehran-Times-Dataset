She said that "Clean Earth Day" is being held to encourage people to cooperate and to inform them of the need for sound management of the disposal of hazardous industrial waste. Vice President Ebtekar also said that, unfortunately, bad management is causing increased land and water pollution. The bill on hazardous waste will soon be presented to the cabinet, she said, adding that the Department of the Environment is understaffed but that 700 people will be hired by the end of the current year (March 20). Pointing to the fact that 10 percent of Iran's forests are nature reserves, she said that various methods are being used in order to preserve and protect these forests. She referred to using local facilities as well as making use of volunteer forces, called local cooperators, as other ways to protect these forests.
