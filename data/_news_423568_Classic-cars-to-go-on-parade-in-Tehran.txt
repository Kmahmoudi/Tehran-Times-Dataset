TEHRAN – The Touring & Automobile Club of the Islamic Republic of Iran (TACI) is scheduled to stage a historical car parade across Tehran on May 16. A total of 50 vintage and classical vehicles will stage the parade on the occasion of the national cultural heritage week, ILNA quoted TACI Director Ramin Afshani as saying on Saturday. The event will also put an end to vintage and classic car show, which opened its doors to the public at the Sadabad Cultural-Historical Complex on March 22, Afshani added. Addressing itinerary of the parade, he explained that it will commence from the Sadabad complex in northern Tehran to the National Museum of Iran and the UNESCO-registered Golestan Palace in the downtown and it will finally stretch back to the complex. Sprawled on about 110 hectares of a mountainside parkland in northern Tehran, the Sadabad Cultural-Historical Complex is used to be a royal summer residence during the Qajar era (1789–1925) and subsequent Pahlavi epoch (1925–1979).
