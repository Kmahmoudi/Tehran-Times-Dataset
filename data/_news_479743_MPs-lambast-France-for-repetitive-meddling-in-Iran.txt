TEHRAN – A group of 194 Iranian lawmakers issued a joint statement on Wednesday castigating France’s “repetitive meddling in Iran’s internal affairs,” according to Iran’s state news agency IRNA.  “Recently, the representatives of the French National Assembly and senior officials of this country, including the president and its foreign minister, in an interventionist action and contrary to the principle of non-interference in the affairs of countries, which is one of the fundamental principles of international law and the principles contained in the United Nations Charter, especially paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter have made statements and actions seeking intervention in the affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the lawmakers said in the statement. They added, “On the one hand, the President of France supports the leaders of the Hypocrites [Mojahedin-e Khalq], which is a terrorist group, in his territory and egregiously holds a meeting with the opponents of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who officially seek to overthrow a UN member state.  On the other hand, he sends his spies inside the country under different guises to harm the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran by participating in riots and managing them.” According to the lawmakers, France sends its spies to Iran to damage the vital centers of the Islamic Republic, and when they are arrested, they seek the release of their spies through media and political pressure. The statement said, “France defends the rights of women in the Islamic Republic while the history books are full of pictures of the crimes committed by this country in 30 years of crimes in Algeria, especially the massacre of October 1361 in Algeria.” It said, “With this long history of crime, France has no right to speak of human rights and raise a white flag with its dirty hands through its inappropriate interference in the internal affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. These cases and other important issues show that the representatives of the French parliament have more important issues to investigate and question the French government, so that they may have an answer for the people of this country. Instead of interfering in Iran's internal affairs, it is better to answer all the crimes of France in history and contemporary times as soon as possible.” Tensions have escalated between Iran on the one hand and some European countries on the other hand over a range of issues, including Iran’s unrest.  The French foreign minister said on Tuesday that Iran's chargé d'affaires was summoned due to what he called Tehran's role in the Ukraine war. The French foreign minister said the Iranian ambassador was also summoned for the role of Iran's security forces in allegedly suppressing rioters and dealing with 7. Nearly two weeks ago, Iran summoned the French ambassador, Nicolas Roche, over France’s positions on the Islamic Republic.  French citizens in custody The French ambassador to Tehran was called in by the Foreign Ministry over the adoption of an anti-Iran resolution at the French National Assembly and unacceptable remarks by the European country’s top diplomat, Tasnim reported at the time.  The Foreign Ministry filed Iran’s strong protest at the baseless allegations by French officials against Tehran. It also strongly condemned this unacceptable interference in Iran’s internal affairs. The French ambassador, Nicolas Roche, was told that the exploitation of human rights by France and some other European countries as a tool and their double standards toward the issue is highly regrettable and unacceptable for Iran. So it is necessary for the European states to return from their wrong path, which violates the indisputable principles of international law that stipulate respect for the sovereignty of nations. It was noted that these governments lack the merits and competence to make claims about human rights because of their resorting to unilateral and bullying methods which are at odds with the interests of nations, the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s website reported. The French National Assembly passed a resolution on Monday condemning what it termed a "crackdown on non-violent demonstrators.” During the session, Colonna said the European Union was working on new anti-Iran sanctions at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers that was held on December 12.
