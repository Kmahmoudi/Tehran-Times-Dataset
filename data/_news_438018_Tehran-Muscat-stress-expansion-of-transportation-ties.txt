The first shipping route between the two countries was put into operation in March 2015 between Iran’s Bandar Abbas and Oman’s Sohar. In December 2016, Iran and Oman inaugurated direct shipping routes from two Omani ports to the Iranian port of Shahid Bahonar. Later in December 2017, the two country launched another shipping line which connects Iran’s port city of Khorramshahr to the Omani port of Sohar. According to Iran-Oman Joint Chamber of Commerce, the Bandar Abbas- Sohar route which was temporarily closed due to U.S. sanctions on Iran, has also resumed operation.
