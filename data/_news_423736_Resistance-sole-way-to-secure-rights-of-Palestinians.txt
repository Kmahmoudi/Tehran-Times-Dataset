TEHRAN – Following the U.S. move in relocating its embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds (Jerusalem), a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker said on Saturday that resistance is only way for Palestinians to secure their rights. “Palestinian resistance will not allow the U.S. embassy to remain unscathed in al-Quds,” Hossein Amir Abdollahian said in a meeting with Hamas representative in Tehran Khaled Al-Qadoumi. “The main agents of disability and insecurity in the region are the U.S. and the Zionist regime,” added Amir Abdollahian, who once served as Iran’s point man for Arab affairs.
