TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani late on Friday castigated U.S. President Joe Biden for claiming to “free Iran”. Kanaani said the United States has always been an occupier in its history and it can never be a liberator. Wherever the U.S. stepped in, it brought nothing but killing, looting and instability, he said. He said nations in the region and across the world are witnessing the repercussions of U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. "Daesh-style liberation comes from Daesh's godfather; nothing else," the spokesman tweeted, Press TV reported. Biden on Thursday vowed to “free” Iran and said protesters in the recent riots in the country would soon succeed in freeing themselves. "Don't worry, we're gonna free Iran. They’re gonna free themselves pretty soon," Biden said during a campaign speech in California. Biden’s remarks drew a strong rebuke from President Ebrahim Raisi who said Iran was released from the U.S. captivity in 1979 and it will never be a U.S. puppet again. “Iran was freed 43 years ago and is determined not to be occupied by you. And we will never be (your) milk cows,” Raisi said in a speech he delivered Friday on the anniversary of the U.S. embassy takeover. “End hypocrisy” Also on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian took a swipe at the White House for supporting the riots in Iran while at the same time insisting on reaching an agreement with Tehran on the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal, saying Biden should abandon his hypocritical approach and support for terrorist groups such as Daesh. "Simultaneous with open support for violence & terror during recent riots in Iran, WH is reaching out for an agreement," Amir Abdollahian tweeted. "Mr. Biden: end this hypocrisy—incl support for terror & ISIS," he wrote. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
