TEHRAN- Manufacturing of refrigerators and freezers in Iran during the first five months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21- August 22) has risen 13.6 percent from that of the same period of time in the previous year, IRNA reported citing the data released by the Ministry of Industry, Mining and Trade. As reported, 515,300 refrigerators and freezers have been manufactured during the five-month period of this year. Since the U.S. reimposed sanctions on Iran to pressure the countryâ€™s economy, Iran has been taking all necessary measures to mitigate the impact of the sanctions and counter the U.S. actions. Improving and boosting domestic production has been one of the major strategies that Iran has been following in the past two years in order to increase its independence. And to realize this objective, providing the required working capital for the production units and offering them facilities is one of the major measures being pursued by the government to support these units in this year which is named the year of "Pickup in Production" by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei.
