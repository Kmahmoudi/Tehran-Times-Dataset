She made the statement in a ceremony to inaugurate four petrochemical projects by President Hassan Rouhani in the southwestern port city of Assaluyeh which is home to 30 petrochemical complexes that receive gas and gas condensate feedstock from the giant South Pars gas field Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf. The four inaugurated petrochemical projects will raise the country’s annual output and revenue by 2 million tons and $2 billion respectively. Some $883 million has been invested for implementation of these projects, according to Shahdaie. Completing the chain of value is the approach to be adopted for the new projects, the NPC managing director noted adding that future petrochemical projects will bring foreign investment and technology to the country.  ‘52 petchem complexes active in Iran’ Shahdaie further announced that some 52 petrochemical complexes are active in the country and put the total nominal production capacity of them at 60 million tons per annum.
