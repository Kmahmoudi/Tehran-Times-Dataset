TEHRAN - President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that the Iran is ready to confront the U.S. and make Washington regret for exiting the 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposing sanctions on Iran.
 “Undoubtedly, the Iranian people will resist and the government is totally ready to confront. With the grace of God, we will pass the difficulties we have been facing over the past months and will make the U.S. regret, because they [the U.S.] have chosen a wrong path,” he said before departure to New York to attend the annual UN General Assembly meeting. He said that the current U.S. administration has adopted a unilateral and extreme nationalistic ideologies, and in such a situation Iran has many things to say at the UN General Assembly. “They respect no agreement. They respect neither the (UN) Human Rights Council nor economic agreements and the Paris (climate) agreement… this administration has ideologies of unilateralism and extreme nationalism. In this situation, I think many countries especially Iran have many things to say,” he said. He added that the UNGA is an opportunity for Iran to express its stance. “The international situation is not good. The U.S. is taking bullying actions more than ever. It [the U.S.] continues adopting unilateral policies and imagines it can take actions based on force. When a country hosts an organization, it should not think that it has full authority over that organization. The U.S. authority over the United Nations should be to the same extent as of other countries,” Rouhani stated. He noted that during his visit to New York, he will talk about the U.S. "crime" of violating the international agreements. President says U.S. will never achieve its plots in Iran  Elsewhere, Rouhani said that the U.S. seeks to cause chaos in Iran, however, he said Washington will never reach its objectives. Rouhani also said that Iran will respond to terrorist attack in Ahvaz, the capital of Khuzestan province, which left 25 people, including women and children, dead. “It is obvious for us that they [the terrorists] are affiliated to what group. Those who make claims about the human rights should stand accountable. The U.S. supports mercenary countries in the region and provides them with help, however, these actions do not affect our people’s determination. We will respond to these crimes and all the perpetrators will be punished,” the president pointed out. Rouhani blames ‘mercenary’ countries for Ahvaz attack  Rouhani also blamed the U.S.-backed “mercenary” countries in the region for the deadly terror attack in Ahvaz.  “It is the U.S. who provokes them and helps them to commit crimes. All of these have no effect on our people’s determination. Our people have stood against bigger crimes,” he pointed out. He expressed hope that all the perpetrators behind the Ahvaz terrorist attack will be arrested and punished. IRGC says terrorists will face ‘deadly and unforgettable vengeance’ The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) also issued a statement on Sunday saying those behind the terror attack will soon face “deadly and unforgettable revenge”. “Considering (the Guards’) full knowledge about the centers of deployment of the criminal terrorists’ leaders..., they will face a deadly and unforgettable vengeance in the near future,” the statement said.
