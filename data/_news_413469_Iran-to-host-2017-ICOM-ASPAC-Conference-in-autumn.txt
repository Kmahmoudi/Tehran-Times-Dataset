TEHRAN â€“ The upcoming edition of the ICOM-ASPAC Conference and General Assembly will be held in autumn in Chabahar, a port city in southeast Iran. The purpose of holding the conference in Iran is to deepen [cultural] ties with other Asia-Pacific member states, ISNA quoted the ICOM-Iran director Seyyed Ahmad Mohit-Tabatabaei as saying on Sunday. Sponsored by the International Council of Museums, such meetings provide opportunities for the member states to recognize their roles in defining, promoting and implementing sustainable development practices. Many museums are contributing to the community with promotion of scientific studies and releasing scientific data and information of museum collection. Others play a role in attracting tourists for regional developments as well. AFM/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
