Harvesting Damask rose, known as Gol-e Mohammadi in Iran, is an annual practice in Meymand, a city in the southern province of Fars. 
The city produces over 10,000 tons of rose water out of the flower, accounting for over 60 percent of Iran’s rose water export. 
Iranians use Damask rose in cooking, tea serving, and celebrations in its various forms, although it doesn’t play much part in the Western societies. 
The flowers are also renowned for their fine fragrance, and are commercially harvested for extracting rose water and oil. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
