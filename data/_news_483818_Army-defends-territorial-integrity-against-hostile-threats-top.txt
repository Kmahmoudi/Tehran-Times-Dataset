TEHRAN- Iran’s top general praised the Army for its role in defending the nation’s territorial integrity in the face of all hostile actions. Major General Mohammad Baqeri, the chief of staff of the armed forces, made the comments on Monday in a message to Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, the Army chief. Congratulating General Mousavi on National Army Day, which fell on April 18 this year, Baqeri pointed out that the Army has made remarkable strides in a number of defense-related areas. The Army’s ground, air, naval, and air defense forces have achieved modern and cutting-edge technology and this has placed the Army in the fore of the nation’s might, deterrence, and security, the military chief said in his message. The IRGC Chief Commander Major General Hossein Salami also praised Armed Forces in a separate message to General Mousavi on Monday. The IRGC and the Army will continue to thwart Iran’s adversaries, Salami said. Writing to Mousavi on National Army Day, Salami said, “There is no doubt that the perceived threats from the camp of malicious and adventurous enemies against Iran are endless.” Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, proposed Army Day in 1979. It is observed yearly. Recent innovations by Iranian engineers and military professionals in the production of a wide spectrum of domestically produced equipment have made the armed forces self-sufficient. Officials have frequently stated that Iran would not hesitate to develop its military capabilities, particularly its missile competence, which is only for defensive purposes, and that Iran’s defense capabilities will never be available to negotiation.
