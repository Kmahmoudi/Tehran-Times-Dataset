TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday that the countries that support the Saudi-led war on Yemen should be held accountable for their crimes.
 The statement by Qassemi came one day after Saudi-led air strikes on Sanaa hit a warehouse near a girls’ school that left at least 13 children dead and many others wounded. “They are an accomplice in bombarding a school in Sanaa and should account for their supports,” the ministry spokesman said. Qassemi strongly condemned the attack and described it as “inhumane”. He also urged the UN to take immediate actions to stop attacks on Yemenis. The Saudi-led coalition backed by the U.S. started the war on Yemen in March 2015 with the aim of reinstating ousted president Mansour Hadi within days. The war has led to famine and spread of cholera in the poor country.  The UN is calling it “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.” On the eve of the fifth year of Saudi Arabia's war on Yemen, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote a post on his tweeter account on March 26 saying the regime in Riyadh should put an end to the "nightmare that this war has become." "On the eve of the war's shameful FIFTH YEAR, a reminder that it's not too late to stop the nightmare that this war has become," Zarif remarked. In April 2015, Zarif submitted a letter to Ban Ki-moon, then UN secretary general, outlining Iran’s four-point peace plan for Yemen. The plan called for an immediate ceasefire and end of all foreign military attacks, humanitarian assistance, a resumption of broad national dialogue, and establishment of an inclusive national unity government. "It is imperative for the international community to get more effectively involved in ending the senseless aerial attacks and establishing a ceasefire," Zarif said in the letter, adding that Tehran is ready to cooperate with the UN “to facilitate and encourage an immediate end to these senseless bombardments and initiation of a genuine dialogue to find a political solution to this tragic crisis.” In his tweet on March 26, Zarif said Saudi Arabia and its allies rejected the proposal "claiming that victory was at hand within THREE WEEKS."
