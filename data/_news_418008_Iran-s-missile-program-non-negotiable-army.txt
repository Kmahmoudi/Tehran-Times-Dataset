TEHRAN – Ahmadreza Pourdastan, Iran’s Army deputy chief, said on Saturday that Tehran would not tolerate any meddling in its defense policies including missile program. “Our missile capabilities are by no means negotiable,” Pourdastan said, adding that the Islamic Republic would not allow inspection of its military sites by any foreign individual under the pretext of inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mehr news agency reported. The remarks came days after Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran will not negotiate with the West over its ballistic missile program. MH/PA
