TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday that Iran does not even think about holding talks with the U.S., insisting negotiation with the “naïve” Trump administration is not on Tehran’s agenda.
 “Given the naïve and uncivilized act of the current U.S. administration in withdrawing from the JCPAO [the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and also the country’s policies against Iran, we do not even think about negotiating with the U.S. let alone talking about the preconditions,” Qassemi said during a press conference. “This issue is not on our agenda. So, there will be no discussion about the preconditions. As I said, we do not think about talks with the U.S.”  Qassemi also said Iran will not talk about its defense capabilities. “Our defense policies are right. These policies are beneficial to the region and we do not hold talks about anything related to defense capabilities,” he asserted. In a press conference at the White House on July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with Iran “anytime they want to” and without “preconditions”. However, hours after Trump’s statements, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CNBC to set some conditions. Back in May, Pompeo had set 12 conditions for talks with Iran, which were dismissed by Tehran. In remarks on August 13, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there will be no war between Iran and the U.S. and nor will be any negotiation between the two countries. The Leader noted that negotiation with the current U.S. administration is impossible. “Even if we were to negotiate with the U.S., we would never hold talks with the current U.S. administration.” Rouhani to attend UN General Assembly Qassemi also said that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will attend the annual UN General Assembly scheduled to be held from 18 September to 5 October. “The president will depart to the United Nations and this is an opportunity that various meetings could be held on the sidelines of the [UNGA] summit at the presidential and foreign ministerial levels,” he stated. Iran, nuclear partners may hold meeting at New York The Foreign Ministry spokesman also said Iran and the remaining parties to the nuclear agreement - Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany - may hold talks at the foreign ministerial level on the sidelines of the UN meeting. Commenting on the talks between Iran and the Europeans to preserve the JCPOA, he said that the talks are on the right path. The European Union trio – Germany, France and Britain - are expected to present their package of proposals to Iran before the second round of U.S. sanctions, which includes ban on Iran’s oil export, takes effect in early November. On Russia’s decision to increase its oil production, Qassemi refrained to give any comments. “I imagine our country’s officials in oil sphere will give some explanations about this issue in upcoming days,” he said.
