TEHRAN - Chief of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Tuesday that Iran has disappointed the enemies who have been working relentlessly to exert pressure on the Islamic Republic.
 The senior commander said the opponents have been forced to acknowledge the progresses made by Iran.   “Great achievements of the Islamic Revolution are not just mentioned by the Islamic Republic’s officials,” he said, adding, “The enemies have also admitted them and have become disappointed with exerting pressure and making threats against Iran.”  Speaking in a ceremony in South Khorassan province, the IRGC commander noted that Iran has never given in to the U.S. economic pressure. Iran’s resistance can be a great lesson for the oppressed countries in the world, he added. “The U.S. has sought to undermine the security and cause harm to the system, however, they do not dare to bring up the issue of overthrowing the system, and will take this wish to grave,” he said. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the JCPOA in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4.
