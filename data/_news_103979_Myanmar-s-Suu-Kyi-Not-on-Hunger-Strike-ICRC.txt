A government spokesman said in a statement officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited Suu Kyi earlier on Saturday and briefed on her condition. "This afternoon the ICRC paid a visit to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to deliver the family messages," the statement said. "According to the ICRC, they found her well and also that she was not on hunger strike as alleged by some quarters." An ICRC official confirmed that two of his colleagues had visited Suu Kyi on Saturday. "What they say is quite true. I do confirm it." U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, asked earlier this week for an update on the status of the detained opposition leader, said on Tuesday: "We had credible information about Aung San Suu Kyi being on a hunger strike." The U.S. government asked Myanmar's military rulers to allow access to the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who won a general election in 1990 but the military prevented her party from taking office. Suu Kyi has been in and out of detention for the past 14 years, most recently the last three months, despite repeated international appeals for her release. The military has detained the Myanmar opposition leader at an unknown location since late May, after a bloody clash between her convoy and government supporters in northern Myanmar. The ICRC visit on Saturday was the second permitted by the military since July.
