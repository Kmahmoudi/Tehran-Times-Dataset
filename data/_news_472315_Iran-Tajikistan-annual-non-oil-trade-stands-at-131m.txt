The ambassador said that in addition to fruitful meetings and talks between the two countries’ officials, important cooperation documents in areas of hydroelectric power plants, transportation and road construction, tunneling, trade, television and radio have been signed.  “The implementation of the construction project of Sangtoodeh-2 hydropower plant can be considered as one of the important areas of cooperation between the two countries,” he added.  Saberi said that Iran took a pioneering step in helping develop infrastructure projects in Tajikistan.  Iranian companies have been active in developing projects such as Esteghlal Tunnel, Dushanbe Water Treatment Plant and other projects, according to the Iranian diplomat. He noted that over the past 30 years, more than 170 important cooperation documents have been signed between Iran and the Republic of Tajikistan, which define the prospects of relations between the two friendly countries and play a decisive role in creating a legal framework for further development of bilateral relations. The Iranian envoy in Tajikistan stated that the two countries have a high potential in supplying each other with required items. Saberi said the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Tajikistan have good cooperation within the framework of regional organizations such as the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and support each other's positions in these organizations.
