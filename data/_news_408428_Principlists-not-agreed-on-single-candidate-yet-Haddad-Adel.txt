TEHRAN – A former MP and prominent principlist figure has said principlists have not yet agreed on a single candidate for the 2017 presidential election.

 On the support of some principlists for Hassan Rouhani, Qolam Ali Haddad Adel said, “People are free and the probability has always been there. But right now effort is being made to steer principlists to a single choice.” On city and village council elections, he said principlists will follow the model of the February 2016 Majlis election.
