TEHRAN- Iran produced 44.202 million tons of petrochemical products during the ten-month period ended on January 20, 2018, Shana news agency reported on Monday citing the data announced by National Petrochemical Company (NPC). Production units in Assalouyeh and Mahshahr petrochemical zones, both in southwest of Iran, accounted for 18.687 million tons and 16.254 million tons of the 10-month output, respectively, and 21 petrochemical units in other parts of the country accounted for 9.261 million tons of the figure. Last July, Ali-Mohammad Bossaqzadeh, the production control director of NPC, announced that seven new petrochemical projects were planned to be implemented in the country by the end of the current calendar year (March 20, 2018). He put petrochemical output at 51 million tons in the past calendar year, saying that the figure is estimated to reach 56 million tons by the end of this year, posting a record for the second consecutive year. Given that Iran ranks the first and fourth in the world in terms of gas and oil reserves, respectively, no country enjoys feedstock as much as Iran to develop its petrochemical industry, according to Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh.
