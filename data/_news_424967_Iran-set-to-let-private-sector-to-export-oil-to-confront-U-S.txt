Speaking in a ceremony to celebrate the national day of industry and mine, the official said that Iranian crude will be offered on the bourse and the private sector can export it, IRNA reported. “Anyone trying to take away Iran’s oil market (share) would be committing great treachery against Iran and will one day pay for it”, Jahangiri warned in an open reference to Saudi Arabia.
