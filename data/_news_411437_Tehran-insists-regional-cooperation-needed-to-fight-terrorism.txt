TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif reiterated Iran’s position on Saturday that cooperation among the countries in the Middle East region is required to fight terrorism.
 “We need regional cooperation to fight terrorism and extremism in the region,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony held to commemorate martyrs of the Iranian Foreign Ministry. He added, “Spreading sectarianism is not beneficial for anyone.”  The minister expressed hope that the neighboring countries would understand the benefits of interaction in countering terrorism. In a speech on February 19 during the Munich Security Conference, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu claimed that Iran was “undermining” regional stability through pursuing what he called a “sectarian policy”. ‘Iran relies on its people’
 
During his speech at the ceremony in the Foreign Ministry, Zarif also said that the Islamic Republic relies on its people. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has been able to maintain security in a region in which there is violence, brutality and murder and succeeded to make advances in various spheres of nuclear and other advanced technologies and the resistance economy,” he explained. He also said that Iran is able to hold negotiations at the diplomatic arena and resist against the pressures. Principles of Iran’s national power are comprehensive and the country needs no one to protect them, he said.
