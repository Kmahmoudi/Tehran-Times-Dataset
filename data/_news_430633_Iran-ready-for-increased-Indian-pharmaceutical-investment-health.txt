TEHRAN — The Iranian health minister has expressed the country’s readiness for an increase in investment by Indian pharmaceutical companies, IRNA reported on Friday.
 “Iran will impose limitations on the importation of pharmaceutical products which will be domestically produced,” Hassan Qazizadeh-Hashemi said in a meeting with representatives of Iranian and Indian pharmaceutical companies in New Delhi, India. Some Indian pharmaceutical companies might aim at exporting medicines to Iran at first, but they can also think of manufacturing pharmaceutical products in Iran in partnership with Iranian companies, he added. He went on to highlight that the world needs Iran and Iran needs the world and despite the current condition and newly imposed sanctions Iran is still carrying out transaction with European and American countries. It is suitable for Indian and eastern Asian countries to seize the opportunity for increased cooperation and exchange of technological know-how with Iran, he added. The Iranian official has travelled to India to attend The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health Partners’ Forum which kicked off on Wednesday. He also held meetings with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi, and Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu.  MQ/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
