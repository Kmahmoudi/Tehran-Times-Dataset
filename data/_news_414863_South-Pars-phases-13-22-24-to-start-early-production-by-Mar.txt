TEHRAN- Early production will be started in phases 13, 22 and 24 of Iran’s South Pars gas field (in the Persian Gulf) by the end of current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2018), Mohammad Meshkinfam, the managing director of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), which is in charge of developing the field, told ISNA. He said the contracts for development of the mentioned phases have been already signed. Meshkinfam also referred to the second phase of developing the gas field and said, “We are in the stage of planning which will be complete by the yearend. Then we will start basic planning and selecting the contractor.” South Pars, which Iran shared with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate. The field is divided into 24 standard phases of development in the first stage. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment.
