TEHRAN — There are ample opportunities for cooperation in urban management projects in Tehran as well as transfer of knowledge and technology between Iran and Germany, German Ambassador to Tehran Michael Klor-Berchtold has said. He made the remarks in a meeting in Tehran with chairman of Tehran city council Mohsen Hashemi, Mehr news agency reported on Friday. The two officials mainly discussed increased cooperation in urban management with exchange of knowledge and technology transfer as well as investment in the sector. “Iran and Germany can cooperate on environment, water and wastewater treatment,” Klor-Berchtold stated, adding that GIZ [German development agency headquartered in Bonn and Eschborn] can cooperate with Iran in the aforesaid sectors. Council chairman Hashemi, for his part, explained that the two countries can collaborate in different sectors such as tourism, public transport, waste management, and renovation of run-down areas. “With regard to the production of 9,000 tons of waste in Tehran on a daily basis we are planning to generate energy from this large amount of waste, so providing Iran with incinerators and waste sorting equipment could be another field of cooperation,” Hashemi explained.  Moreover, the council chairman noted that there exist some 4,000 hectares of rundown areas in the capital which can be renovated in collaborative effort with Germany.
