TEHRAN – Dhia al-Asadi, head of the political bureau of the Sadrist Movement, has said that Washington cannot dictate its Iran policy to Iraq, stressing such meddlesome behavior is “unacceptable”. The Sadrist Movement and its partners in Iraq did not make all the sacrifices to just bow down to the desires and demands of America, al-Asadi told Al Mayadeen, IRNA reported on Wednesday. He further said that the Islamic Republic is Iraq’s neighbor and the two countries have mutual interests, adding that Iraq’s policy is based on its national interests.
