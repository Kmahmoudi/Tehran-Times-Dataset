TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a top foreign policy advisor to the Leader, on Wednesday vehemently rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s ultimatum on the nuclear deal, saying he is going to “beyond his limits”. “The nuclear deal negotiations will definitely not be repeated and nothing will be added or excluded from it. Therefore, the U.S. president's claims are baseless,” Velayati was quoted by Fars as saying. He also strongly rejected any possibility for talks over Iran’s missile program, saying Western countries’ claim that they need to negotiate with Iran on issues like missiles is an “excessive demand”.
