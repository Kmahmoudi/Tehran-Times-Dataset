Saying that the current capacity of Iran’s oil production has reached more than 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), the minister said, “We hope that through the efforts of all those active in this sector, we will reach higher figures in the exports of crude oil, gas condensate, oil products, and petrochemicals in [the current Iranian calendar year] 1401 (started on March 21)”. “By taking effective measures in onshore and offshore oil fields, drilling new wells, repairing wells, rebuilding and modernizing facilities, and oil collection centers, the current oil production capacity has reached before the sanctions, and we have no problem in performance and this amount of production”, Oji added. "Iran's oil exports have risen under the toughest sanctions and without waiting for the outcome of the Vienna talks," the minister had said in mid-March. The increase was thanks to "different methods used to win contracts and finding different buyers," the official added. “The rise had even increased the bargaining power of our team in Vienna," he said, without elaborating. Iran views U.S. sanctions as illegal and has said it will make every effort to sidestep them.
