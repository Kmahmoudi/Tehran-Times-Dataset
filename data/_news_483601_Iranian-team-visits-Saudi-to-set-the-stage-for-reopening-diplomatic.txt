TEHRAN - An Iranian team visited Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to pave the way for reopening diplomatic missions as the two countries prepare to restore ties after seven years. The trip took place just days after a Saudi delegation made a similar visit to Tehran hot on the heels of a historic meeting in Beijing between the Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers who vowed to bring stability and security to the region. "The Iranian delegation arrived in Riyadh on Wednesday to visit and reopen the Iranian embassy and consulate in accordance with the recent agreement between the two countries," IRNA reported. "One team is due to travel to Jeddah to prepare for the reopening of Iran's consulate there and its representation in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, while the other will remain in Riyadh to reopen the embassy," the Iranian Foreign Ministry added. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has been invited to Saudi Arabia. It will be the first visit of its kind since 1999. The flurry of diplomatic activity follows last month's landmark, Chinese-brokered announcement that Iran and Saudi Arabia would work towards resuming ties. Riyadh broke off relations in 2016 after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions following the execution of a Saudi cleric and over 30 dissidents. Since the March 10 announcement, the two countries' foreign ministers have met in China and a Saudi "technical delegation" met Iran's chief of protocol in Tehran last week, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
