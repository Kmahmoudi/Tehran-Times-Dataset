TEHRAN – The Iranian Parliament (Majlis) on Tuesday voted to put the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in West Asia on the list of terrorist groups. According to the parliamentary ratification, the forces and organizations under the authority of the CENTCOM are also considered terrorist. Accordingly, any aid to these forces is tantamount to cooperation with terrorism. The bill was approved with 173 votes in favor, four against, and 11 abstentions. The branding of CENTCOM as a terrorist organization followed after the United States designated the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as a “foreign terrorist organization”. It was the first time that the United States has designated a country’s military as terrorist. The terrorist designation against the IRGC was announced on April 8, one day before elections in Israel. Political analysts, including Noam Chomsky, said the designation was a gift to Benjamin Netanyahu. On the same day that the U.S. took such a move against the IRGC, Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) declared CENTCOM as terrorist and the U.S. government as sponsor of terrorism. Govt. is duty bound to take retaliatory actions against U.S. forces Based on the parliament’s approval, the government is also duty bound to take counteractions against the U.S. forces within the framework of the SNSC approvals. The bill was approved with 166 votes in favor, 9 against, and six abstentions. The government is also tasked to take legal actions against the U.S. move. The government should also provide parliament with reports on the acts taken against the U.S. move against the IRGC. The bill was ratified with 172 votes in favor, 9 against, and 3 abstentions. Foreign Ministry tasked to help close down American bases in region through legal and diplomatic measures Lawmakers also voted in favor of a motion that tasks the Foreign Ministry to make efforts to help close down American military bases in the region by using its legal, political and diplomatic capacities. With 176 votes in favor, 3 against and 2 abstentions, the parliament approved Article 5 of the motion to counter U.S. designation of the IRGC as terrorist organization, Mehr reported. According to the ratified motion, the government is also obligated to support those individuals who are targeted by the United States for cooperating with the IRGC.  NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
