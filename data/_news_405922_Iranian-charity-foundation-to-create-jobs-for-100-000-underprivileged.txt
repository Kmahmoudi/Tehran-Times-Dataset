TEHRAN — The Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation is going to create employment opportunities for 100,000 underprivileged, the foundation’s CEO has said. “Last year we spent some 14 trillion rials (nearly $400m) on creating 120,000 jobs for the deprived help seekers,” Parviz Fattah said, YJC reported on Tuesday. “Our fundamental principle is to help those in distress to stand on their own feet and become self-supporting and no longer live on charity,” Fattah highlighted. Mentioning 650,000 job opportunities created so far he stated that the foundation prefers jobs in good-producing sector rather than service-producing sector.  “We are trying help the individuals to find jobs that suit their personality and build up their self-esteem,” he added.
