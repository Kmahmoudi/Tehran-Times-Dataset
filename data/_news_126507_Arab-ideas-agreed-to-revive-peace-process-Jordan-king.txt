"There are ideas which have been approved in coordination with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, a number of other Arab countries and Palestinian president Abu Mazen (Mahmud Abbas) to relaunch the peace process on the basis of international legitimacy, the Arab peace initiative and the roadmap," he told the pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat Saturday. "The peoples of the region will experience years of violence" unless the moribund peace process is quickly revived, the Jordanian monarch said. The Saudi-authored Arab peace plan, adopted by an Arab summit in Beirut in 2002, envisages Arab recognition of and normal ties with Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from Arab lands seized in the 1967 war. The international "roadmap" to peace was drafted by the so-called Middle East quartet of the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. It was announced in 2003, with the aim of establishing by 2005 a viable Palestinian state living in peace alongside Israel. The Jordanian king also said that anyone seeking "to sow discord between Sunnis and Shiites" was a "traitor to his religion and his nation." Abdullah II told the Saudi-owned daily that Jordan's relations with Syria were "less than good", even though he had "attempted to open a new page since Bashar al-Assad became president."
