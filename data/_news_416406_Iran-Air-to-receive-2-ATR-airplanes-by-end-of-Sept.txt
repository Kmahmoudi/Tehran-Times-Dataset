TEHRAN- Iran’s national flag-carrier Iran Air will receive two passenger jets purchased from the European plane maker ATR by the end of September, Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan announced on Wednesday. As IRNA reported, the official said that with these two planes joining Iran Air, the number of ATR planes in the country’s national airline fleet will reach six. Iran Air took delivery of the first four of the purchased ATR passenger jets on May 17. The 72-600 turboprop aircrafts landed in Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. Iran Air finalized a deal on the purchase of 20 ATR 72-600 from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer in mid-February.  Iran has paid all the prepayments to ATR, Fakhrieh Kashan said at the time, adding that 15 to 20 percent of the total $400 million is paid by Iran and the rest is funded via foreign financers. The 70-seat ATR 72-600 is worth $26.8 million at list prices.  MA/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
