TEHRAN- The capacity of generating electricity from renewable resources has reached 680 megawatts (MW) in Iran, the Energy Ministry announced, IRNA reported on Saturday.
 Power plants based on clean energy resources with the capacity of 445 MW are currently under construction in the country, the report confirmed. So far, renewables have created jobs for 43,680 persons in the country and private sector has made over 101 trillion rials (about $2.4 billion) of investment in this sector. As previously reported, the capacity of generating electricity from renewable resources in Iran is planned to reach 1100 MW by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019). Renewables, including hydropower, account for just six percent of energy generation, versus natural gas’ 90 percent share. Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence in the regional electricity market. According to Iran’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (known as SATBA) the number of small scale solar power plants across the country which are used by households or small industries is being increased noticeably as Iranian households and small industries have embraced the new technology with open arms and investors also seem eager for more contribution in this area. Meanwhile, an official from Iran Renewable Energy Association announced last month that some negotiations for exporting renewable electricity to six Asian countries have been conducted. “The proper ground for transferring and exporting renewable electricity to Iraq, Oman, Afghanistan, Turkey, Armenia, and Tajikistan has been prepared and several meetings have been held in this regard to discuss the issue with the named countries,” Mohammad Javad Mousavi said.
