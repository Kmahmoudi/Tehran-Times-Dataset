TEHRAN – The Supreme Leader warned on Wednesday that if Washington renews a 10-year extension of existing sanctions against Iran before disbanding for the year, Iran will “definitely” react as it breaches the terms of the nuclear deal. “…if these sanctions are extended, it will definitely be a violation of BARJAM (JCPOA) and they (the Americans) should know that the Islamic Republic will definitely react to that,” Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said at a meeting with hundreds of Basij forces in Tehran. On November 15, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a clean, 10-year extension to the ISA by a vote of 419 to 1, mounting pressure on the Senate to follow suit. Senate Democrats favored a 10-year extension akin to the House’s measure. To go through, the bill needs President Obama signing on it. The Leader also rapped Washington for its repeated violation of the nuclear pact, saying, “The current U.S. government has so far violated the nuclear agreement on several occasions with the 10-year extension of sanctions being the most recent of which.” Leader says if these sanctions are extended, it will definitely be a violation of BARJAM (JCPOA) and they (the Americans) should know that the Islamic Republic will definitely react to that. Ayatollah Khamenei further warned Washington against the use of the nuclear deal as a tool to pressure Iran. “The nuclear deal or BARJAM should not turn into a tool to exert pressure on the Iranian nation and country.” The Supreme Leader also referred to the election of Donald Trump as the U.S. president and how his incoming administration may deal with the nuclear deal, saying it would be premature to judge the new U.S. government. “Currently, we cannot make any judgment about the new administration which is due to take office…” President-elect Trump had raised the prospect of pulling out of the JCPOA during his campaign speeches though he watered down his stance later on. On Tuesday, Ali Akbar Velayati, the senior advisor to the Leader, underscored that renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act would amount to violating the terms of the JCPOA. Also, other senior Iranian officials have warned that Tehran will not be silent if Washington fails to respect the deal. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, after Trump was announced president, called on all signing sides to act in compliance with the JCPOA, citing that Iran has options if the deal fails. On Tuesday, Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani appeared critical of numerous moves by the U.S. to violate the JCPOA, warning that Tehran will bring to senses the Americans if they fail to honor the nuclear agreement.  AK/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
