TEHRAN – Ali Khorram, a senior analyst and former Iranian ambassador to UN bodies in Vienna, says the recent U.S.-led attack against Syria was an act of retaliation against Russia and Iran. Speaking with ISNA, Khorram said the U.S., Britain and France could not have launched an extensive war against Syria due to fears of a direct war with Russia and confrontation between Iran and Israel or Iran and Saudi Arabia. “That’s why they tried to do something that was not too big,” said the former diplomat, emphasizing that the attack was more of a symbolic move than a serious war.
