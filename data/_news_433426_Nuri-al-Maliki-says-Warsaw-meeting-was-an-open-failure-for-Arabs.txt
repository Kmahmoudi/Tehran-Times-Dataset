TEHRAN - Former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called the Warsaw conference an “open failure” for Arabs, saying the meeting was primarily intended to deflect attention from the Israeli aggressions in the region to a focus on Iran, ISNA reported on Monday. Speaking on Alahad TV, Maliki warned about the aims of the conference and its danger for the entire region. The Warsaw meeting, co-hosted by the U.S. and Poland on Feb. 13-14, was intended to isolate Iran but it ended in failure as major European countries sent low level officials to the meeting and criticized the U.S. for trying to demonize Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who initially announced that the conference was intended to highlight what he called Iran’s “destabilizing behavior” in the region, was forced to change the agenda of the conference when he faced pressure from Europe and others. Noting that such moves threaten Iraq and all other regional states, Maliki said the Warsaw conference revealed the “secret relationship” between certain Arab states with the Zionist regime which has been existing since some years ago. The former prime minister praised the Iraqi government’s position on the conference and its refusal to participate in it. Citing a story, Maliki said when he was prime minister a foreign minister from an Arab country proposed establishment of “the Middle East economic system” in which Israel would be a member.  “I told the Arab minister that Iraq will not be party to any organization which Israel would be a member,” explained Maliki who is now leader of the Dawa Party.
