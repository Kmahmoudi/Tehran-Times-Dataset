TEHRAN -- Works by the 79-year-old painter, book illustrator, animator and sculptor, Ali-Akbar Sadeqi will be put on display in an exhibition, which is scheduled to open to the public at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) on October 23. Despite his long career spanning over sixty years, Sadeqi remains little known outside of Iran, the LACMA, which is the largest art museum in the western United States, has said in an announcement.  The exhibition has been organized in collaboration with Shirin Gallery in Tehran to commemorate his career. The organizers expect that the exhibition will help introduce his work to the American audience. Sadeqi is scheduled to attend a film screening and discussion set for the opening ceremony. He will also autograph copies of his recently-published book series “Life”, “Love” and “Loss” during the ceremony. The book series was unveiled at Shirin Gallery in April of this year.
