With the help of the neighbors Hoda was taken out of the debris of the house safe and sound but Haniyeh, who is supposed to be hit in the back by the debris was transferred to a hospital in Kermanshah. Her brother and father were also hospitalized in the city of Hamedan; the family didn’t heard from one another for four days.
