TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday that Georgia should recommit to the respect for Iranian tourists. He made the remarks during a meeting with Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili in Tbilisi, after reports began circulating that an Iranian Muslim woman has been forced to take away her hijab by Tbilisi airport security for frisking. Respecting Iranian tourists and treating Muslim women in general, and Iranian women in particular, with dignity is an absolute necessity for the growth of tourism industry in Georgia, Tasnim quoted Zarif as saying. Kvirikashvili expressed surprise when he first learned of such offensive behavior, saying he would order an immediate investigation into the incident. “I cannot imagine that Muslim women are offended in Georgia,” Khabaronline quoted Kvirikashvili as saying. The officials also explored avenues to deepen bilateral ties in various fields, such as banking, agriculture, energy, and construction projects. Georgia and Iran signed an agreement on visa-free travel in November 2010, according to Georgia Today. The agreement came into effect in January 2011 and envisaged reciprocal visa-free travel for up to 45 days for both Georgian and Iranian citizens.
