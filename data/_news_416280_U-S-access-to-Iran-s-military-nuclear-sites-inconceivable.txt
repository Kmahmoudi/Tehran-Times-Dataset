TEHRAN – Alireza Rahimi, a member of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of Iran's Parliament, said on Saturday that U.S. questioning IAEA for Iran’s nuclear activities is an unconventional intervention in the international body’s affairs.

 The Islamic Republic of Iran has informed the Agency of its activities in full transparency and within the framework of the Additional Protocol and all visits from Iran have been in the framework of the Protocol, Rahimi was quoted as saying by Mehr. He added that there are no unannounced visits in this protocol, and all visits to Iran's nuclear facilities have been made within the framework of the IAEA's monitoring protocols. “In this regard, Iran has made necessary cooperation beyond the Agency's expectations and has not committed any breach on the framework of the standards of the Agency,” Rahimi noted, adding any visit to Iran's military sites would need the Islamic Republic of Iran’s permission and the visit to military installations would not be available due to closure of the so-called Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) file. “With the PMD file being closed, there will not be any room for recent U.S. baseless allegations.” The Foreign Ministry has taken timely and constructive positions in this regard; the Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently fulfilled its obligations; U.S. approach is different from the European Union, and it is not constructive, Rahimi underlined, pointing to U.S. historic hostile approach with Iran which would pose threats to the implementation of JCPOA and to the interests of the involving parties. No permission for U.S. access to Iran’s nuclear sites: MP An Iranian lawmaker denounced the U.S. UN envoy’s recent talks with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency on the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, stressing that Iran will never allow the US to have access to or inspect its nuclear facilities. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley’s recent visit to Vienna and her meeting with IAEA Director-General Yukiya Amano wan meant to press the UN nuclear agency for U.S. inspection of Iran’s nuclear facilities, member of the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Mohammad Ebrahim Rezaei told Tasnim. Iran would never permit Americans to visit its nuclear sites, he underlined, Tasnim reported. On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump dispatched Haley to Vienna to press the UN nuclear chief on their reading of Iran’s compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear agreement between Iran and the Group 5+1 (Russia, China, the US, Britain, France and Germany). Thereafter, Iran’s mission to the IAEA issued a statement, saying the objectives and the results of Haley’s trip to Vienna “contradict” the JCPOA and Resolution 2231, which the UN Security Council adopted to endorse the nuclear agreement. In a letter dated August 19 but released on August 23, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned about US lack of adherence to the nuclear deal. Zarif has also said that Haley's visit to the IAEA undermines "the independence and credibility" of IAEA inspectors. (Source: staff and agencies)
