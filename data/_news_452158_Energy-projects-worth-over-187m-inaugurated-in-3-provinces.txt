TEHRAN – Numerous energy projects worth over $187 million were inaugurated in three provinces of Iran on Monday, IRNA reported. In a ceremony attended by the Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian, projects including the establishment of some electricity transmission lines, power stations, and solar plants were inaugurated through video conferences in Yazd and Kerman provinces. Of the mentioned projects, 13 were put into operation in Yazd province central Iran, with a total cost of 2.83 trillion rials (about $67.3 million). Seven projects, including a 400-KV electricity substation, were also inaugurated in the central Kerman province, in which a total of 4.34 trillion rials (about $103.3 million) was invested. Meanwhile, 152 gas supply projects with a total cost of about 700 billion rials (about $16.6 million) were inaugurated in the western Kermanshah province in the presence of Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC)’s Managing Director Hasan Montazer Torbati.
