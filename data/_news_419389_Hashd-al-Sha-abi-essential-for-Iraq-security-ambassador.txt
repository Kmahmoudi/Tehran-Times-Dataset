TEHRAN – Iran’s ambassador to Baghdad has defended the role of the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), better known as Hashd al-Sha’abi, in fighting terrorism in Iraq, saying the force is a “necessity” for the country’s security. “Hashd al-Sha’abi is today a powerful legal organization in Iraq and recognized by the Iraqi government and parliament,” Iraj Masjidi said, Press TV reported on Saturday. Hashd al-Sha’abi, a combination of some 40 groups of mostly Shia fighters, was formed shortly after the emergence of the Daesh terrorist group in Iraq in mid-2014. MH/PA
