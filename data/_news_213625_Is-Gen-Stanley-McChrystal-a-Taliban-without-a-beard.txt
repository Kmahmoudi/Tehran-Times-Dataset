U.S. Gen Stanley McChrystal told the UK's Financial Times newspaper (Jan. 25. 2010) that there had been “enough fighting”.  He said a political solution in all conflicts was “inevitable”. His remarks came as the head of United Nations in Kabul is calling to remove the names of senior Taliban leaders from a UN blacklist as a gesture aimed at encouraging peace negotiations. Richard Holbrooke also said that the Taliban can be part of any future government in Afghanistan.
