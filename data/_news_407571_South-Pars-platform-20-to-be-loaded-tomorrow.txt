TEHRAN- Platform 20 of Iran’s South Pars gas field (in The Persian Gulf) will be loaded at Khorramshahr yard tomorrow for delivery to its designated offshore spot, Shana news agency reported quoting Alireza Ebadi, the operator of South Pars phases 20 and 21 of development. It is the second and last platform of the mentioned phases and has the capacity of producing one billion cubic feet (around 28.3 million cubic meters) of gas per day. 
Platform 21, the first platform of the mentioned phases, was installed on July 29 and will start operation by the end of current Iranian calendar month (November 20), according to Ebdai.
The official said that putting platforms 20 and 21 into operation will add two billion cubic feet (around 57 million cubic meters) of gas per day to the output of South Pars.
South Pars gas field, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate.
