TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Wednesday that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s report on human rights situation in Iran is “invalid”.
 From Iran’s point of view such reports have shortcomings and lack credibility, Qassemi said. “The most serious shortcoming of the report is that the text is based on an unjust, unfair and political resolution which has been prepared against Iran to exert pressure on the country and achieve certain political objectives and this can never have reliability,” he said. He added that the report has been prepared based on unreliable sources. Iran is determined to uphold the people’s rights based on the Islamic principles and the constitution, he said. Ban’s report presents an “unfair, one-sided and wrong judgment” on the situation of human rights in Iran, he added. Elsewhere, Qassemi said that continued adoption of double standards in evaluating the situation of human rights in countries will lead the international community to lose trust in the UN. Ban released a report this week claiming that he remains “deeply troubled” by accounts “of executions, floggings, arbitrary arrests and detentions, unfair trials, denial of access to medical care and possible torture and ill-treatment” in Iran.
