TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that certain Muslim governments have been betraying their nations by helping the U.S. to actualize its policies in the region.
 Receiving participants at an international Qur’an competition in Tehran, the Leader said, “Those regional countries, which implement the U.S. policies in the region, are in fact betraying their people and the Islamic Ummah, paving the way for the American influence.” Leader says, “Those regional countries which implement the U.S. policies in the region, are in fact betraying their people and the Islamic Ummah, paving the way for the American influence.” Referring to the faith and resistance of the Iranian nation against the overambitious U.S., the Leader saw arrogant powers’ fear of the nation as originating from its Islamic-based clout. “Enemies are panicked by the mighty and courageous Islam,” he noted. Powerful Islamic Ummah hushes arrogant powers, keeps Palestine in spotlight Pointing to haughty powers’ attempts and plots to damage Islam and the Islamic Ummah, Ayatollah Khamenei noted, “They (enemies) are aware that Muslims cannot be suppressed if they are powerful, and the Palestine issue will not be consigned to oblivion.” Ayatollah Khamenei also warned the Islamic world against being deceived by arrogant powers’ promises and afraid of their threats. “Today, the most important duty of the Islamic Ummah, particularly the ulema, the enlightened, and the educated of the Islamic countries is to struggle for enlightenment and explanatory Jihad about the facts of the Islamic world.” Elsewhere in his remarks, the Supreme Leader branded the U.S. as “the major Taghut and the Great Satan,” saying Daesh and other Takfiri groups follow an ideology rooted in “Wahhabism” which is preached by Saudi clerics and tolerated and even supported by its rulers.
