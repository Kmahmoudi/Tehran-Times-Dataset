TEHRAN - Shireen Tahmaasb Hunter, a professor of political science at Georgetown University, tells the Tehran Times that “The United States is trying to get Saudi Arabia to help it in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict, and also it wants to get as much economic and financial advantage from it as possible.” Professor Hunter also says that “Talks about nuclear cooperation between the two governments are related to these issues.” She also adds that “Most likely any agreement on Saudi nuclear plans would be along the lines of the JCPOA.” Following is the text the interview: Q: After few years, U.S. administration announced will nuclear agreement with Riyadh. Why U.S. convinced to restart negotiation for nuclear agreement? A: The United States is trying to get Saudi Arabia to help it in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict, and also it wants to get as much economic and financial advantage from it as possible. Talks about nuclear cooperation between the two governments are related to these issues. However, there could be resistance in the U.S. Congress to providing Saudi Arabia with nuclear know how , especially form Israel's supporters .Although  Israel  wants to cooperate with Saudi Arabia against Iran, it does not want to see it emerge as excessively powerful and a potentially a military challenge to Israel. Q: Two Kingdom’s desire in its nuclear pan are enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium. Will U.S. accommodate the Riyadh in these issues? A: It is difficult to predict whether America will accept Saudi requests. There could be opposition in the Congress. At any rate, America would prefer that it helped in the development of Saudi Arabia's nuclear capabilities rather than leaving it to China and Russia. Q: Some argue that if U.S. do not cooperate with Saudi in its nuclear program, Russia and China may do it and this led to reducing American nuclear influence in the region. What is your opinion?  A: Both China and Russia are eager to increase their influence in the Persian Gulf. Russia also has an economic reason to engage with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Therefore they would be happy to replace America if it refuses to accept Saudi conditions. However, in view of Saudi Arabia’s dependence on American arms and security blanket, if the U.S. strongly opposes Chinese and Russian involvement, most likely Saudi Arabia would not seek Russian or Chinese help. Q: Which model for Saudi’s nuclear plan are likely, JCPOA or U.S. agreement with United Arab Emirates? A: Most likely any agreement on Saudi nuclear plans would be along the lines of the JCPOA. Saudi Arabia has made it clear that it will not accept anything less than what Iran has obtained.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
