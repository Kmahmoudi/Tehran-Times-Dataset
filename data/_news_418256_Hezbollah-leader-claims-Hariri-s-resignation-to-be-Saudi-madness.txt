Lebanese resistance movement of Hezbollah Leader Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah on Sunday blamed the House of Saud regime for Lebanon’s turmoil, however he states that war is not expected to occur in the near future.

Hezbollah chief’s Sunday afternoon speech was also in response to Hariri’s sudden resignation, calling it “Saudi madness.” Nasrallah made the remarks during a meeting with hundreds of people.  “What happened was Saudi madness and we’ll wait and see what happens over the next few days,” Nasrallah said. Nasrallah added that he “doesn’t expect war in the near future, but the next war will be fateful and will decide the balance.” Hariri declared his resignation during a speech in the Saudi capital city of Riyadh. He also stated that he senses a conspiracy to assassinate him. According to Saudi regime newspaper Asharq AL-awsat, Western intelligence officials warned Hariri about an attempt to assassinate him.
