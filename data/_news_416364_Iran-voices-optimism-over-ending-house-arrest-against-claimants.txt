TEHRAN – Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht on Tuesday voiced optimism about steps to resolve the issue of house arrest against opposition leaders who claimed vote rigging in the 2009 presidential election, saying the issue has been raised in meetings of the Supreme National Security Council. Mehdi Karroubi, Mir Hossein Mousavi and his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, were placed under house arrest after they insisted on their claims of vote rigging and called for protests. In a press conference on Tuesday, Nobakht confirmed reports that security forces have left Karroubi’s house after he went on a hunger strike.
