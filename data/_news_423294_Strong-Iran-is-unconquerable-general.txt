TEHRAN – A senior advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said on Sunday that a strong Iran is “unconquerable”, IRNA reported. Major General Yahya Rahim-Safavi, who was IRGC chief from 1997 to 2007, said Iran has defeated the U.S. on several occasions and the Americans cannot challenge the great Iranian nation. He further said Iran has managed to foil U.S. plots to undermine the entire region, adding, “It is natural that America should be angry with Iran.” Pointing to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s anti-Iran moves, Rahim-Safavi said, “Who believes that the Zionist regime is not behind the assassination of our nuclear scientists?” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
