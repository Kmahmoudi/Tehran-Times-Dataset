TEHRAN- Petrochemical production in Iran has risen nine percent since the beginning of current Iranian calendar year (March 21) compared to the same period of time in the past year, according to Ali-Mohammad Bossaqzadeh, the production control director of National Petrochemical Company (NPC). The official put the country’s petrochemical output at 31 million tons since the start of this year, Shana reported on Thursday. Iran produced 51 million tons of petrochemicals in the past Iranian calendar year, Bossaqzadeh has previously announced, saying that the figure is estimated to reach 56 million tons by the end of this year (March 20, 2018). Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the 13th edition of Iran Petrochemical Forum (IPF), which was held in Tehran on April 22 and 23, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said that the future of Iran’s petrochemical industry is promising after the implementation of the nuclear deal (officially called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which lifted sanction against Iran in January 2016). Given that Iran ranks the first and fourth in the world in terms of gas and oil reserves, respectively, no country enjoys feedstock as much as Iran to develop its petrochemical industry, the minister highlighted.
