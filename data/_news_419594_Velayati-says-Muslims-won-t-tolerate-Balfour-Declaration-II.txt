TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a top foreign policy advisor to the Leader, said on Thursday that Muslims will not tolerate “Balfour Declaration II”, a reference to the recent decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to relocate Washington’s embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds (Jerusalem) and recognize the Holy city as the capital of the Zionist regime. Calling the move a “satanic step”, Velayati emphasized that Islamic nations are united to confront Israel. In an interview with the Arabic-language al-Alam television network, Velayati said the U.S. and Israel are making a “terrible” mistake. The advisor said unlike to the 1917 Balfour Declaration, today Muslims can stand up against the Zionist regime. MH/PA
