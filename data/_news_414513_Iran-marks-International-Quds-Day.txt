TEHRAN - Defying hot weather Iranians took to the streets in large numbers in different cities on Friday to mark the International Quds Day, demonstrating their alliance with the Palestinians whose lands have been illegally grabbed by the Zionist regime. Officials including the heads of the three branches of government also took part in the rallies. The Quds International Day has turned into campaign against illegal occupation of the Palestinian lands. Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said sympathy with Muslims is Quds Day and not the Saudi blockade of Qatar or the Riyadh summit in May which was attended by Donald Trump. Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan called the “fake Zionist regime” the source of “instability, insecurity, and conflict in the Islamic world”. Salehi Amiri, the minister of culture and Islamic guidance, likened the Israeli regime to a “cancerous tumor” which has caused rift among Muslims. Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said the recent history knows “nothing more evil than the Zionist regime”. Larijani also called Israel the “mother of terrorism”.
