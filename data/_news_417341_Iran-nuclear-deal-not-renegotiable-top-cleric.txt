TEHRAN – Tehran Friday prayer leader Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami has hailed the country’s officials for taking a firm stance against any renegotiation of the nuclear deal, saying Iran will not renegotiate the accord. The U.S. has violated both text and spirit of the nuclear agreement, Khatami said, adding that Washington has left nothing of the deal – officially known has the JCPOA. Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., France, Russia, Britain, China and Germany, signed the JCPOA in July 2015. The deal went into force in January 2016.
