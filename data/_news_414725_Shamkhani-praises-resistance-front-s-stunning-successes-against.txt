TEHRAN – The secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council said on Sunday that Tehran’s advisory role in Syria and Iraq is aimed at supporting the “axis of resistance” and combating terrorism, praising the resistance front’s victories against terrorists in Iraq and Syria. The axis of resistance is an anti-Western and anti-Israeli alliance between Iran, Syria, and the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah. “The axis of resistance’s stunning success in Iraq and Syria showed that security is not a commodity to be bought with petrodollars,” Ali Shamkhani said in open reference to the victories of Syrian and Iraqi security forces against the Wahhabi-inspired terrorists who have been receiving money from certain regional rich countries. Shamkhani who was speaking at the opening ceremony of the general assembly of the Islamic Radio and Television Union (IRTVU) in Mashhad, also said security will be established only through struggle and sacrifice as well as reliance on domestic potentials.  He also called on Islamic media outlets to combat propaganda campaign against the resistance front and to enlighten the world about the realities of Islam. Elsewhere in his remarks, the senior security official warned of U.S. plans for a new Middle East by creating divisions among regional countries. “There is no difference between Democratic or Republican administrations in America when it comes to pursuing plans for a new Middle East aimed at weakening political and geographical potentials and gaining more control over resources and assets in our region,” he remarked. Shamkhani also urged Muslim nations to unite in pursuit of peace and security, noting that all Islamic countries which are pursuing the path of justice should regard the Islamic Republic as their strategic ally which would stand up for them.
