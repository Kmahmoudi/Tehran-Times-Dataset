TEHRAN – Iran has exported handicrafts worth around $200 million since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2016), CHTN reported on Saturday. “The value shows roughly ten percent rise in comparison to the same period in the previous year,” Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization Deputy Director Bahman Namvar-Motlaq said. Exports of handicrafts have been on the increase over the past three years, witnessing an overall 59 percent hike, the official explained.  CHTHO has already announced that highly sought-after handicrafts such as traditional glassware, potteries, ceramics, and kilims (flat tapestry-woven carpets) constitute the lion’s share of exports. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Germany are the main importers of Iranian handicrafts. Some $28.970 billion worth of non-oil goods were exported from Iran during the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year, according to the Iran Customs Administration.
