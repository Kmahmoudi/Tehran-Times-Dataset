TEHRAN – On Wednesday, Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani held talks with President of the Belgium’s Senate Christine Defraigne during which the two sides said banking transactions are necessary for economic ties.
 The president of Belgian Senate arrived in Tehran on Wednesday to hold talks with Iranian officials. Larijani said the visit of European officials to Iran are aimed at expanding economic ties and the realization of this goal entails banking transactions but still some countries are hesitant to resume banking ties with Iran. The July 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and great powers terminates all financial and economic sanctions on Iran, however some banks are still hesitant to resume transactions with Iran, fearing a punishment by the United States. The Iranian parliament speaker said Iran and Belgium enjoy long history of relationship but the ties suffered a setback during the sanctions time on the Islamic Republic. The top parliamentarian also said the next Majlis will try to establish a parliamentary friendship group with Belgium as soon as possible. The next Iranian parliament will start its work on May 28. The second round of parliamentary election will be held on Friday. Defraigne said Iran-Belgium ties dates back to 150 years and this is the “best reason” for her trip to Tehran. She also congratulated Iran for the successful holding of parliamentary election on February 26, wishing the runoff election will also be held successfully. She added that her country is small but it is very influential as it was one of the main architects of the European Union and now it plays a good role in the 28-member bloc. Defraigne also said facilitating banking ties are key to expanding economic ties. “We as legislative power will make necessary recommendations in this regard because we know that facilitating banking transactions are key to economic ties,” Defraigne said, according to a translation of her remarks. Talking to reporters in a joint press conference, Larijani said the cooperation between Tehran and Brussels have been relatively good, yet economic relations can be expanded and called for removing hurdles in this regard. Larijani also highlighted the importance of close parliamentary ties between the two countries. Defraigne also told reporters that Belgium is determined to expand parliamentary ties with Iran. She also said that an international cooperation is required to fight terrorism. “We should fight terrorism seriously because its fallouts have inflicted (some) European countries,” she noted. The top senator added if terrorism is not tackled “there is a concern that such horrible acts happen in the future.” NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
