Are you bored of traffic jam and turmoil of urban life? The city of Yazd, central Iran, with its garden paths is the best choice to be fresh again!

 In July 2017, the city, was registered on the UNESCO World Heritage list. As the Lonely Planet describes it, the city has a fascinating history most notable for its reputation along the caravan routes as a silk weaving center. With its winding lanes, forest of badgirs, mud-brick houses and delightful places to stay, Yazd is a ‘don’t miss’ destination. On a flat plain ringed by mountains, the city is wedged between the northern Dasht-e Kavir and southern Dasht-e Lut and is every inch a city of the desert.  It may not have the big-ticket sights of Isfahan or Shiraz, but, with its atmospheric alleyways and centuries of history, it exceeds both in its capacity to enchant. Yazd warrants a lazy approach – rambling around the maze of historic lanes (referred to locally as Yazd’s ‘historical texture’), popping into random teahouses or pausing to work out calligraphic puzzles in the city’s exquisite tilework. Under tourists’ eyes Here is a select of comments that visitors to the bridge have posted to TripAdvisor, one of the most popular travel websites in the world: Beautiful doors We wandered around the old town last night about 6.30 pm and it was s bit deserted. Quite a few hotels but not much else was open. 
The best bit was all the beautiful old doors. (Jennifer R from Australia; visited September 2017) about Old TownSydney,  Adobe walls, badgir, heat According to locals, Yazd is the second hottest city in Iran. If you comet to Yazd, you will definitely walk around old town but be aware, it is very hot, you need to take bottles of waters in summer when wander around. Even in heat, you will be fascinated by old town... continuous adobe walls which makes the whole town brown and dry, interesting badgir and so on. 
(Hino from Japan; visited September 2017) A place to literally but excitingly get lost I didn’t know that getting lost in an old city could be so exciting until I literally got lost in old town of Yazd. Since it was Ramadan, very few people was around. So, when you’re visiting this spot outside Ramadan, I could imagine it would be like Amazing Race in the Old Town of Yazd. 
(Denpasar from Indonesia; visited August 2017) Great atmosphere. Feels like going back in time I started my walk just before the sun began to set. The golden light gave the place a wonderful glow. I made it to the Tourist Library when the sun was setting. I got to the rooftop for a good view and then resume my walk later. I think the sunset view would be better in the Art House Cafe, but there were a lot of people. 
(Stephen C from Canada; June 2017) Stunning desert city It was truly love at first sight on our first visit to Yazd. Be it wandering around the old town, experiencing the famous Persian hospitality to late night koshti (Iranian wrestling).
