TEHRAN- Exports of goods via railway increased 55% in Iran during the first ten months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2016-January 20, 2017)compared to the same period of time in the previous year, railway official, Hossein Ashouri, told Mehr news agency. Railway should account for 30 percent of freight transportation in Iran by the end of the country’s Sixth Five-Year National Development Plan (2021), IRNA quoted Saeid Mohammadzadeh, the managing director of Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRIR), as saying on January 11.
Iran’s parliament has passed a bill, allowing the administration to allocate one percent of oil and gas revenues annually for railways development projects across the country.
The sum is estimated to be about $1 billion and will be disbursed over the Sixth National Development Plan, ISNA quoted Saeed Rasouli, the deputy director of the IRIR, as saying in early January. MA/MG
