TEHRAN -- Two drug rehabilitation centers, one for mothers with their children and the other for addicts under the age of 18, were established in Tehran on Tuesday.
 One of the centers, which is the first of its kind in the country, is for mothers suffering from severe drug addiction and their children. “The center gives children the chance to be with their mothers,” labor minister Ali Rabiei said during the opening ceremony. Supported by a NGO named Rebirth Society, the center hosts drug addicted mothers with their children who are below six years old. The center has the capacity for 40 mothers with their children and covers treatment costs of up to 12 million rials (about 3,000 dollars) per capita, the managing director of Rebirth Society Abbas Deilamizadeh announced in a press release. The center also holds workshops to empower mothers and teach them skills to earn their living. He expressed his hope over the increase of such centers across the country. Meanwhile, the State Welfare Organization inaugurated a rehabilitation center for drug addicts below 18 years old. “The center hosts teens who become addicted due to their family problems and environmental challenges,” SWO official Mohsen Roshanpajooh said in a press release. “The center accommodates 25 persons, providing patients with treatment periods from three months to six months to go through detox stages,” he explained. “Children who have their own families are treated at their homes and others are taken care of at the center,” he explained.
