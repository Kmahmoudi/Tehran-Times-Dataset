TEHRAN – The Iranian ambassador to Moscow has said Tehran has not held any talks with Russia on purchase of S-400 missiles.

 However Iran is interested in military ties with Russia, Mehdi Sanai told the Russian-language weekly Аргументы и Факты in an interview published on Friday. He hailed last year’s S-300 missile delivery to Iran as a giant step in bilateral military relations. “We are even interested in cooperation in areas which need permission from the United Nations Security Council,” Sanai stated.
