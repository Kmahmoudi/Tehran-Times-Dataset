TEHRAN – Two presidential candidates in separate statements on Monday voiced concern over unbridled import of goods into Iran as the root cause of many economic problems.

 “They have made the country a bed for Chinese goods,” Ebrahim Raisi told the IRIB. “Average annual import from China stood at $5 billion in the 8 years before the 11th (sitting) government, but now it stands at $10 billion.” Mostafa Mirsalim also said unbridled import is the result of “mismanagement”.
