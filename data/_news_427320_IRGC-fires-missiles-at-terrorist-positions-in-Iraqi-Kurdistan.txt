TEHRAN – In a statement released on Sunday, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) confirmed it had targeted positions of a terrorist group in the Iraqi Kurdistan with seven short-range surface-to-surface missiles, warning the terrorists that their repeated evil acts will be faced with a more severe response. “The sons of the Iranian nation in Sepah (IRGC) and other armed forces as well as intelligence and security bodies are determined to protect the borders of the Islamic Iran,” the IRGC said. The IRGC added that its forces had targeted bases of the “filthy and criminal group” in retaliation for their evil acts. It also said during the operation, a meeting of the leaders of the terrorists and a terrorist training center were bombed, and the “center of conspiracy” against the Islamic Republic was destroyed. “Tens of leaders and major operational elements of the group were also killed and wounded in the operation.” The operation was carried out by the missile unit of the IRGC aerospace division with participation of the drone unit of IRGC ground force, the statement said. It further said that over the past months, terrorist groups affiliated with the hegemonic powers have taken hostile moves from inside the Iraqi Kurdistan against Iran’s border areas, with several terrorist teams having been dispatched to Iran to conduct terrorist attacks to endanger the security of Iran’s western provinces of West Azerbaijan, Kurdistan and Kermanshah. But thanks to the IRGC’s vigilance and preparedness, the statement added, a number of operations were conducted during the past weeks which dealt heavy blows to the terrorists in the Marivan and Kamyaran border regions. The IRGC says leaders of the terrorist groups did not heed the serious warnings from the Iraqi Kurdistan’s authorities about Iran’s determination to destroy their bases and about the need for an end to their aggressive and terrorist activities. The IRGC went on to say that heads of the terrorist groups did not heed the serious warnings from the Iraqi Kurdistan’s authorities about Iran’s determination to destroy their bases and about the need for an end to their aggressive and terrorist activities. The so-called Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) told the AFP news agency on Saturday that its organization was holding a meeting at the time of the attack. "Eleven KDPI members were killed and 30 wounded by Katyusha rockets fired on their headquarters in Koysinjaq," Kamran Abbas, director of the city's hospital, told AFP. In another statement on Friday, the IRGC said its forces had killed six members of the PJAK terrorist team that had attacked a border post in Iran’s western province of Kurdistan back in July. According to the statement by the IRGC Ground Force’s Hamzeh Seyyed al-Shohada Base, the PJAK-affiliated terrorist team was ambushed and attacked by the Iranian forces after a complicated intelligence operation in the Kamyaran region. During the ambush, six terrorists were killed, a number of others were wounded and some escaped, the statement added.
