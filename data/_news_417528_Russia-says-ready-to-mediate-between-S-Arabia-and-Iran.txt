Russia is ready and willing to mediate in establishing relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov has stated. "We tried several times and offered [to help Iran and Saudi Arabia sit down at the negotiating table], but we do not impose our intermediary role," Bogdanov told reporters. â€œBut we have always told our partners in both Saudi Arabia and Iran that we are ready to provide both a platform for contacts and friendly services." Bogdanov added that Moscow has always highlighted the need to resolve the issues between the two countries. "Many problems would have been much easier to resolve had there been mutual understanding and trust between Tehran and Riyadh," Bogdanov remarked. He added that the situation in the entire region, especially regarding antiterrorism efforts, depends on mutual understanding and cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Bogdanov stressed that Russia always tells Saudi Arabia and Iran that it is ready to report something from one side to another or to organize their bilateral contacts. "These proposals remain on the table both with our Saudi and Iranian partners." (Source: RT) All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
