TEHRAN – China’s September oil imports from Iran increased 59 percent from the same month a year earlier, Reuters reported citing the country’s customs data. The country Shipped in about 784,060 barrels per day (bpd) or 3.22 million tons of Iranian crude in September, compared with 1.9 million tons in the same period in 2016. As reported, traders with knowledge of Iran’s oil sales said the hefty growth was spurred by resumption of condensate lifting and as Chinese firms lifted more oil from joint venture productions in Iran. Russia held on to its position as China’s top crude oil supplier ahead of Angola and Saudi Arabia for the seventh straight month in September, with shipments hitting a record as refiners rushed to buy lower-sulfur oil to meet cleaner fuels standards. The imports of Iranian oil by four major Asian buyers jumped 81 percent in August from a year earlier, the biggest percentage gain since April 2014, as the producer recoups market share from rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
