TEHRAN – Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis said on Wednesday praised Iran’s support for the Syrian people and government, noting that Iran has been the “best supporter” of Syria in the most difficult times.
 Khamis made the remarks during a meeting in Damascus with Ayatollah Mohsen Araki, secretary general of the World Forum for Proximity of Islamic Schools of Thought.

Ayatollah Mohsen Araki also predicted that the Syrian government and people will win the battle against terrorists soon. A new important chapter, which will be “promotion of true Islam” will be opened in the history of Syria after the victory over terrorism, the ayatollah remarked.  The top cleric said religious scholars shoulder heavy responsibility in presenting a true image of Islam to the world. He added, “Syria can take fundamental steps in promoting true Islam and Islamic unity and become a role model for the world of Islam in this respect.” Ayatollah Araki held a separate meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem during which he said that Syria has many capacities to serve the world of Islam.
