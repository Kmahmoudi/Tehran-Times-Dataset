TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Thursday that there will be no meeting between Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his American counterpart Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York, ISNA reported. Earlier, AFP had quoted “diplomats” as saying that Tillerson would hold a first meeting on the Iran nuclear deal with Zarif and other parties to the 2015 agreement. Zarif will attend the UN General Assembly next week and will hold talks with counterparts from a number of countries, Qassemi said.
