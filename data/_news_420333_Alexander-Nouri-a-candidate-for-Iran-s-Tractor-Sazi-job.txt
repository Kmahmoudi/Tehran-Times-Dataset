TEHRAN - Iranian-German coach Alexander Nouri is a nominee to replace Yayha Golmohammadi in Iranian top-flight team Tractor Sazi. It seems Tractor Sazi are now seriously considering parting company with Golmohammadi as soon as possible. Tractor Sazi will represent Iran in the 2018 AFC Champions League and are aiming to progress to the knockout stages for the first time. The Tabriz-based team are 11th in Iran Professional League, 23 points behind Persepolis at the top of the table. They have reportedly negotiated with former Galatasaray coach Mustafa Denizli and the Turkish coach has confirmed he is interested in coaching the Iranian team. Now, a strong contender comes to the stage. Alexander Nouri parted company with Werder Bremen in late October after failing to win any of their opening 10 Bundesliga matches. He was appointed as the head coach of Werder Bremen in September 2016. Under the helm of Nouri, Bremen escaped the relegation battle and went in contention for European football. He played professionally for 14 years with Werder Bremen, Seattle Sounders Uerdingen 05, VfL Osnabr√ºck, Holstein Kiel and VfB Oldenburg.
