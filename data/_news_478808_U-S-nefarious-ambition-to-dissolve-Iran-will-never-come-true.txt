TEHRAN - In light of the recent violent acts in certain cities in Iran, the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) on Thursday emphasized national resolve to scuttle U.S. and Western plots against the Islamic Republic. Washington wants to incite more unrest and see Iran fall apart, but its mischievous dreams will in no way be realized, Major General Hossein Salami said in a ceremony honoring martyrs of Qom province during the Sacred Defense in the 1980s. Referring to the most recent riots in Iran and the West's persistent backing for the turmoil, Salami added, “We are currently witnessing a political arrangement on the world stage, with the U.S., Britain, Germany, France, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and others having come to fight on the wicked front.” Noting that a "great plot" has been hatched against Iran, he said, “The U.S. likes to see our streets smoke-filled and on fire; it likes us not to send spaceships to the sky; it likes us to be needy, poor and crippled. It would like our patients not to have access to medicine.” He added, "The U.S. likes to split our nation, it likes to dissolve Iran." The major general also said Washington enjoys seeing Iranian youths being killed on the street. However, Salami said, "These terrible aspirations will never come true. The Iranian nation is unwavering." After the death of Mahsa Amini in mid-September, riots erupted in certain cities in Iran. The 22-year-old fell at a Tehran police station and died three days later in hospital. According to an official report issued by the Forensic Medicine, Amini's death was caused by a chronic disease rather than suspected blows to the skull or other key bodily organs. Despite the findings about Mahsa’s death, the rioters, backed by foreigners, have gone on rampage, violently assaulting security personnel. The United States and the United Kingdom were "actively" involved in the turmoil, Iran's Intelligence Ministry said. It has been reported that hundreds of terrorists connected to the Israeli regime and anti-revolutionary organizations have been arrested in the riots. The violent riots have paved the ground for terrorist activities. For instance, on October 26 a terrorist with ties to Daesh assaulted the Shah Cheragh shrine in Shiraz killing 13 pilgrims, among them a woman and two children. Later, the Iranian intelligence ministry declared that its security forces had detained 26 Takfiri terrorists for their involvement in the incident. The statement stated that the detainees were citizens of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Azerbaijan. Also, seven people were killed on Wednesday as terrorists opened fire at shoppers and security personnel at a busy market in Izeh, a city in the southwestern province of Khuzestan. It happened just before dusk. Among the martyrs were a nine-year-old child and a 45-year-old mother. Two of the wounded, totaling at least 9, are in critical condition. In the meantime, rioting in Semirom, a city in central province of Isfahan, resulted in the deaths of three security personnel and injury of eight others. In the city of Malekshahr, also in Isfahan province, two security forces were slain and two others were injured.
