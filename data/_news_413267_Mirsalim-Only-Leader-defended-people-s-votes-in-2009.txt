TEHRAN – Presidential candidate Mostafa Mirsalim said on Monday that after the debated 2009 presidential election, only one man defended people’s votes, that person being Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On the house arrest of the protest leaders, he said the house arrest is in their favor and “it would be detrimental to them if they are put to trial.”  “The claim that year election was rigged was wrong and I had warned Hashemi (Rafsanjani),” he added, according to IRIB.
