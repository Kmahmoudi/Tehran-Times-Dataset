TEHRAN – A new initiative will offer eligible artisans to set up their own workshops and market stalls at historical and touristic places across Qazvin province. The scheme, devised by Qazvin province’s cultural heritage department general, pursues an objective of empowering craftspeople and promoting their skills which have been handed down from generation to generation, Mehr reported on Tuesday. A top tourist destination, Qazvin, the capital city of the province, is filled with centuries-old mosques, caravansaries, madrasas, pubic bathhouses and bazaars amongst others. It was used to be the capital of the Persian Empire under Safavids from 1548 to 1598.
