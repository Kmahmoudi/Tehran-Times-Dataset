TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi condemned on Friday a suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan.
 “Terrorist perpetrators pass all the ideological and moral boundaries and seek to undermine security and shed the innocent people’s blood,” Qassemi stated. He added, “Following extremist terrorists’ heavy defeats, especially of Daesh in Iraq and Syria, this terrorist group has put on the agenda to undermine security in other countries. Terrorist attacks in Afghanistan shows that the innocent Afghan people are one of their targets.” The Foreign Ministry official also said that “the Afghan and all the peace-seeking governments and people” should raise awareness in line with fighting terrorism. A suicide bomber and gunmen attacked a Shia mosque in Kabul on Thursday and killed at least four people. Daesh claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, the suicide bomber was barred from entering al-Zahra mosque in western Kabul and detonated his explosives in a kitchen outside the prayer hall. A huge bomb blast in Kabul in May killed at least 90 people and injured 300 others. Daesh was responsible for the attack.
