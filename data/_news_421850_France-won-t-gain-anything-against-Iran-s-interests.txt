TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Velayati, a top foreign policy adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, said on Tuesday that the visiting French foreign minister won’t gain anything against Iranian people’s interests. “The French foreign minister visited Iran at the official invitation of his Iranian counterpart, and certainly, our officials have explained the Islamic Republic of Iran's views to him,” Velayati told reporters in Tehran on Tuesday. He also said the White House is planning to impose defense restrictions on Iran, but the Iranian nation and government will never concede, Mehr reported.
