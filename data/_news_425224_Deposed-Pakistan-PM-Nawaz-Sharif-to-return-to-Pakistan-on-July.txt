TEHRAN -The deposed Pakistani Prime Minister, who was handed 10 years rigorous jail term by an accountability court in Pakistan last week in Panama Papers scandal, is expected to return to Pakistan on July 15 to face the charges. Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz, who also faces 7 years jail term in the same case, said in a Twitter post that they will return to Lahore, their hometown and political stronghold. Sharif and his children have been in London since June attending to Sharif’s ailing wife who is undergoing treatment for cancer. After the verdict was announced last week, Sharif had said he would return to Pakistan to “face prison”. Referring to the court sentence, he said he was being punished for turning the course of Pakistan's 70-year history. “I promise that I will continue this struggle until Pakistanis are free of the chains that they are kept in for saying the truth,” Nawaz said. “I will continue my struggle till the people of Pakistan are freed from the slavery imposed on them by some generals and judges,” he added. Meanwhile, according to sources, preparations are underway for the father-daughter duo to address rallies across the country upon their arrival. Pakistan goes to polls on July 25. The verdict has come as a big jolt to Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) ahead of elections. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
