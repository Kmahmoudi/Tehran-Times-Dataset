TEHRAN – Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the man who was Iran’s point man for the Arab world for some years, said on Monday that he had warned the Saudi foreign minister that the Riyadh committed a “strategic mistake” in waging a war on Yemen, but al-Jubeir posed victoriously.   “I explicitly told him (during a meeting) that the military aggression in Yemen is the new strategic mistake of Riyadh which will bring more insecurity both to the region and Saudi Arabia, but he arrogantly told me that they would achieve victory in Yemen,” said Amir-Abdollahian, former Iranian ambassador to Bahrain and incumbent parliament’s general director for international affair. 
The Saudi kingdom waged a war on Yemen in March 2015 after Mansur Hadi resigned and fled to Saudi Arabia. The war has left millions of the Yemeni people displaced and thousands dead. 
“Saudis by encouraging Mansur Hadi to resign, began the policy of ‘stateless Yemen’ and today, in continuation of their many mistakes, they have put on agenda the policy of waging and escalating civil war in Yemen,” the Iranian official said. 
“[Yet], the Yemeni people stood up against the aggression courageously and made history,” he added, highlighting that Saudis have been trapped in the Yemeni quagmire.   AK/PA
