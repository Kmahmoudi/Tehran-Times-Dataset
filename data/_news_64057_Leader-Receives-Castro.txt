Castro, during his short stay in Iran, has also met with high-ranking Iranian officials. His visit to the Islamic Republic, has had worldwide coverage by the media. The Turkish newspapers on Wednesday, gave slanted headlines to his visit. Some of these dailies described the warm welcome accorded by President Mohammad Khatami to the Cuban leader as "sincere friendship between opponents of the United States." The daily *** Milliyet *** wrote that Castro praised Iran's struggle against the U.S. imperialism. Another Turkish newspaper *** Cumhuriyet *** said that Islamic Iran and communist Cuba are linked by their common opposition to the United States. *** Sabah *** quoted Castro as saying that he was attracted by Iran's unflinching stand with regard to the United States. Still, another daily wrote that Iran and Cuba, as two major opponents of Washington, have joined hands. However, the most interesting reaction came from the Persian Service of the Voice of America. The commentator of the service wondered how it was possible for an Islamic country to have relations with a communist state. But what this speaker intentionally ignored was the common background of the two countries as flag-bearers of resistance against the U.S. hegemony and domination, and the fact that both countries have toppled their pro-Western regimes and established independent and sovereign governments instead. These are the major factors that link Islamic Iran and socialist Cuba very closely together. Commenting on the importance of Castro's visit to Iran, Sabah Zangeneh, advisor to Iranian foreign minister, said that the visit was quite significant, since the two countries share similar views on some basic issues such as their independence, sovereignty and resistance against certain arrogant powers. He also said that the two countries play a very important role in Group 77 and Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) due to their determination to prepare the ground for a free and respectful life for the Third World nations. Fidel Castro was awarded an honorary doctorate here Tuesday as he was touring Iranian University of Tarbiat Modarres. He also toured renowned Tehran University yesterday. Meanwhile he met with the executives of a joint Iran-Cuba biotechnological project for the production of pharmaceutical drugs, Castro said that the two countries' cooperation in scientific field could produce "fruitful results." He said that the exchange of scientific findings between Iran and Cuba, given economic benefits involved, is a high priority in the two countries' cooperation. The 74-year-old Cuban leader, leading a large delegation of officials and businessmen, arrived here Monday night on his first-ever visit to Tehran for a three-day stay. His trip to the Islamic Republic is mainly aimed at expanding ties between the two nations, in addition to the future of the G-77 group of developing nations, whose presidency is currently held by Tehran. So far, Castro has held talks with President Mohammad Khatami and Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi and Head of the Expediency Council, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. He is scheduled to meet with Iran's Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The two countries have always enjoyed strong cordial relations and Cuba has always backed the Islamic Republic's stances in the international scenes, especially on issues related to human rights.
