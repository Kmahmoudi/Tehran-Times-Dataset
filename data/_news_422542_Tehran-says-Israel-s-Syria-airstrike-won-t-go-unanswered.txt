TEHRAN – A top Iranian politician said on Tuesday that a recent Israeli airstrike on an airbase in Syria will not escape a proper response. Ali Akbar Velayati said the crimes committed by the Zionists against the Syrian forces at the T-four Airbase “will not remain unanswered”. Remarks by Velayati came on the same day when remains of seven Iranian military advisors who were killed on Monday during Israel’s raid against the airbase in the Homs region were returned to Iran. On Monday morning, the airbase was attacked by two Israeli F-15 jets. The missiles were fired from Lebanese airspace with media reports suggesting eight missiles were launched in total, five of which were intercepted by Syrian air defense systems. The attack at the airbase, located 40km west of Palmyra, killed and wounded several people, Syrian state news agency SANA reported.
