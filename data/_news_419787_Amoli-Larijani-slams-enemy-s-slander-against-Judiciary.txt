TEHRAN – Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani said on Wednesday that the enemy’s vicious slander on the Judiciary is because of its crucial role in fighting corruption. “The enemy knows that if the Judiciary is independent and powerful, it can prevent infiltration and sabotage,” Amoli Larijani said, adding this is why the enemy casts doubt on the rightfulness of the country’s judicial authorities. He also said the country’s laws will be applied to each and every individual in order to guarantee a fair legal environment, emphasizing that the Judiciary will continue to play its role in full power.   MH/ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
