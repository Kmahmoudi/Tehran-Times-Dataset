TEHRAN – The Iranian Nanotechnology Initiative Council (INIC) plans to expand market for Iranian nanomedical devices, the INIC secretary general told Mehr on Saturday. Saeed Sarkar said that INIC supports nanomedical devices to earn CE marking, a certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA). The certificate is very important for expanding market in Europe, he said. INIC reimburses half of expenses by knowledge-based companies for earning CE, Sarkar announced.  He added the ceiling for reimbursement is 400 million rials (about 9.5 thousand dollars). Iran’s medical device market is estimated to be worth about €2 billion and Iran’s production market share is only 30 percent, he said. The council also supports nano companies which have afforded 80 percent of expenses for earning ISO 13485 and expenses up to 200 million rials (about 4,700 dollars) for obtaining CE, the official added. The council aims to develop market for products made by knowledge-based companies and to facilitate exporting of the items, he said.  Iran has already exported nano products to over 45 countries, he added. In Iran, about 170 nanotechnology companies produce over 420 nano products in the different fields including healthcare, textile, home appliances, energy and laboratory equipment, INIC official Reza Assadifard told IRNA in mid-June 2018.
