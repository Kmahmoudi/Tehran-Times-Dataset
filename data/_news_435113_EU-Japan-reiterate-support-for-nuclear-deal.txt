The European Union (EU) and Japan on Thursday reiterated their joint support for the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 “We reiterate our joint support for the Iran/Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” said a statement issued after the 26th summit between the EU and Japan in Brussels, according to Xinhua. U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled Washington out of the 2015 nuclear deal in May 2018 and ordered reimposition of sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. Also, on Monday the U.S. announced that Washington has decided not to extend waivers allowing major importers to continue buying oil from Iran when they expire in early May. On January 31, France, Germany and Britain announced the creation of INSTEX, a special purpose vehicle aimed at facilitating legitimate trade between European economic operators and Iran. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said INSTEX will support legitimate European trade with Iran. Japan has repeatedly expressed support for keeping the JCPOA. Japanese Ambassador to the Vienna-based international organizations Mitsuru Kitano tweeted in May, “At the @iaeaorg Board of Governors meeting, I made a statement on Iran’s nuclear issues. “Japan continues to firmly support the JCPOA, as it strengthens the international non-proliferation regime and contributes to the peace and stability of the Middle East region.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
