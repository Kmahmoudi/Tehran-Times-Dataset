TEHRAN – Emergency projects commenced on Monday aiming to protect several historical and heritage sites which suffered damages during an earthquake that jolted the western province of Kermanshah on November 12. A comprehensive restoration program should be implemented after gaining approval from technical committee of the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization, CHTHO Deputy Director Mohammad-Hassan Talebian was quoted as saying by CHTN. Talebian made the remarks during an inspection of damaged heritage sites across Kermanshah province on Sunday. “These historical monuments are very important in terms of regional identity. Some of them are faced with problems that may get into worse situations if not addressed urgently.” The powerful 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck western Iran and eastern Iraq. It slightly damaged some historical sites including a Safavid-era caravanserai, and a Sassanid-era fortress in the counties of Qasr-e Shirin, Sarpol-e Zahab and Dalahu in Kermanshah province. Based on earlier reports, UNESCO-registered sites of Bisotun and Taq-e Bostan went unhurt.
