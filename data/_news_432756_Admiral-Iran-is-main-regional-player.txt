TEHRAN – Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, the deputy army chief for coordination affairs, said on Wednesday that Iran is the main player in the West Asia region.
 “Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran is the main player in the region and no country can take an action in the region without Iran’s presence or decision,” he said in a conference held at the Holy Defense Museum. He also said Iran is a source of “inspiration” to independent countries. “We had no such a status in the international system before the revolution. Today, no one can deny status of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he added. However, former commander of the Iranian Navy said, there are threats against the growth of the Islamic Revolution. “We should answer to two questions. One is that what we have done that we have attained such achievements, and another is that what we should do to counter the current soft war and economic war which have been started against our country,” the military official noted. In May 2018 U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the international 2015 nuclear deal and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. This happened despite the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly confirmed Iran’s full compliance to the nuclear treaty.
