TEHRAN – Calligrapher and painter Javad Bakhtiari hopes that Iranian ambassadors will emulate the successful experience of the South Korean envoy in organizing art shows at his official residence in Tehran. Last Friday, South Korean Ambassador Kim Seung-ho organized an exhibition of Persian calligraphy works by Iranian artist Bakhtiari at his residence. “This is a unique event that a center, which is mainly for diplomatic affairs, organizes with works by an artist from the host country,” Bakhtiari told the Persian service of MNA on Sunday. “The exhibition, though it was held for one day, will have positive results in the cultural and even in political areas,” he noted. He said that the exhibition was warmly received and achieved good sales. According to Bakhtiari, most of the visitors were from companies that have economic relations with South Korea.  Bakhtiari is the second Iranian artist who was selected to showcase his works at Seung-ho’s residence. Earlier in April, paintings by Masih Mirhosseini were put on display at the house. Seung-ho has said that he aims to promote friendship between Iran and his country by organizing such exhibitions.
