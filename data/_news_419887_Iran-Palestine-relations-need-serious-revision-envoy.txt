Lauding the historic relations between the Islamic Republic and the Palestinian Authority (PA), he said “I’m the longest serving ambassador in the Islamic Republic. I’ve been in Tehran as ambassador for 37 years.” “I’ve always had close relations with Iranian authorities,” he said, emphasizing that there’s no official in Iran with whom he does not have friendly relations. He thanked Leader of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for his stance on the issues of Palestinians, saying Ayatollah Khamenei will be able to unite Palestinian groups.
