TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry slammed on Monday terrorist blast targeted at a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, which left one person killed and four others wounded.
 Taliban claimed responsibility for the explosion. After the explosion, three armed suicide attackers tried to gain entry into the hotel, but were engaged by police, Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry told CNN. On July 23, twin explosions also occurred through a demonstration by members of Afghanistan’s mainly Shiite Hazara minority in Kabul and left at least 90 people killed and over 230 injured. ISIS took credit for the attack. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, “Terrorism has turned into a ‘common commodity’ in the regional political traders’ market and the international actors and organizations’ tolerance and ignorance about this evil phenomenon will lead to spread of it.” He renewed Iran’s call for fighting the roots of terrorism in the region. He added, “Takfiri terrorism has roots in Wahhabi ideology.”  Wahhabism which is linked to the Saudi regime is the source of institutionalization of terrorism and extremism and this is a threat against international security, the spokesman noted. He also said that fight against terrorism will not be possible without international determination. NA/PA
