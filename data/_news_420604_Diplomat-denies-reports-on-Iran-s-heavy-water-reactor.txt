TEHRAN – Fake reports that Iran has poured concrete into the core of its Arak heavy water reactor were fabricated by the “global Zionism” to overshadow the facility modernization plans and downplay Tehran’s benefits from the JCPOA, Iran’s ambassador to London has said. In an article released on Monday, Hamid Baeidinejad, a former nuclear negotiator, described the country’s success to maintain its Arak heavy water reactor and plans to modernize the facility as a “glory of Iran” under the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Tasnim reported.
