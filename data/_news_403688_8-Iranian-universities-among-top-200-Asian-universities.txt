The Times Higher Education World University Rankings are the only global performance tables that judge research-intensive universities across all their core missions: teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. The Asia University Rankings use the same carefully calibrated performance indicators to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons, trusted by students, academics, university leaders, industry and governments, but the weightings are specially recalibrated, based on feedback, to reflect the priorities of Asian institutions. Teaching (the learning environment) with 25 percent, research (volume, income and reputation) with 30 percent, citations (research influence) with 30 percent, international outlook (staff, students and research) and industry income (knowledge transfer) each with 7.5 percent are the five performance indicators used to rank the universities.
