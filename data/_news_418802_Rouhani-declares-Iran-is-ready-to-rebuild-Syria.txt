TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani of Iran on Saturday congratulated his Syrian counterpart Beshar al-Assad over the defeat of Daesh in Syria and Iraq and announced Tehran’s readiness to help reconstruct Syria as the nearly seven-year war in the country is nearing its end.
 “The Islamic republic of Iran is ready to actively participate in the reconstruction process in Syria,” Rouhani said in telephone conversations with Assad. Iran has been on the side of Damascus since the foreign-fueled insurgency started in Syria in late 2011. Rouhani also said certain Western powers and their lackeys initially were thinking that Daesh would succeed to break up either Iraq or Syria and that this sinister group could continue committing crimes and causing destruction in line with their interests. Rouhani went on to say that like the Syrian government and nation, the Iranian nation and government will be “pleased” with every step taken to defeat terrorism. The president also said, “The strategic relationship between Iran and Syria will continue and we will continue moving on the right path in line with the interests of the two nations and other nations in the region.” Rouhani insisted on Tehran’s long-held position that it is the Syrian people who must decide about the future of their country without the interference of foreign states. “…in the next steps the Syrian sovereignty must be stronger than ever so that it can pass this stage easily,” the Iranian president asserted. He also said Iran will be on the side of Syria in making political reforms and suggested that the opposition should have its share in the  future of the country. “We also believe that the Syrian opposition should use this opportunity properly and have a share in the future of Syria on the basis of their status.” In an indirect reference to the scathing remarks against Iran by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, Rouhani said Iran is seeking “peace, stability, brotherly relations and security in the entire region.” Bin Salman, in an interview with the New York Times published on Thursday likened Iran to the Hitler of the Middle East. Rouhani said the “inexperienced” leaders of certain Arab countries “do not speak on the behalf of their people”. Without mentioning bin Salman, Rouhani said it is “strange” that the Saudi crown prince views Iran as an “enemy” and the Zionist regime of Israel as “friend”. “Unfortunately, sometimes inexperienced officials of certain regional countries utter some words which are exactly like the words of the Zionist regime.” For his part, Assad said his country is seeking an active involvement of Iran including the private sector in the reconstruction of his war-ravaged country. He also said, “The Syrian government and people are thankful to the efforts of Iranian people and government (in fighting terrorism).” Assad also said the reasons behind “unwise” and “angry” positions adopted against Iran by certain regional countries, especially those on the Arab League, are because they are unhappy with the defeat of Daesh in Syria and Iraq. The Syrian president added, “The position of the Arab League certainly is not the position of the Arab peoples.”  PA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
