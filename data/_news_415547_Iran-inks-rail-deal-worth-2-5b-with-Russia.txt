Iranian Industry, Mining, and Trade Minister Mohammadreza Nematzadeh and Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi besides Russian Ambassador to Tehran Levan Dzhagaryan were present in the signing ceremony. The two sides had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in this regard during the visit of an Iranian delegation led by IRDO Chairman Mansour Moazzami to Moscow in late March. During the signing ceremony, Moazzami said a joint company will be established by the Iranian and Russian sides, in a way that its shares will be held 80 percent by Russia and 20 percent by Iran.
