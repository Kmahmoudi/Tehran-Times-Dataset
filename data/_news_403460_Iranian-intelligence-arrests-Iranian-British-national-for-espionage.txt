TEHRAN - Iranian intelligence forces have arrested an Iranian-English woman who they said was linked to foreign intelligence services over cyber and media sabotage attempts and national security matters.  Nazanin Zaghari, 37, was arrested by intelligence teams affiliated with the Islamic Republic Guards Corps (IRGC) on April 3 this year in Imam Khomeini International Airport, transferred to Kerman province short after.
A manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Nazanin Zaghari was arrested where she and her daughter, Gabriella, were about to board a flight back to Britain. According to the Guardian, the Guardian reported.
Since her arrest, Zaghari has been held in solitary confinement in an unknown location in the southern province of Kerman while allowed phone calls and visits from her family during the confinement, the report says.
Unlike the report, Zaghari’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe has rejected the allegations, saying it is difficult for him to see how her wife and little girl could pose a threat to Iran’s national security.
“It is hard to understand how a young mother and her small child on holiday could be considered an issue of national security. She has been over to visit her family regularly since making Britain her home,” her husband said in a statement,” he told the Guardian. 
Zaghari’s suit has been referred to Tehran, for further investigations by IRGC intelligence units and some judicial working. 
Although Iran and Britain has not been in good terms historically, over the past 15 years bilateral relations have been plagued by London’s firm stance on Iran’s nuclear program and the ensuing sanctions regimes as well as storming of Britain’s embassy in Tehran in 2011.
However, there have been openings in ties as Tehran forged a deal with the 5+1 group of countries, of which Britain was one, over its nuclear program.
