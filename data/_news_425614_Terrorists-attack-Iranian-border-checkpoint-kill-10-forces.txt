TEHRAN - Anti-revolution terrorists attacked an Iranian military checkpoint on the western border with Iraq on Friday night, killing 10 forces from the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. PJAK, a terrorist group aligned with the PKK, claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement released on Saturday, the IRGC said the overnight attack took place in the village of Dari in the Marivan district, Kurdistan province. The attackers exploded an ammunition, the IRGC stated. The IRGC said that a number of the attackers were also killed in the clash and others injured or fled. “Terrorist and anti-revolution groups and their supporters have no status among the Iranians, especially the great and revolutionary people of Kurdistan, and should wait for a hard revenge,” the statement said.
