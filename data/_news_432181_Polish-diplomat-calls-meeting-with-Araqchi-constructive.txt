TEHRAN - Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Maciej Lang has said that his meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on a joint U.S.-Poland conference on the Middle East was “constructive”.
 “We spoke about a wide range of issues, including misunderstandings about the Warsaw conference, and I presented our point of view on this issue. We had a long discussion and I hope that I did it in a clear way,” Lang told AFP in an interview published on Monday. “For Poland this conference is not against any country,” he said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on January 11 that Warsaw will host a conference that “includes an important element of making sure that Iran is not a destabilizing influence” in the region. The conference is set to be held on Feb. 13-14. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned on January 13 Polish charge d’affaires to Tehran Wojciech Unolt to protest Poland’s bid to co-host the anti-Iran conference. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has described the move as “shameful” in light of the fact that Iran saved Poles during World War II. “Polish Govt can’t wash the shame: while Iran saved Poles in WWII, it now hosts desperate anti-Iran circus,” Zarif tweeted. During the meeting with the Polish diplomat, Araqchi said that Iran will not allow formation of coalition against its interests by any country in or outside the region. Lang said the Warsaw conference “is not against any country including the Islamic Republic of Iran”. He added that Poland considers Iran as an important player in the Middle East and that the aim of the conference is to help resolve problems in the region and “Poland as the friend of Iran will not allow any move against Iran.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
