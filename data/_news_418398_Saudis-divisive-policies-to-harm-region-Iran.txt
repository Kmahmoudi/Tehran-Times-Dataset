TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s “divisive” policies will cause harms to the whole Middle East region.
 “Saudi Foreign Minister [Adel al-Jubeir] makes efforts to divert public opinion from destabilizing acts of Saudi Arabia in the region by distorting realities, which is a fruitless attempt,” Bahram Qassemi said. His comments came upon an interview with the Saudi foreign minister published by CNBC on Thursday in which Jubeir claimed that Iran is responsible for a recent lunch of missile from Yemen on the Saudi capital’s international airport. Qassemi dismissed the Saudi official’s claim and said that Saudi Arabia is the “cradle of extremism” and a “clear example of terrorist acts and interference in other regional countries’ domestic affairs”. He noted that Iran has not spared any effort to help establish stability, security and peace in the region. The Saudi-led coalition fighting against Yemen issued a statement on November 5 accusing Iran of supplying Yemen with the missile launched into Saudi Arabia. Qassemi said on Monday that launch of missile was an “independent act” taken by Yemenis themselves and the reason behind it was Saudis’ aggressions against their country.
