TEHRAN – Iran’s missile power is “by no means negotiable”, Deputy Parliament Speaker Ali Motahari said on Tuesday, ISNA reported. However, Motahari said, the Islamic Republic is open to dialogue on regional issues, including the Syrian and Yemeni crises. On the fate of the nuclear agreement, the lawmaker said the Europeans will have to guarantee that they will confront the United States, otherwise Iran will exit the deal. He made the remarks before U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision on the deal was announced later the same day.
