TEHRAN – The Iranian Judiciary Chief Sadeq Amoli Larijani on Monday called for a “fair” criticism of the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 Amoli Larijani’s call comes days after the first anniversary of the deal and the Foreign Ministry’s briefing of the parliament on the process of the implementation of the agreement.
Opponents say the pact has resulted in almost no economic gains, while Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has labeled the opponent voices as “sanctions beneficiaries.” AK/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
