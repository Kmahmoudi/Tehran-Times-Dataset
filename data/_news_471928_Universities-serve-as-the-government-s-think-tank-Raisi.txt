The Presidential Centre for Strategic Studies, according to Raisi, serves as a link between the government and universities, mentioning some attempts at the center to develop a framework for organized communication between the government and academics. The most essential approach to take care of the country's talented persons, according to the president, is to create hope through practical approaches.  He suggested that students should be treated in a way that they pin hope on the future of the country to prevent brain drain. The president went on to say that there exit precious motivations for the young and students in the country, saying, “Inside the country and at the level of knowledge-based companies and educational centers, attractions should be created so that students and young people feel that they have the fields for research.” Ayatollah Raisi listed the promotion of human sciences as one of the country's top goals, saying, “University is a center for human development and production of science.” “I have repeatedly emphasized in the government that instead of the university following industry, today all executive bodies have a duty to follow the university and work with universities and scientific centers,” the president added.  “Respect for the dignity of professors is very important and both students and management should have such an approach in the university,” stated the president, underlining the importance of Islamic morality and respect for teachers.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
