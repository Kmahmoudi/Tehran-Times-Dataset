TEHRAN – Mark Fitzpatrick, the executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) says despite Washington’s claims, Iran’s missile testing activities do not violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231.

 Fitzpatrick made the statement in a tweet on Saturday after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in a tweet earlier the day that Iran was increasing its "testing and proliferation" of missiles, and called on the Islamic Republic to “cease these activities.”  The test, Pompeo claimed, “violates UNSCR 2231,” citing the Security Council's endorsement of the international nuclear agreement which the United States abandoned in May. In response, Fitzpatrick wrote, “Not to excuse Iran's missile test, but it is not a "violation" of UNSCR 2231, which only "calls upon" Iran not conduct such tests. It also calls all member states to refrain from actions that undermine implementation of JCPOA commitments. So if Iran is in violation so is the US.” Resolution 2231 “calls on” Iran "not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.” Tehran has always insisted that none of its missiles have been designed to carry nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly confirmed Iran's compliance to the accord. Back in May, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the JCPOA despite objections from the other signatories to the nuclear deal. Since then, Washington has imposed “toughest ever” sanctions against Iran. It has also warned of severe penalties for the companies that evade the bans and engage in business with Iran. However, the European parties to the JCPOA have vowed all-out efforts to save the agreement and protect their firms in the face of American bans. They are now working to set up the so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in a bid to circumvent the U.S. sanctions against Iran and facilitate non-dollar trade with Tehran.
