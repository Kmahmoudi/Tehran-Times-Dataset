TEHRAN – A Turkish police officer, who had allegedly maltreated Iranian nationals entering the country, has been fired, ISNA news agency quoted an unnamed Turkish diplomat as saying. The development comes after Iran’s Foreign Ministry formally protested against what it called “disrespect” to Iranian tourists by some Turkish police forces. The objection was motivated by a footage showing an Iranian being beaten by Turkish security guards in Gurbulak, a village in province Agri in eastern Turkey, which is a border checkpoint into Iran.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
