TEHRAN – Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and his Belgian counterpart Bruno van der Pluijm held talks on Wednesday over Tehran-Brussels cooperation on international issues and other issues of mutual interest.   During the meeting held in the Belgian capital Brussels, van der Pluijm underlined the lasting commitment of his country and other European states to save the Iran nuclear deal, saying the nuclear accord plays a key role in international peace and security, the Foreign Ministry website reported. “We are seeking to preserve the Iran nuclear deal and believe that despite the U.S. pullout, the JCPOA should remain intact through our patient and prudent measures because there is no alternative to the 2015 accord,” van der Pluijm stated.
