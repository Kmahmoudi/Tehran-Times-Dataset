Large groups of citizens in the capital Tehran also headed for Azadi Square celebrating the victory of the revolution, IRNA reported. Senior statesmen, military echelons, MPs, seminarians, academia, war veterans, teachers, pupils, sportspersons, Basijis and religious minorities, were among others who proceeded their way from seven major predetermined squares to the Azadi Square. Women had strong presence in Tuesday's rallies. President Mohammad Khatami addressed the citizens on the U.S. unilateralism as well as regional and international issues. Khatami issued a blunt warning to U.S. leaders against supporting Iranian dissidents and exiled opposition. "America has once tried its luck in confronting this nation by supporting the regime of shah, but I hope it will not be under further illusion to support the remnants of the former regime," he told ralliers. On February 11, 1979, the Islamic Revolution rose to victory under the leadership of late Imam Khomeini, which marked the end of the U.S.-backed Pahlavi regime, under Mohammad Reza. "Independence and freedom from the yoke of the aliens have been the 150-year-long will of the Iranian nation over the past and only totalitarian rulers and their associates which used to rule on this country have been opposed to its independence," Khatami said. The Iranian nation are fully united in defending the ideals of the revolution and safeguarding their independence, he said, adding "Any aggressor will face the anger and rejection of all the (Iranian) people". Khatami cited "bigger threats" against independent states, saying "any effort to impose tyrannical policies threatens the independence of all countries". He reverberated Iran's categorical rejection of a probable U.S. attack on Iraq, saying "the Islamic Republic is opposed to any military attack on Iraq". Khatami, however, distanced himself from sounding to support the Iraqi regime which waged an eight-year imposed war against the Islamic republic, leading to massive human and property losses. "Our opposition to any attack on Iraq does not imply that we are content with the Iraqi Regime," he said, adding "A military strike, besides inflicting massive damage to the noble Iraqi people, will lead to tension and insecurity in the region". This year's Bahman 22 (February 11) rallies were of special significance considering the U.S. military buildup in the region under the pretext of disarming Iraq. Dozens of parachutists from the Islamic Republic Air Force's airborne division landed on Azadi Square. Helicopters showered flowers on congregation of masses at the square. Tehrani ralliers said the Islamic Revolution of Iran is the harbinger of peace and friendship and condemned Washington's policies to wage a new war in the region. A 10-point resolution, issued at the end of rallies, also voiced readiness of the Iranian nation, government and armed forces to face the U.S. mischief and threats. The resolution condemned the U.S. "foolish" proposals as well as military buildup in the Persian Gulf by non-Muslim governments. The resolution took the move as a threat to the national security of the Persian Gulf littoral sates. It stressed, "The Persian Gulf belongs to Islam and Muslim nations." The resolution also announced support for the oppressed Palestinian nation in the face of aggressions by the Qods occupying regime, saying the threats stem from the U.S. support. It also condemned the probable war on the oppressed Iraqi people, saying any change in the destiny of Iraq should be made by Iraqi citizens themselves. A group of Iranian officials and foreigners hailed the high public turnout in Bahman 22 rallies, praising achievements of the country in the post-Islamic Revolution. Majlis Speaker Mahdi Karrubi lauded the high public turnout, arguing the show of presence thwarted enemy attempts to paralyze the revolution. "Contrary to the publicity and huge sums of investment by global arrogance and blind-hearted hypocrites (a reference to the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization), our people have through participation in Bahman 22 rallies showcased their unity and cohesion to the world people, nullifying enemy conspiracies," Karrubi told IRNA on the sidelines of the ceremonies. Karrubi hailed Bahman 22 as a national day of unity, independence and strength of iranians, thus deserving to be honored. Former parliament speaker, Hojatoleslam Ali-Akbar Nateq-Nouri, also said in Qom that the strong presence of the public in the demonstrations showed their all-out support for the Islamic establishment and revolution. Nateq-Nouri said people showed they would resist the hegemony of the global arrogance. Substitute Friday prayer leader of Tehran Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani in the southern Island of Qeshm (Hormuzgan Province) praised the mass participation in the ceremony, saying that the huge rallies of Iranian people was hoped to dishearten the enemy and make it knew that it could not do a damn thing against the Iranian nation. The MPs representing Zoroastrians and Armenians as well as a number of other lawmakers too were amazed by the high public turnout in Tuesday's rallies. Zoroastrians' MP Khosrow Dabestani said in an interview with IRNA on Tuesday that Zoroastrians along with many other Iranians were seen in the rallies to prove their will to contribute to the reconstruction of the country.

"Contrary to the publicity and huge sums of investment by global arrogance and blind-hearted hypocrites (a reference to the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization), our people have through participation in Bahman 22 rallies showcased their unity and cohesion to the world people, nullifying enemy conspiracies," Karrubi told IRNA on the sidelines of the ceremonies. Karrubi hailed Bahman 22 as a national day of unity, independence and strength of iranians, thus deserving to be honored. Former parliament speaker, Hojatoleslam Ali-Akbar Nateq-Nouri, also said in Qom that the strong presence of the public in the demonstrations showed their all-out support for the Islamic establishment and revolution. Nateq-Nouri said people showed they would resist the hegemony of the global arrogance. Substitute Friday prayer leader of Tehran Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani in the southern Island of Qeshm (Hormuzgan Province) praised the mass participation in the ceremony, saying that the huge rallies of Iranian people was hoped to dishearten the enemy and make it knew that it could not do a damn thing against the Iranian nation. The MPs representing Zoroastrians and Armenians as well as a number of other lawmakers too were amazed by the high public turnout in Tuesday's rallies. Zoroastrians' MP Khosrow Dabestani said in an interview with IRNA on Tuesday that Zoroastrians along with many other Iranians were seen in the rallies to prove their will to contribute to the reconstruction of the country.
                  The Iranian nation are fully united in defending the ideals of the revolution and safeguarding their independence, he said, adding "Any aggressor will face the anger and rejection of all the (Iranian) people". Khatami cited "bigger threats" against independent states, saying "any effort to impose tyrannical policies threatens the independence of all countries". He reverberated Iran's categorical rejection of a probable U.S. attack on Iraq, saying "the Islamic Republic is opposed to any military attack on Iraq". Khatami, however, distanced himself from sounding to support the Iraqi regime which waged an eight-year imposed war against the Islamic republic, leading to massive human and property losses. "Our opposition to any attack on Iraq does not imply that we are content with the Iraqi Regime," he said, adding "A military strike, besides inflicting massive damage to the noble Iraqi people, will lead to tension and insecurity in the region". This year's Bahman 22 (February 11) rallies were of special significance considering the U.S. military buildup in the region under the pretext of disarming Iraq. Dozens of parachutists from the Islamic Republic Air Force's airborne division landed on Azadi Square. Helicopters showered flowers on congregation of masses at the square. Tehrani ralliers said the Islamic Revolution of Iran is the harbinger of peace and friendship and condemned Washington's policies to wage a new war in the region. A 10-point resolution, issued at the end of rallies, also voiced readiness of the Iranian nation, government and armed forces to face the U.S. mischief and threats. The resolution condemned the U.S. "foolish" proposals as well as military buildup in the Persian Gulf by non-Muslim governments. The resolution took the move as a threat to the national security of the Persian Gulf littoral sates. It stressed, "The Persian Gulf belongs to Islam and Muslim nations." The resolution also announced support for the oppressed Palestinian nation in the face of aggressions by the Qods occupying regime, saying the threats stem from the U.S. support. It also condemned the probable war on the oppressed Iraqi people, saying any change in the destiny of Iraq should be made by Iraqi citizens themselves.
