TEHRAN - Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Thursday that “deep political bonds” are required as enemies are seeking a collapse of the Islamic Republic system.
 Noting that enemies have targeted unity in Iran, the parliament speaker said, “All should stand against enemy through resistance and (following) guidelines of the Leader who has foiled enemies’ plots.”  He went on to say that Iran has proven its power in the Middle East region and has never bowed to force. Elsewhere, Larijani said that the U.S. has adopted “advantageous” stance on the issue of Iran’s nuclear program. On May 8, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the UN-endorsed nuclear agreement and vowed to reimpose sanctions on Iran. Also in a speech at the Heritage Foundation on May 21 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington will apply economic and military pressure against Iran and will impose “the strongest sanctions in history” on the Islamic Republic. After the U.S. withdrawal, Iran wants assurances from the remaining parties, especially Europeans, that its interests are guaranteed or it will resume nuclear activities with a higher speed.
