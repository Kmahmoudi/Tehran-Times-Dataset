TEHRAN- Croatia has new plans on agenda for development of its economic ties with Iran, Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Martina Dalic announced in a meeting with Mohammad Baqer Nobakht, the head of Management and Planning Organization of Iran, in Tehran on Sunday, IRIB news reported. Referring to the recent visits paid by Iranian senior officials to Croatia, Dalic, who is also the Minister of Economy, Small and Medium Entrepreneurship and Crafts of Croatia, hoped that the existing impediments, including banking and financial ones, on the way to boost mutual economic ties with Iran would be removed in near future. “Croatia is fond of enhancing ties in sectors such as energy, foodstuff, medicine, construction and engineering affairs with Iran,” she said, “We seeks to make Croatian banks active for conducting banking transactions with their Iranian counterparts.” As reported, Iran-Croatia business forum will be held at the place of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) on Monday in the presence of both countries’ top officials and entrepreneurs.
