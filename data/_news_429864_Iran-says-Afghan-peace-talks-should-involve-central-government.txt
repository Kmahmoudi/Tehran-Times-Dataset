TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Saturday discussing the situation in Afghanistan.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran has always supported peace talks in Afghanistan and will use all of its capacities to help the Afghan government in this respect,” Zarif said. The meeting took place on the sidelines of the 32th international conference of Islamic unity. Karzai said during his speech at the conference that Iran’s experience shows that the path of progress can be taken through independence. Zarif also held a separate meeting with Mohammad Mohaqiq, the second deputy chief executive of the National Unity Government.   By pointing to peace initiatives in Afghanistan, Zarif said any peace plan should include the Afghan government. Zarif and Mohaqiq also discussed expansion of relations. The comments by Zarif came after high-ranking members of the Taliban recently held three days of talks in Qatar with the U.S. peace envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad.
