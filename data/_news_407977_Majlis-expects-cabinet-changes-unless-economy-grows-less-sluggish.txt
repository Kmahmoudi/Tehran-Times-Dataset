TEHRAN – A key reformist lawmaker has said the Majlis (parliament) expect changes in the economic team of the Rouhani administration if the current economic sluggishness continues. “It would be much better if the government’s current economic team can invigorate economy, otherwise the Majlis expects some changes (in the team),” said Mohammad Reza Aref on Wednesday. 
President Rouhani has managed to rein in inflation, diminishing to less than 10 percent from a high of more than 40 percent recorded under the Ahmadinejad administration. 
However, the inflation success has not been cost free, causing a stagnation, a point referred by Aref, who leads the parliamentary Hope bloc. 
“More economic dynamism is needed because we are grappling with economic downturn and unemployment.” 
One key area to focus on for employment is tourism, the legislator suggested. “I think the sector can generate a lot of job opportunities.” 
With the current parliament it would be more practical to address such challenges as it is rational.
 
“Unlike the 9th Majlis (previous parliament), the 10th one (current Majlis) has achieved rationality,” said Aref. 
Aref’s comments come just one day after Rouhani’s three ministerial picks won confidence votes from the parliament. AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
