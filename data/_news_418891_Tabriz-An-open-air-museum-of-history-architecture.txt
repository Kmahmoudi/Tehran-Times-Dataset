Kandovan is highly reminiscent of Cappadocia, a historical counterpart in Central Anatolia, Turkey. Masjed-e Kaboud (literary ‘the Blue Mosque’) has long been distinguished for the grandeur of its intricate blue tilework and calligraphy for which it is nicknamed. The ornament took artists about a quarter century to cover every surface.
