TEHRAN- “Iran is fully ready for a daily swap of around 300,000 barrels of oil at Neka terminal,” Mahmoud Astaneh, a board member of Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO), announced. As he told ILNA on Friday, all the required domestic preparations are made due to the order of Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and necessary negotiations with foreign counterparts are underway to restart oil swap at northern port city of Neka. “Caspian littoral states deliver oil to Iran in Neka terminal and will receive it at Iranian southern ports in the Persian Gulf,” he said.
