The relationship between the three countries was first proposed by former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov during a visit to Delhi in 1998. This is the second such talks between the ministers to focus on a number of international issues. The foreign ministers of the three countries last met in Vladivostok in Russia in 2005. "As Russia's relations .. with China grew deeper, India-China relations .. normalized [and] Beijing and New Delhi manifested mounting interest in contacts with Russia in tripartite format on a wide range of matters of mutual interest..," Russian foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin was quoted saying by the Itar-Tass news agency ahead of the meeting.

"What you see unfolding before you is a very mature dialogue that is taking place between two equal partners," she said. Mr Li arrived ahead of Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov for Wednesday's talks involving the three nations. The Chinese delegation made a statement on the test during the talks, Ms Rao said. "They stressed that China was against the weaponization and militarization of outer space and that the test conducted, according to them, was of a purely technological and scientific nature," she said. The test drew sharp responses from Canberra, Washington, Tokyo and Delhi, with several Indian officials and leaders warning against the militarization of outer space. ------------------------ Border row Mr Li and his Indian host, Pranab Mukherjee, also discussed the border dispute that led to the 1962 conflict between the two countries, Indian officials said.

"They reiterated the decision taken by the leaders of the two countries that the special representatives should further intensify their efforts." Last month, special representatives of both countries -- appointed in 2003 -- held another round of talks in Delhi to resolve the border dispute.
