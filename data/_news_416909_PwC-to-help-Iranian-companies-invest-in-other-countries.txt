TEHRAN- PricewaterhouseCoopers’ (PwC) Auditor and Tax Consultant Jens Rönnberg, in a meeting at Tehran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (TCCIMA) on Monday, announced that the multinational professional services network is ready to support Iranian companies to invest in different countries, TCCIMA Public Relations Department announced. During the meeting, held between PwC’s representatives and Iranian entrepreneurs and officials from banking, stock exchange, and international commerce sectors, Rönnberg said that considering the fact that Iran is a large country with a significant market, the major point under the current circumstances is making foreign investors feel confident about entering Iranian market, while it is vital for Iranian firms to boost financial transparency.  “In case of receiving the required permit, PwC will open an office in Tehran within three to six months to collaborate with Iranian companies on providing services,” the PwC official announced. As TCCIMA quoted its head Masoud Khansari addressing the same meeting, as of the implementation of nuclear deal with the six world powers in January 2016, 200 foreign trade delegations have visited Iran to investigate investing here. “Iran is a safe country with young and educated workforce and can be a good destination for foreign investors,” he said.  HJ/MA
