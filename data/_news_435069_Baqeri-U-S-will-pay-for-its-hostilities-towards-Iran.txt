TEHRAN – Major General Mohammad Baqeri, chief of the Iranian armed forces, said on Wednesday that the United States will soon pay the price for its hostilities towards Iran. Baqeri made the remarks while introducing the newly appointed commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Hossein Salami. U.S. move to end sanctions exemptions for Iranian oil exports and its designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization shows the White House’s anger at Iran’s power, Baqeri said, Mehr reported. “Criminals who support terrorists by arming and financing them have named the Guards as a terrorist organization,” the top general lamented.
