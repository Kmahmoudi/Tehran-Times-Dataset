TEHRAN â€“ A total of 29 historical cameras, mainly (mostly) dating from the 19th-century, will go on display at the UNESCO-registered Golestan Palace in downtown Tehran. The three-day exhibition will put on show cameras that were used to capture photos from Qajar-era kings and courtiers within the palace, director of the World Heritage site Masoud Nosrati said, CHTN reported. The exhibit will be held in winter, he said, without mentioning a specific date. Golestan Palace became a center of Qajari arts and architecture which is an outstanding example and has remained a source of inspiration for Iranian artists and architects to this day. It embodies a successful integration of earlier Persian crafts and architecture with Western influences.
