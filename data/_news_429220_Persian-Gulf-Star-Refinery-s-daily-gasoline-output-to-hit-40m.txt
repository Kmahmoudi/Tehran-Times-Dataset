TEHRAN- Daily production of Euro-5 quality gasoline in Iran’s Persian Gulf Star Refinery will reach 40 million liters by the next month, according to the managing director of the refinery. Mohammad-Ali Dadvar put the current output of the refinery at 30 million liters per day, Mehr news agency reported on Saturday. The managing director of refinery further said that the capacity will reach 44 million liters per day by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019) once the third phase of the refinery comes on stream. In mid-December last year, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said: “Iran will reach a stable status in gasoline production once the second phase of Persian Gulf Star Refinery comes on stream.” The second phase of the refinery was inaugurated by President Hassan Rouhani in late June, and on July 28, Dadvar announced that its daily gasoline production has increased 2 million liters to stand at 26 million liters. The refinery in the southern province of Hormozgan is the first of its kind designed based on gas condensate feedstock.
