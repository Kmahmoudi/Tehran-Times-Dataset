TEHRAN - A Qatari news website reported on Friday that Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Oman are to form a joint naval force under China's support in line with increasing maritime security in the Persian Gulf. Al-JadidÂ said China had already begun mediating negotiations among Tehran, Riyadh, and Abu Dhabi aimed at reinforcing navigation's safety in the strategic body of water. Back in March, China successfully helped broker a deal between Tehran and Riyadh according to which Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties after seven years of estrangement. According to analysts, the consent of the Persian Gulf states to Beijing's mediation in such sensitive matters shows China's growing influence in the region as opposed to Washington's declining influence. Iran has long been saying that only regional countries can guarantee the security of the Persian Gulf. Iran, Saudi Arabia to form naval coalition in northern Indian Ocean Iranian Navy Commander Shahram Irani also announced on Saturday that a naval coalition will be formed in the northern Indian Ocean with the involvement of Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Iraq, Pakistan, India, and other countries in the region. Meanwhile, the UAE has announced quitting a U.S.-led naval force. On Wednesday, the website of the Emirati foreign ministry said Abu Dhabi had withdrawn from the Joint Maritime Forces that operate in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The ministry said the Emirates had decided to ditch the naval coalition following an extensive evaluation of its security needs. Analysts say Abu Dhabi has made the decision in line with its ambition to diversify its security relationships.
