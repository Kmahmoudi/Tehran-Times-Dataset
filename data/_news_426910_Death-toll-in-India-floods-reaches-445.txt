TEHRAN - The death toll from floods and landslides in the southern Indian state of Kerala has risen to 445, according to reports in local media. It has been described as the worst floods in a century to hit this flood-prone state of India. Around a million people are still packed into temporary relief camps and 15 are reported missing even as the government mounts an operation to clean homes and public places that have been filled with dirt and sand left by the floods. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a tweet said that more than 130,000 flood-hit houses had been cleaned, or nearly a third of those affected. Authorities are also in the process of restoring electricity connections. People returning to their homes have been told to stay alert as receding waters leave behind a glut of snakes. State authorities and wildlife experts have formed teams to come to the aid of those who have found snakes in their home, according to local media. With death toll rising daily, Kerala authorities said "due process will be followed to ascertain if all these deaths are flood related". Indian government has drawn flak for refusing foreign aid after many countries and global aid agencies had come forward with help for Kerala flood victims. Many Indian aid agencies are currently stationed in Kerala providing relief to the survivors who are putting up in makeshift tents.
