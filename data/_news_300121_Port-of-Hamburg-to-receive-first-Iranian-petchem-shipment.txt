TEHRAN – After seven years, the first consignment of Iranian petrochemical products to Europe will arrive in the Port of Hamburg within the next few days, said the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) Managing director Mohammad Saeidi.  Following 2520 days of travel, Saeidi said, the ship would first dock at the Port of Hamburg and then it would set sail for the port of Antwerp in Belgium, the Tasnim news agency reported on Wednesday. After the removal of U.S. and UN sanctions against Iran on January 16, shipping cargo to European ports is back on track. Referring to the establishment of joint shipping companies in Germany and Italy to cover the northern and southern ports of Europe, the official said, “We are also planning to launch shipping lines to the ports in Latin America.”  According to Saeidi, Iran is planning to launch shipping lines to the ports in Latin America, Central America and North Africa in the coming months, adding that the country would also resume overseas trade with Canada in near future. The official noted that the IRISL fleet is aiming to rise to the place of 15th largest shipping line in the next two years with a broad objective to get among the top ten in the course of five years. The fleet currently ranks 21, he added. In the course of development, Saeidi said, Iran is negotiating with a number of European, Chinese and South Korean as well as domestic companies for building ships. Iran has recently established joint shipping companies in Germany and Italy to cover the northern and southern ports of Europe. Earlier this week, Saeidi put the number of IRISL fleet at 160 vessels with a total capacity of five million tons. Sanctions barred IRISL fleet from sailing in the international waters. They also prohibited international shipping companies from calling on Iranian ports.       SJ/MA/ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
