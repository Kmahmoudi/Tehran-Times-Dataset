TEHRAN – The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said on Tuesday that the Western coalition against terrorism is not “real” and does not seek to eradicate it.
 “Independent countries should quench the fire of division and conflict by strengthening relations and not being influenced by the policies of arrogant powers,” Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said during a meeting with the visiting Bakir Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  “The birthplace of [Takfir and terrorism] seems on the outside to be the Arab region, but in fact the U.S. government and some European governments are the root cause,” the Leader remarked.  “Although it may happen that these coalitions enter into war with terrorists in some cases, they do not seek to genuinely uproot terrorism neither in Iraq nor in Syria,” Ayatollah Khamenei noted. “Their bad and wicked polices are aggravating humanity’s afflictions every passing day.”  The Leader added, “Humiliating Muslim youths in some wealthy and powerful European countries has paved the way for them to join deviant terrorist groups such as Daesh, and upon returning to Europe, these humiliated youths turn to bombing and killing.”   ‘Security essential for progress’  The Leader also underlined that “peace” and “security” are essential for a country to make progress, noting the Iranian government is ready to expand relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina in various areas.  Izetbegovic, for his part, expressed hope that the two countries succeed in expanding ties according to mutual interests.  He stressed it is Bosnia and Herzegovina’s policy to boost relations with the Islamic countries.   ‘Terrorism is a dangerous disease’  Izetbegovic also highlighted the importance of countering terrorism and called terrorism a “dangerous disease”.  He expressed regret over sectarian clashes in the Islamic countries and said boosting “Islamic unity” is all the Muslims’ duty.  Expressing pity over sectarian conflicts, he urged Islamic unity as a must.  AK/NA/SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
