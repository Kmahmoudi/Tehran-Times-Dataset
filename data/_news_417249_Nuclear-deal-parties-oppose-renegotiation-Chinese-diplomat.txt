TEHRAN – The Chinese Ambassador to Tehran, Pang Sen, said in an interview with ISNA published on Monday that all sides to the 2015 nuclear agreement, including China, oppose a renegotiation of the agreement. He emphasized that although the Trump administration is wavering on the issue, the other parties to the agreement underline the need to keep the multilateral deal.  “The nuclear deal proved that through negotiation, we can solve the problem peacefully,” the Chinese diplomat said.
