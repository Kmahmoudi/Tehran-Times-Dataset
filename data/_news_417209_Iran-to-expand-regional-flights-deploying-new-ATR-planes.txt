TEHRAN- The CEO of Iran’s national flag-carrier Iran Air said Iran will utilize the newly received ATR passenger jets purchased from the European plane maker ATR to expand regional flights, IRIB news reported. Farzaneh Sharafbafi made the remarks answering questions of the reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony held for receiving two ATR planes at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday. According to the official, the new routes for the ATRs are being planned and the airplanes will start flying to the neighboring countries soon. “With these two planes, the number of ATR aircrafts in the country’s national airline fleet has reached six,” she said. Iran Air took delivery of the first four of the purchased ATR passenger jets on May 17. The 72-600 turboprop aircrafts landed in Mehrabad Airport.  The Iranian flag carrier finalized a deal on the purchase of 20 ATR 72-600 from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer in mid-February. The 70-seat airplane is used for short-distance flights. Iran has ordered more than 200 planes since international sanctions against the Islamic Republic were lifted last year in return for curbs on the country’s nuclear program. Iran Air has ordered 100 planes from Airbus, 80 from Boeing and 20 ATR turboprops but implementing the deals has been hampered by uncertainty over financing, Reuters reported. EF/MA
