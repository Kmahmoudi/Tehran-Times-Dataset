TEHRAN – Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization is designing a range of promotional cheap package tours, which will be offered to Azerbaijan, Iraq and Turkey nationals in the span of March 16 to April 4. The excursions will cover expenses of air flight tickets, airport transfers and hotel accommodations and also include free-of-charge medical checkups for Iraqi travelers, ISNA reported on Friday. The low-cost packages are to be designed between $350 to $440 for seven- to-eight-day tours to Tehran, Karaj, Hamedan or Tabriz. The tours will be conducted concurrent with Noruz, the Iranian New Year holidays, when major Iranian cities including Tehran are generally felt less populated. Empty-leg flights and hotel vacancies will be taken into account for the project to get off the ground in collaboration with Iran Civil Aviation Organization and several hotels and tour operators. “I consider this scheme as a useful and effective tool for prosperity of the country’s tourism industry, believing it to be welcomed by tourism agencies if implemented properly, particularly in the service sector,” ISNA quoted Manila Mohajer, a member of Iranian Tour Operators Association, as saying. The low-cost packages are to be designed between $350 to $440 for seven- to-eight-day tours to Tehran, Karaj, Hamedan or Tabriz. Over the past year Iran has seen a slow decline in the number of its inbound arrivals in particular from Middle East and Arab states, the report said. Experts say despite having vast tourism potentials, Iran’s international tourism market has partly hampered by its neighbors which are offering    rather less expensive tours and travels.  Embracing 22 World Heritage sites, Iran is a hot travel destination in terms of its rich history, picturesque sceneries, traditions, cuisine and hospitable people. The country’s ultimate goal is to attract 20 million foreign tourists annually by 2025. However, with only eight years to go, according to some experts, the target seems to be somewhat unachievable.
