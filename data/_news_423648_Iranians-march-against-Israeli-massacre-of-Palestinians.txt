TEHRAN - Iranians held rallies outside the former U.S. embassy in Tehran (known as Den of Spies) on Wednesday to condemn the massacre of Palestinians at the hands of Israeli forces.
 60 Palestinians, including children, were shot as they were protesting relocation of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds (Jerusalem) on Monday.  The Iranian marchers were carrying Palestinian flags and pictures of the martyred children.  An 8-month-old child was among the martyred.
