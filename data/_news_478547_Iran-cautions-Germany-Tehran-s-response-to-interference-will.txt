TEHRAN- Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian criticizes his German counterpart's comments endorsing violent riots in Iran as a clear example of interference in the Islamic Republic’s internal affairs and issues a warning that Tehran will respond to such interventionist views with a "proportionate and firm" response. In a tweet on Thursday directed at German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Amir Abdollahian said that “provocative, interventionist and undiplomatic stances don’t signal sophistication and wisdom.” Noting that “Germany can choose engagement to address shared challenges-or confrontation,” Amir Abdollahian said “undermining old ties has long-term consequences”. The top Iranian diplomat added, “Our response will be proportionate and firm.” On Wednesday, Baerbock again expressed support for the riots in Iran and declared that the European Union will seek to enact further sanctions against Tehran the following week. After Mahsa Amini's death, riots erupted throughout Iran in the middle of September. The 22-year-old lost consciousness inside a Tehran police station and was declared dead three days later in hospital. Western nations, particularly the United States, offered support as rioters rampaged around the country, violently assaulting security forces. According to an official assessment by Iran's forensic authorities, Amini's death was brought on by disease as opposed to reported blows to the skull or other important body parts. The European Union imposed sanctions on Iran in response to the country's handling of the unrest. Iran, in reply, declared tit-for-tat penalties against European Union institutions and individuals for their purposeful acts in supporting violent acts.
