TEHRAN - IRGC chief Major General Hossein Salami on Monday praised the Army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as powerful representatives of the Islamic Republic and asserted that both organizations collaborate to counter threats and defeat adversarial plans. The remarks by the IRGC chief came as Iran is set to hold National Army Day on Tuesday, April 18. The general declared that the military forces would continue to frustrate Iran’s sworn enemies while praising the IRGC and Army as the strong arms of the Iranian nation that are at the forefront of defending national, revolutionary, and religious ideals. The Iranian Armed Forces and security and intelligence organizations have teamed up and are acting vigilantly, shrewdly, and collectively to upset the enemy’s calculations and challenge the anti-Iran strategies and policies of the hegemonic system and Zionism, according to General Salami, who warned of the never-ending threats by Iran’s enemies. The head of the IRGC further pointed out that the Army has been pursuing a “permanent strengthening” plan over the past 44 years. The Army, he said, has not stopped advances in defense industry or failed to recognize, even for a second, the dangers posed by the adversaries. The commander stressed the importance of ongoing efforts to strengthen military might and promised that the Armed Forces would never disregard the enemy’s threats and plans. The parades on Tuesday, renowned as annual showcase for the most recent equipment and accomplishments of the Iranian Army, will feature a variety of Army units showcasing their most recent achievements. In a meeting with a group of top military commanders on Sunday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution urged the Armed Forces to keep improving their readiness in all areas and keep making progress because the threats by the enemies will never go away.
