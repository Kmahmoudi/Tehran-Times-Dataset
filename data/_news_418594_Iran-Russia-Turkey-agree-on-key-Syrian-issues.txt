TEHRAN – Iran, Russia and Turkey, the three power brokers in Syria, on Sunday succeeded to reach an agreement on “all the key issues” to bring an end to the nearly seven years of war in Syria. The agreement was made as Javad Zarif, Sergei Lavrov and Mevlut Cavusoglu - respectively the foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey - met in Antalya in continuation of diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. During a press briefing on the outcome of the trilateral meeting, Zarif said Iran, Russia and Turkey are ready to establish means for lasting security, stability and peace in Syria, IRNA reported. He noted, “The measures taken in Astana, over the past eleven months have dramatically minimized conflicts in Syria.” Zarif praised the role of regional cooperation in easing the Syrian crisis, saying because of such cooperation the war fatalities in Syria fell considerably and the resistance forces have gained momentum in their success against the terrorist groups. Iranian, Russian, Turkish presidents to meet on Syria soon  Presidents of Iran, Russia and Turkey will attend a summit in Sochi, Russia, on Wednesday to accelerate the peace process and find ways to guarantee a better future for Syria, Zarif said. “We hope to prepare a suitable ground for overcoming bitter conditions of the Syrian people. Those are the Syrian people who prepare the ground for stability, peace and security of their country along with the Syrian government,” Zarif explained. A few hours after the trilateral meeting, Zarif tweeted about the success of the peace initiative and denounced Saudi Arabia for fueling terrorism in the region. “Working with Turkish & Russian counterparts to build on ceasefire we achieved in Syria & preparing for inclusive dialog among Syrians,” he said. “Irony is KSA accuses Iran of destabilization, while itself fuels terrorists, wages war on Yemen, blockades Qatar & foments crisis in Lebanon.” Agreement on all key issues  Lavrov told reporters that the foreign ministers of the three countries reached agreement on all the key issues. “We have gathered to discuss certain issues related to preparations for the summit of the three countries’ president, which is due in Sochi on November 22,” Lavrov said, TASS news agency reported. “The work was very useful, we have reached agreement on all the key issues.” “We shall report to our presidents our views on how to move forward, how to improve the process, which we call the Astana process and which should offer most favorable conditions to have the Geneva process at last gain some effective instruments to settle the tasks, outlined in the UN Security Council’s Resolution 2254,” the Russian minister said. Iran, Turkey and Russia brokered the Astana peace initiative and agreed to act as guarantors of a nationwide Syrian ceasefire. So far, the three countries have held seven rounds of peace talks in Astana in order to find a solution to end the Syrian crisis. The fourth round of the Astana talks in May produced a document on creating de-escalation zones in Syria. According to the document, the de-escalation zones include Idlib province and part of the provinces of Latakia, Hama and Aleppo, the area to the north of Homs, Eastern Ghouta, as well as Deraa and Quneitra provinces in southern Syria. The de-escalation zones are closed to the U.S.-led coalition’s aviation. The coalition’s aviation can operate only in areas controlled by Daesh (ISIS). MH/PA
