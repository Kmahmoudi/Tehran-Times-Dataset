TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that the Iranian people continue supporting the Islamic Republic system despite pressure by foreigners. Rouhani made the remarks while visiting - along with his cabinet members - the shrine of Imam Khomeini and the tombs of the martyrs of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Rouhani said, “Those who think they can decide for Iran’s future by resorting to the United Nations Security Council should realize that the Iranian nation will never give up Imam Khomeini’s legacy: Islamism and Republicanism.” “Return is impossible,” he stressed. The remarks came just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington stands with the people of Iran against the country’s ruling establishment. During his State of the Union address, Trump called the Islamic Republic a “corrupt dictatorship” and said “America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.” “As long as people love the culture of Islam and love their Iran and safeguard their national unity, no superpower can change the path of this nation,” Rouhani responded. He also hinted that the country’s authorities should listen to what people want and draw on the lessons of the past, especially the Shah’s fall. “All officials of the country should have a listening ear for people’s demands and wishes,” he said. “The previous regime thought it would rule forever, but lost everything because it didn’t listen to people’s criticism and advice,” the president warned. “It only heard the voice of people’s Revolution.” Rouhani and his entourage also visited the tombs of the martyrs of the eight-year Holy Defense against the invading Saddam army and the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  The day Imam Khomeini returned to Iran from exile (Feb 1, 1979) marks the beginning of the Ten-Day Dawn in ceremonies which culminate with the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution on February 11, 1979.  Iranians toppled the U.S.-backed Pahlavi regime 39 years ago, ending 2,500 years of monarchy in the country.
