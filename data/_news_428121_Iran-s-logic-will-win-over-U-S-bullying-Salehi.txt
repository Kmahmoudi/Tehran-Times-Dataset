TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), said on Tuesday that Iran has the upper hand in regional developments.
 “Fortunately, we have shown so far that we advance our policies by vigilance and wisdom and we have the upper hand in the regional equations,” he said during a ceremony. He added, “Rouhani’s trip to New York proved that Iran negotiates and makes agreements, but the U.S. has violated all its obligations.” He said that at the 73the UN General Assembly Iran was at the center of attention and the U.S. was isolated. “At the end, Iran’s power of logic will overcome the U.S. bullying,” he noted. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the 2015 nuclear deal in May. During his speech at the 73th UN General Assembly summit, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the U.S. withdrawal “unilateral” and “illegal”. “We concur that, at the end of the day, there is no better way but dialogue. However, dialogue is two-way: it should be based on equality, justice, and human integrity and honor, and conducted in accordance with the rules and norms of international law,” Rouhani stated.
