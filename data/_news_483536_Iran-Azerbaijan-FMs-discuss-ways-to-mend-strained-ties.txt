TEHRAN- Amidst rising tensions between the two neighbors, the foreign ministers of Iran and Azerbaijan have held conversations about how to overcome current misconceptions and issues pertaining to bilateral ties. On Friday night and Saturday afternoon, Hossein Amir Abdollahian of Iran and Jeyhun Bayramov of Azerbaijan had two rounds of in-depth discussions concerning the evolution of Tehran-Baku ties as well as other regional concerns. Respect for good neighborliness, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity was also emphasized. Amir Abdollahian cautioned of the Israeli regime’s machinations against the region’s unity, security, and growth, saying, “Only enemies benefit from the existence of differences among regional countries.” The senior diplomats from Iran and Azerbaijan additionally stressed the necessity of focusing media campaigns on shared goals. After an attack on the Eurasian nation’s embassy in Tehran in January, Azerbaijan’s ties with Iran became tense. President Ilham Aliyev blamed the incident on the “Iranian establishment” as Azerbaijan shuttered its diplomatic office and withdrew employees following what it dubbed a “terrorist act.” Azerbaijan on Thursday declared four employees of the Iranian embassy in Baku “persona non grata” and asked them to leave the country. Azerbaijan claimed they were engaged in “provocative actions” that contributed to the most recent worsening of relations between the two nations. The action was taken shortly after Baku claimed it had detained six men who were allegedly connected to the Iranian secret services and orchestrating a coup in the Caspian country.
