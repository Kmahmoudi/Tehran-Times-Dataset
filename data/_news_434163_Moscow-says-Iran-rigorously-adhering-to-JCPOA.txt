TEHRAN – Tehran is rigorously complying with the nuclear deal it signed with world powers in July 2015, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday. Speaking during a press briefing in Moscow, Zakharova said, “Iran strictly complies with all relevant requirements (under the JCPOA) and this is regularly confirmed by the IAEA.” “Nuclear activities in this country are under the constant control of the agency and are an example of transparency,” she added, Tasnim reported. The spokeswoman also stated that the U.S. actions, which aimed to prevent the implementation of the JCPOA, were a source of concern for all parties to the deal.
