Macron noted that preserving the nuclear deal will lead to trust-building and help the regional security and stability. “Clear position of France and the Europeans is remaining within the framework of the JCPOA and we want you to remain in the agreement,” he said. He noted, “The EU and France accept the JCPOA as the way it is.” Macron also said that France wants a stable Middle East and believes that the JCPOA is an important model to solve problems in the region. All sides should remain committed to the deal, he advised. The French president has said there is no “plan B” for the nuclear accord.
