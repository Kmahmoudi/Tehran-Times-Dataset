Flocks of migratory geese are shown at a wetland habitat situated in Iran’s northern Mazandaran province, February 16, 2018. Captured by Gholamreza Rezaei and resealed by IRNA, the picture belongs to a photo collection that depicts various wildlife refuges dotted along the south Caspian Sea region.   The wetlands will remain dominated by its northerly guests until about mid-May when the migration season comes to an end. They host hundreds of birdwatchers, backpackers, and bird buffs as well. The mid-winter population of the migratory birds is estimated to exceed over a million in the whole sandy shorelines that add up to 700km.
