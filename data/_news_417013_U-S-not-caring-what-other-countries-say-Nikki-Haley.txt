TEHRAN – U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Thursday dismissed other countries’ opinion about whether the U.S. should stay in the nuclear deal or not, saying, “It has never moved the U.S. to care about what other countries say.” “Those countries don’t have Iranians saying ‘death to America,’” said Haley during a press briefing on Thursday. “They're not saying ‘death to Germany’. They're not saying all of those things.”  She also said Iran is working with other countries that may also want the same thing.
