TEHRAN- Another indication that authorities in the Scandinavian country of Sweden are looking to intensify their anti-Iran policies is the recent decision by a Swedish court to condemn a former Iranian judicial official to life in prison over his claimed participation in the killings of MEK terrorist members in Iran in the 1980s.  The trial, over which the Swedish court has no jurisdiction, has really been set up to undermine the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Here are 12 justifications: The Hamid Nouri prosecution is evidence that Sweden has opted to intensify its hostility toward Iran, which is consistent with other instances of Sweden's hostility toward Iran. Over the years, Sweden has housed a variety of organizations and people that have engaged in terrorism in Iran or advocated the breakup of the nation. By taking Muslim children from their families or standing silent about barbaric crimes like burning the holy Quran in the country, Sweden has stepped up its anti-immigration and anti-Muslim policies. The prosecution of a former Iranian official by a Swedish court over the 1980s killings of MEK members in Iran is not a matter of international concern over which the court might exercise its jurisdiction. In reality, the MEK began a terrorist campaign against Iran in 1988, long after the Iran-Iraq war had ended. By ignoring Hamid Nouri's expert witnesses and failing to open inquiries into the alleged crimes' sites, the court has broken several fundamental tenets of international law. All of the witnesses who testified in court were MEK members, who are regarded as terrorists in Iran. For two weeks, the court even scheduled sessions inside a MEK-run camp in Albania so that more MEK members might testify against Nouri. Nouri has committed no crimes in the country, hence the court's decision to look into the issue based on human rights concerns is groundless. The process demonstrates unequivocally that American pressure and influence have been exerted on Swedish judicial officials. In reality, the court abused its authority by looking into a global crime. Following their release from jail and after making amends, a large number of MEK members left Iran. However, a large number of people perished in the group's military assault on Iran in July 1988.  The court's argument that killings of MEK members in Iranian jails in 1988 were unconstitutional has no foundation because the executions included terrorists and occurred after the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. The Swedish court's refusal to accept a single witness' testimony in support of the Islamic Republic of Iran raises more doubts about its credibility in the case. This comes as virtually every declaration made by MEK sympathizers and its members throughout the trial has been accepted.
