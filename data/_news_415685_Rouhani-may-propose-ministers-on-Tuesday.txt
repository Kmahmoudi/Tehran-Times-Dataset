TEHRAN – A member of the Majlis presiding board has said President Hassan Rouhani will likely propose his cabinet minister to the parliament on Tuesday.

 Speaking to Tasnim on Saturday, Ahmad Amir-Abadi also said proposing ministers on the president’s inauguration day is inadvisable since it would overshadow the swearing-in ceremony which is supposed to be a show of strength. Rouhani was sworn into his second presidential term on Saturday afternoon in Majlis before tens of high-ranking foreign delegations. SP/PA
