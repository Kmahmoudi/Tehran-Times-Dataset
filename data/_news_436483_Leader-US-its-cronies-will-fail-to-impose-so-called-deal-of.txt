TEHRAN- Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says the US and its cronies will fail to impose the so-called deal of the century on Palestinians. The Leader made the remarks in a meeting with a number of university professors, elites and researchers in Tehran on Wednesday. Ayatollah Khamenei said that defending Palestinians was both a humanitarian and a religious duty and noted that participation in this yearâ€™s International Quds Day rallies was more important than before given the ongoing sensitive developments in the region.
