TEHRAN- In a Saturday meeting with members of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA), President Hassan Rouhani’s nominated minister of transport and urban development Mohammad Eslami discussed some of his major plans, IRNA reported. Among his main priorities, Eslami referred to privatization and downsizing the government. “We need a reformation in structure of Transport Ministry to make the government swift,” Eslami said. He also underscored the significant role of the private sector in financing and implementing development projects, specifically under the present conditions of the country. In a meeting with ICCIMA members, Rouhani’s nominated Minister of Economy and Finance Farhad Dejpasand elaborated his future plans for the ministry on October 20, where he underlined that on the way to reach stable economic conditions, government’s interference in the economic affairs should be minimized and it should become smaller and swift.   Iran's parliament held a vote of confidence session on Saturday evening. Rouhani attended the session to defend the plans and competency of his proposed ministers. In a letter to the parliament, last week, Hassan Rouhani proposed new picks for labor, economy, industry and road ministries. Mohammad Shariatmadari was suggested for the Ministry of Cooperatives, Labor, and Social Welfare, which had been run by a caretaker minister since the impeachment of Minister Ali Rabiei on August 8 by the parliament over mismanagement. Reza Rahmani, the deputy minister of industry and trade, was suggested for ministerial role in the same ministry. Votes of confidence for the four nominated ministers were not cast by the time this report was drafted.
