TEHRAN – The Iranian Parliament (Majlis) on Sunday sent the CFT bill, which the Guardian Council says there is still 19 faults with it, to the Expediency Council.
 CFT is a convention to combat financing of terrorism. 117 MPs out of 197 legislators present in the parliament voted for sending the bill to the council. On October 7, 2018, the parliament voted in favor of the CFT. At the time, a total of 143 lawmakers out of 268 ones present in the parliament voted in favor of the bill. However, the oversight Guardian Council rejected the bill by finding 22 faults with it. Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh told reporters on Sunday that 3 of the faults have been corrected. To become a law, the Guardian Council should vet the bill for compliance with the Constitution. According to the constitution, in cases when the parliament and the Guardian Council disagree on a bill the issue is referred to the Expediency Council for final arbitration. ‘Iran has right to set conditions on CFT’ Falahatpisheh also said that the parliament voted that Iran should have the right to set conditions in order to join the CFT. He said that the first condition is that Iran cannot do anything contrary to its constitution in implementing the CFT. The second condition is that the article 6 of the CFT should not prevent Iran from setting conditions.
