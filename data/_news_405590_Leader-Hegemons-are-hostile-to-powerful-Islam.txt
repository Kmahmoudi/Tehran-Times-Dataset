TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that the Islamic Revolution like a “massive earthquake shook the pillars of the hegemonic system”.
 “With the grace of ‘revolutionary Islam’ and ‘Islamic revolution’ the main goal of the bullying global powers, which is governing the region, ended in failure and the United States has been practically grounded in the West Asia region,” Ayatollah Khamenei said during a meeting with prayer leaders of local mosques from different parts of Tehran province. The Leader went on to say that the hegemons are not in animosity with “secular Islam” even if it has large numbers of followers, rather they are hostile to “powerful Islam” which shapes political and social systems. “Islamic revolution shook hegemonic system like strong quake.” Elsewhere in his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei said after the 2009 presidential election, which two losing candidates claimed vote rigging, he advised one of the protest leaders that his behavior will be misused by foreigners but that losing candidate did not “understand” it. “I told one of the leaders of fitna that apparently you support the system and according to yourself are making an election protest but you should know that the management of this trend will fall into the hands of foreigners and they (enemies), by misusing your behavior, target the core of the system.” However, the Supreme Leader said, they “did not understand my words, and you noticed how they (enemies) used the election as a pretext to attack and deny the entire system.” ‘Mosque is core of cultural resistance’ The Leader also said mosque is the “core of resistance” especially, cultural resistance. He called mosque a place for “consultation, resistance, planning and social and cultural interaction”. “In the history of Islam, mosque has been a center for consultating, cooperating and making decisions on important social, political and military issues,” he said. He highlighted the importance of boosting the people’s “religious faith” which is the “main reliance” of the system and revolution. Elsewhere, the Leader said prayer leaders are duty bound to uphold righteousness and justice and introduce the religious law. He also said that the arrogant powers seek to influence the native culture and undermine the people’s faith and belief. The Leader also said, “In spite of comprehensive, obvious, covert and complicated hostilities of the cruel powers, the pure word of the Islamic Republic is being strengthened day by day and all the plots [against the country] will be foiled thanks to the people’s unity and faith.” NA/PA    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
