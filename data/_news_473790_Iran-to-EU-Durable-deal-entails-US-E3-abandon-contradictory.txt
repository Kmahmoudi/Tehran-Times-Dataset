TEHRAN - Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian told EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Saturday that Iran welcomes “logical talks” that would lead to results, but it is “essential” that the United States and the European trio (E3) abandon their “contradictory” approaches. “Tehran has always welcomed result-oriented logical negotiations, but to achieve a good and durable deal it is essential that other sides abandon their paradoxical and contradictory behaviors,” Amir Abdollahian stated in open reference to the adoption of the IAEA Board of Governors’ resolution against Iran. This is the first telephone conversation between Amir Abdollahian and Borrell since the 35-nation board adopted the censure resolution. The resolution, adopted on June 8, was drafted by the U.S. and the European trio of Britain, France and Germany. “After the issuance of the resolution in the Agency’s Board of Governors we showed that we will not back down from the rights of the Iranian nation and if the U.S. wants to continue its unconstructive behavior, it will face with our proper response,” Amir Abdollahian added. However, the Iranian chief diplomat said, Iran “still believes that diplomacy is the best and the most appropriate path and solution” to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. “Iran has never departed from the negotiation table and that is why it has always put forward important initiatives for reaching a favorable deal. But negotiation must produce results,” Amir Abdollahian asserted. For his part, the senior EU official stated that he would continue to play a positive role in assisting the JCPOA parties in reaching a final deal, emphasizing the significance of diplomacy and avoiding unconstructive steps in this respect. Acknowledging that Iran has strong will to strike a good and durable accord to save the JCPOA, Borrell said the two parties are close to reaching an agreement in Vienna. Now is the moment, according to Borrell, to promptly reconvene the Vienna negotiations and make steps to avoid further escalation of tensions. He added that he is willing to go to whatever length to assist Iran and the other sides to revive the JCPOA. Addressing the UN Security Council on Thursday, the EU foreign policy chief also said he is in “permanent contact” with all partis to the Vienna talks to resurrect the JCPOA. “I am in permanent contact with all the parties to try to arrange a return to the JCPOA and ensure its full implementation,” the EU’s chief diplomat pointed out. Borrell added, “The basic elements and terms to do this are known and on the table. And the time for decision is now.” Negotiations started in Vienna in April last year to reinstate the JCPOA, which was terminated by former U.S. President Donald Trump in May of 2018.
