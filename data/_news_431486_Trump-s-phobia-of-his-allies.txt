TEHRAN - Trump's fear of his friends and his cabinet is a topic that has been implicitly, and sometimes directly, pointed out in the Western media. This phobia led Trump to remove many of his cabinet members. Trump assume that his allies are making conspiracies against him, and when they disagree with his announced policies in their behavior and speeches,  It's part of this conspiracy.  This presumption has made him even suspect of those who are too silent in his government! Mike Pence, the Vice President of the United States, is one of these people. The American sources have long acknowledged that Trump is not confident about Mike Pence and his actions, and that sooner or later, he may dismiss him from his post.  A recently published analysis in the New York Times (about Trump's chaotic state) made the U.S. President even more pessimistic about those around him, a subject that has long been a challenge to the White House. Recently, the New York Times referred to the changes made in Trump's government during the past two years as "the calm before the storm", and claimed that in the next two years (2019 and 2020), we will see the raise of crises in the White House, which could affect Trump's political future. In the part of this analysis, we read: "When President Trump grows frustrated with advisers during meetings, which is not an uncommon occurrence, he sits back in his chair, crosses his arms and scowls. Often he erupts. “Freaking idiots!” he calls his aides. Except he uses a more pungent word than “freaking.”"
It continues; "For two years, Mr. Trump has waged war against his own government, convinced that people around him are fools. Angry that they resist his wishes, uninterested in the details of their briefings, he becomes especially agitated when they tell him he does not have the power to do what he wants, which makes him suspicious that they are secretly undermining him." This is while Trump has once said that he alone can fix the problems, and he can run the government on his own. Trump's narcissism can't be easily ignored. In the 2016 elections, he warned Republican leaders of an independent election campaign.  He repeatedly stated that he alone could win the election without the support of the Republican Party. It should be also noted that after the Republicans' defeat in the mid-term elections, he called the Republican officials responsible for this defeat, and denied his role in it.
The fact is that Trump has a phobia of his allies and companions, especially those around him. His fear will be more remarkable over the remaining two years of his presence in power. Trump is not confident about his administration's reactions to issues such as Muller's report, etc.  He believes that his companions may leave him alone, or take opposing positions in the most difficult circumstances. "The swirl of recent days — a government shutdown, spiraling scandals, tumbling stock markets, abrupt troop withdrawals and the resignation of his alienated defense secretary — has left the impression of a presidency at risk of spinning out of control" says the New York Times.  It's not without a reason that the New York Times analyzes recent events in the United States as the calm before the storm. Obviously, in the near future, Trump will openly announce his positions, or better to say suspicions, about some of his cabinet members and even his closest companions.
