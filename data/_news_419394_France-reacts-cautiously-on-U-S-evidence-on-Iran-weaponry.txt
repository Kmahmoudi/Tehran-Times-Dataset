France reacted cautiously on Friday to U.S. evidence which claimed Iran supplied weapons to Yemeni Houthis, saying it was still studying information at its disposal and the UN had yet to draw any conclusions.
 U.S. Ambassador to UN Nikki Haley on Thursday presented the debris of a missile at a military base in Washington in which she claimed it was made by Iran and used on November 4 by Yemen’s Houthi group to target an airport near Riyadh. “The United Nations secretariat has not, at this stage, drawn any conclusions. France continues to examine the information at its disposal,” Reuters quoted Alexandre Giorgini, the French foreign ministry deputy spokesman, as saying. In a tweet on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said, “While Iran has been calling for ceasefire, aid and dialogue in Yemen from day 1, U.S. has sold weapons enabling its allies to kill civilians and impose famine. No amount of alternative facts or alternative evidence covers up U.S. complicity in war crimes.”
