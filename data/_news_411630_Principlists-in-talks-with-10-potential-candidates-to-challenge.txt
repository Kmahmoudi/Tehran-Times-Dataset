TEHRAN – The principlist Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces (PFIRF) is consulting with 10 potential candidates that it elected in its recent gathering to reach a conclusion as to who among these ten persons should run in the May presidential election, the front’s spokeswoman Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi said on Saturday.  Coming into existence in late December, the PFIRF has pledged to become the main rival to incumbent President Hassan Rouhani who is expected to contest the elections for a second term. It intends to unite the principlist camp in order to introduce a single candidate to challenge Rouhani.
