Taherian in a statement called the "terrorist" attack as an act against the interests of the Muslim nation of Afghanistan, IRNA reported. The statement touched on the "effective" role of the traditional elderly council of Afghanistan- Loya Jirga- and the council meetings, saying that in the present juncture when all the Afghan leaders and officials have decided to settle ongoing disputes through dialogue and understanding, the Tuesday's rocket attack can be interpreted as a token of opposition to the will and determination of the Afghan civilians. It stressed that Iran's general policy is based on restoration of security, development and collective efforts in Afghanistan. Two rocket blasts rocked Kabul on Tuesday night. Local sources say that the rockets had landed in a farm in the vicinity of the U.S. Embassy and the headquarters of the UN International Security Resistance Force (ISAF). Afghan security sources announced today that a number of suspects had been arrested in connection with the rocket attack, which they blame on Taleban and Al-Qaeda agents.
