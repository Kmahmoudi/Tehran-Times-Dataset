TEHRAN – No one in Iran is seeking to negotiate with the U.S., the Iranian ambassador to Belarus said on Friday, IRNA reported. The positions adopted by the high-ranking Iranian officials, including the Leader, president, head of the Supreme National Security Council and other branches of power, show that nobody in Iran is seeking negotiation with the U.S., Mostafa Oveisi said. Oveisi said the U.S. violation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, (JCPOA) is against international law, adding Iran will be committed to the nuclear deal as long as its interests are secured.
