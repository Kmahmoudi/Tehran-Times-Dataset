TEHRAN – Parliament National Security and Foreign Policy Committee chief Alaeddin Boroujerdi has said that talks with the European Union over the fate of the nuclear agreement (JCPOA) is an “important historical test” for the 28-nation bloc.
 “They must decide in the coming weeks about the continuation of Barjam (a Persian acronym for the nuclear deal),” Boroujerdi told ISNA on Tuesday. He also said unlike the beginning of the nuclear talks, there’s no unity among other countries against Iran, pointing to U.S. economic war against China, Japan and South Korea as examples of Washington’s fading power in the world.   MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
