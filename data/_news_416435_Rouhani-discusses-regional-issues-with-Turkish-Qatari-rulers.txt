TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani held phone conversations with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday and discussed expansion of relations as well as regional stability and security.
 In his talks with the Qatari emir, Rouhani highlighted the necessity of increasing consultations, boosting cooperation and expanding ties. Rouhani said Iran considers the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar as unfair, noting it will make more “tension among regional states”. Rouhani went on to say that Iran “makes all efforts to cooperate with the Qatari people and government and help regional stability.” On June 5, Saudi Arabia along with the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and closed their air, land and sea routes to the country for its relations with the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. For his part, Sheikh Tamim praised Iran’s efforts to help the blockaded Qatar. He also described prospect of Tehran-Doha cooperation as “bright” and “promising”. Qatar is ready to expand relations with Iran in various spheres, the emir added. Iran and Turkey have been selling foods and other commodities to Qatar since the tiny state came under sanctions by the mentioned countries. ‘Iran determined to expand ties with Turkey’ In his phone talks with Erdogan, Rouhani also said that his new government is determined to expand ties with the friendly and neighboring country of Turkey. Bilateral relations between Iran and Turkey is witnessing “fundamental developments due the two countries officials’ determination and efforts” to strengthen ties and also the “establishment of the supreme council of Iran-Turkey cooperation”.  He also noted that the two countries should expand cooperation in line with helping regional stability and security. “Iran and Turkey, as two major regional powers, should make more efforts in line with helping establish stability and security in the region,” the Iranian president suggested. Rouhani also said that a disintegration of regional countries is not at the interest of the people in the region, an indirect reference to the planned independence referendum in the Iraqi Kurdistan. For his part, Erdogan said that Iran-Turkey ties will definitely expand during the new administration of President Rouhani. Turkey is determined to expand political and economic ties with Iran, Erdogan added. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
