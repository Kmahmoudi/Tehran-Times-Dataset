TEHRAN – Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri, the deputy chief of Iran's armed forces, said on Sunday that independence referendum in the Iraqi Kurdistan will lead to new conflicts in Iraq and the region. Noting that the vote would lead to many disasters, Jazayeri said one of the long-term policies of the U.S. and the Zionist regime is to disintegrate and weaken Muslim countries. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi also commented on the issue, saying the vote is a “strategic mistake”.
