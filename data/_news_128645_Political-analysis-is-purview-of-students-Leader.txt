Pointing to the young students’ vitality, Ayatollah Khamenei said new outlooks toward issues, new thoughts and ideas, idealistic expectations, and critical voices arising from such expectations are the unique characteristics of students. Insisting that such inclinations are the foundation for national development, the Leader stated, “If the young students are not satisfied with the current situation and constantly think of progressive steps and seek the ideals of the revolution, the country will move forward on the correct path of progress. “Politicization is not acceptable at all, but practicing politics and political understanding and analysis are the dire needs of students, and universities and the students unions should make plans along these lines.” The fact that the third and fourth generations of the Islamic Revolution are interested in Islamic ideals and are ready to enter difficult and important arenas shows the progress of the Islamic system in Iran, he noted. “Today, if something like the imposed (Iran-Iraq) war happens, the young generation is ready to create another glorious epic,” he added. Ayatollah Khamenei went on to say that the future of the Islamic Revolution is very bright and promising, adding, “Undoubtedly, the Islamic Republic will acquire a decisive role in global equations. “To this end, we need a persevering, motivated, hard-working, expert, faithful young generation that relies on Islamic principles.” For their part, the students called on officials to cooperate with the most talented students, to avoid trial and error in the decision-making process, and to create a proper atmosphere at universities for the presentation of theories and scientific criticism. They also urged the government to draft long-term strategies for educational and cultural issues at universities, to use the student’s views in managing the universities and resolving their problems, and to devise proper plans for student unions to establish relations with universities throughout the Islamic world. In addition, the students criticized the performance of the three branches of the government in combating economic corruption. Officials should maintain unity, support the volunteer activities of students in underprivileged areas of the country, and redouble their efforts to draw up a comprehensive scientific plan for the country, the students said.
