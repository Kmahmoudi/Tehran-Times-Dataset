TEHRAN - The U.S. has expanded its unconditional support for Riyadh’s bloody war on Yemen by secretly deploying a team of elite commandos to the Yemeni border. The war in Yemen has entered a new phase. In addition to supporting the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and earning money by selling weapons to them, the U.S. is seeking to realize its hidden goals in Yemen. This is due to the strategic and geopolitical importance of Yemen and the Strait of Bab al-Mandab. The United States does not seek peace and is unwilling to stop the war in Yemen because it sees the conflict as an opportunity to maintain its military presence in the region. Masquerading to complying with the human rights, Washington is always keeping mum about the massacre of the Yemeni people, and shows fully support for the Saudis. Ansarullah officials repeatedly said that this is an American-Saudi action since the assault on the Saudi-led coalition began in Yemen, but Washington has falsely claimed it was not much involved in the war. An American media outlet revealed the direct role of U.S. troops alongside Saudi-led forces against Yemenis, so the Pentagon could no longer hide its presence and acknowledged that its troops are directly involved in the aggression on Yemen. The Pentagon spokesperson said its forces are fighting alongside Saudi troops and contributing to the targeting of Houthi rockets. The United States has an active engagement in supporting the borders of Saudi Arabia through attacks on Yemenis and has been giving the Saudis logistical and military aid. The New York Times reported on Thursday that about a dozen commandos with the U.S. Army Special Forces, known as the Green Berets, had been deployed in December 2017 to Saudi Arabia’s southern border regions. Certainly, the actual number of these Green Berets probably exceeds the figure of 12. They arrived in Yemen at the request of Mohammed bin Salman, the current crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who had just visited Washington. Yemeni ballistic missiles are clearly a source of concern for Saudi officials. The involvement of the U.S. in a direct war with Iran and its allies in Yemen after three years of Yemeni war shows that a military solution is still preferred over any political solution. It appears that the Americans intend to fight against Iran and its allies, too. It is unlikely that the direct military intervention of the United States in Yemen will actually reward Saudi Arabia for contributing directly or indirectly in war against Iran in the aftermath of the possible withdrawal of the United States from JCPOA. With regard to the new situation in the Yemeni crisis: - The war of Yemen has entered a new phase by the intervention of American troops directly into the war. - The direct presence of Washington in the war is evidence of the inability of the Saudis to prevail, especially in border battles with the Yemeni people. -The U.S. can’t pretend to support the Yemeni people and take a political path. -The U.S. will receive more graft from Riyadh for this direct partnership. - At the moment, the Saudis have not only failed to achieve their goals in the Yemeni war, but they have appealed to Washington for help to secure their borders. - As the U.S. failed to achieve its goals in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, it is plunging into another quagmire in Yemen.
