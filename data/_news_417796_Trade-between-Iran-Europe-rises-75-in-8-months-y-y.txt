TEHRAN- Trade exchange between Iran and Europe increased 75 percent in the first eight month of 2017 from the same period last year, based on the latest figures released by the European Union’s statistics agency Eurostat. Iran-Europe trade stood at €13.6 billion in the first eight months of this year, while the figure was €7.5 billion in the time span from January to August 2016, the same report confirmed. The upward trend of Europe’s imports of Iranian crude oil, following the implementation of Iran’s nuclear deal with G5+1, has played an important role in pushing the figure up, the report added. Europeans imported €6.5 billion of goods from Iran in the first eight months of 2017, showing 144 percent growth from €2.66 billion in the same period in 2016. Their exports to the Islamic country in the first eight months of 2017, registering 37 percent rise, hit €6.66 billion, while the figure stood at €4.84 billion in the same time in the preceding year.
