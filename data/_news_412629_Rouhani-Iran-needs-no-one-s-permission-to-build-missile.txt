TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that Iran needs no one’s permission to build missile and planes.
 During a ceremony held to unveil the Defense Ministry’s achievements, he said that Iran has never sought to attack any country, however peace is not a “one-way road”. “Iran has never intended any aggression and will not; however, peace is not a one-way road and therefore we should always be vigilant,” the president asserted. He added, “Maintaining regional balance and preemptive power is essential for a country like Iran which has endangered interests of major powers and sent message of justice and freedom to the world.”  Rouhani, a former top security official, also said that major powers have always sought their interests in the Middle East region and have undermined regional security and stability. The president went on to say that strengthening the armed forces is just for defensive objectives. Rouhani also highlighted the importance of resistance. “We should always be ready especially because of the fact that we have been under military, political and economic attacks after the revolution,” he said.
