TEHRAN - In recent days, many articles on the 2010 presidential election in the United States are published. Some analysts believe that Trump will have a difficult path in pursuit of his rival candidate, while others believe he will eventually be elected as President of the United States. However, analysts and U.S. citizens seek to assess and measure the outcome of the presidential election, while there are still two years left until the presidential elections in the United States! It should not be forgotten that, in the 2016 presidential election, Trump didn’t really succeed in defeating his rival Hillary Clinton, and she has won the popular vote by more than 2.86 million ballots. However, Trump moved to the White House based on the Electoral College (which is an example of an objective violation of democracy in the United States). Trump has now received news on his declining popularity with American citizens in important and determining states. Under such conditions, most American analysts don’t predict a good, stable political future for their controversial president! What is certain is that Tramp will not have an easy path to win the upcoming presidential election.Public opposition to the policies of Donald Trump, the controversial president of the United States, is still on the rise. Polls conducted in the United States indicate that many of the American citizens who voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections, are now regretting their choice. In any case, Trump's controversial policies and actions such as his withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran and moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem have imposed hefty costs on U.S. domestic and foreign policy. This same issue has led to more anger and dissatisfaction with Trump in the United States. As Vox reported, The 2018 midterm elections are just getting rolling, but 2020 is on the horizon — and a new poll might give President Donald Trump something to sweat about. According to a Politico/Morning Consult survey released on Wednesday, just 36 percent of voters say they would vote for Trump over a generic Democratic candidate in the next presidential election, while 44 percent would pick the Democrat. One-fifth of voters still aren’t sure.While presidents typically don’t face a tough road to get their party’s nomination, six in 10 voters, including 38 percent of Republicans, say they’d like to see Trump get a Republican challenger in 2020. But it’s not clear whom they’d like to see take on the former reality television star. (And it looks like it is not going to be Vice President Mike Pence.) If it comes down to Trump and Pence, more Americans would prefer Trump keep the job of president over Pence. Thirty-four percent of respondents said they would have Trump, and 23 percent said they prefer Pence. (Forty-three percent said they didn’t know or were unsure.) As Politico notes, just because Trump isn’t particularly popular among voters doesn’t mean he couldn’t win. That’s what happened in 2016, when 38 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of him in exit polls and 61 percent said he wasn’t qualified to be president. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by about 3 million votes, but he did win the Electoral College. Of course, there were some specific circumstances in 2016 that are unlikely to be repeated in 2020 — both Trump and Clinton were historically unpopular candidates, and there was a surge in third-party voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. And, of course, there was the now-infamous letter from then-FBI Director James Comey announcing that the Clinton email investigation would be reopened days before the election. But Trump does better than a generic Republican against a Democrat in a theoretical 2020 matchup, according to Wednesday’s poll. Twenty-seven percent of voters say they would support a Republican candidate who isn’t Trump over a Democrat, while 40 percent say they would rather have the Democrat. One-third of voters aren’t sure. Trump has been ramping up 2020 campaign efforts essentially since day one — he filed paperwork for his reelection the same day he was inaugurated. He has kept up fundraising, ending 2017 with $22 million in cash, and he has had multiple campaign rallies across the country. Finally, many analysts believe the Democrats' performance (if they win the congressional elections) will remain decisive over the remaining two years before the end of the Trump presidency, as a result of the presidential elections of 2020. However, if the Democrats fail in Congressional midrange elections and Republicans win the congressional majority again, Democrats will have little chance of winning the upcoming U.S. presidential election.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
