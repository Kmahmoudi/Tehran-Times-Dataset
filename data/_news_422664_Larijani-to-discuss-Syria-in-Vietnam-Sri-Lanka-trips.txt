TEHRAN – Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani says he would discuss the latest developments in Syria in meetings with the Vietnamese and Sri Lankan officials in his tour to Hanoi and Colombo.

 “One of the most important issues in talks with Vietnamese and Sri Lankan officials will be the Syrian issue,” Larijani said before departing Tehran for Hanoi on Sunday. Pointing to the U.S.-led missile attack against Syria on Saturday morning over alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian army, Larijani said the move meant disrespect for international rules and could leave destructive impacts on future conflicts.
