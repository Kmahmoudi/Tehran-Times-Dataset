People cross an elevated suspension bridge that spans Darreh Khazineh, a steep canyon in western Iranian Lorestan province, August 26, 2017. The 112-meter-long bridge is said to be the most elevated one in the Middle East, with an altitude of more than 85 meters over Seymareh River. Â  The bridge is named after Khazineh village, itself a tourist hub located somewhere in the middle of a road that connects Andimeshk to Pol-e Dokhtar. Lorestan province, in the middle of the Zagros mountain range, acts as a gateway to the sweltering plains below the adjoining Khuzestan province.
