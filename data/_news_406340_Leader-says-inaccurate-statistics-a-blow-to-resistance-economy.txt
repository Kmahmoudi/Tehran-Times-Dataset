TEHRAN – In comments on Tuesday Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution underscored that a successful implementation of the resistance economy hinges upon “accurate statistics and information.”  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the remarks during a meeting with the officials of the Supreme Statistics Council, Statistical Center of Iran, as well as Population and Housing Census Headquarters. “The prerequisite for the realization of resistance economy is the availability of accurate statistics and information on the condition of domestic production and manufacturing businesses and their needs,” the Leader noted.   Iran will start its 8th national census on October 16, which will last one month. The first census in Iran was documented in 1956 with 10-year intervals until the last two decades when the interval was reduced to 5 years given the country’s population growth.  Leader says, “The prerequisite for the realization of the resistance economy is the availability of accurate statistics and information on the condition of domestic production and manufacturing businesses and their needs.” Ayatollah Khamenei stressed that any decision-making in the country should be premised upon “accurate, centralized, and scientific statistics and information,” urging the people to actively answer questions in the incoming national census. “For the decision-making in the country to be correct, right, and efficient, all the people both participate in the significant plan and provide statistical bodies with required accurate data statistics and information and as the officials have said the statistics are confidential,” the Leader explained.  On the uses of national censuses, the Leader highlighted the importance of analyzing statistics in order not to be “caught off guard.”  Both the current situation (of the country)and the trend of changes should be worked out of the statistics so as for the country’s officials and decision makers not to be caught off guard because of the trend of changes in the present world where the pace of changes is very high, he said.     The Leader further warned of statistical differences expressed by different authorities and organizations, calling it “a big scourge” which can breed mistrust among the people.  “Sometimes, various centers announce different statistics on unemployment rate, inflation, and economic growth that cause mistrust among people.”  Referring to statistical accusations against each other, the Leader called for identifying the source of such inconsistencies.  “The source of the dualism should be identified. That is, there have been faults either in that period or the following period, and manipulating statistics which are subject to the judgment of the wise people is a cardinal sin anyway.”  AK/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
