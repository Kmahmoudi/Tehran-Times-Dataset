TEHRAN – Major General Mohammad Baqeri, chief of the Iranian armed forces, said on Tuesday that the Islamic Republic will not remain silent in the face of the United States’ “foolish” move to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization. In retaliation, Iran “has also labeled the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) in West Asia as a terrorist organization and if they make a mistake, we will deal with them decisively,” Baqeri stated. The fact that the IRGC has been targeted by the “criminal” American regime is worth feeling happy about, the commander remarked.  It means that the IRGC has been in the right path all along, he added.
