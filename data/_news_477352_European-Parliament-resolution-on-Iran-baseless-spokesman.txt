TEHRAN – Iran has reacted to the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on Thursday, calling it “baseless” and “meddlesome.” In a statement on Friday, Nasser Kanaani, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said, “This resolution encompasses unilateral and baseless presumptions about the Islamic Republic of Iran and thus is basically rejected and lacks in value.”  He added, “Despite the claims made in it, this resolution criticizes the necessary countermeasures against organized violent actions and attacks on public property and people's lives and property under false and unfair titles at a time when the plotters and provocateurs of the riots are perpetrating their hostile measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran mainly from Europe.”   Kanaani noted, “By issuing this resolution, the European Parliament showed that it continues its selective behavior towards the great nation of Iran. Because it was never seen that this Parliament issued a human rights resolution in opposition to the maximum anti-human sanctions against the people of Iran, despite its pompous allegations.” Kanaani underlined that investigations into the death of Mahsa Amini are underway based on Iran’s internal legal requirements, not the wishes of others. He added that the death of Amini is a mere pretext for the European Parliament to continue its hostility toward the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The statement also said Iran, while ready for mutual cooperation, will strongly resist any efforts to pressure it and will proportionately respond to these efforts.  In its Thursday resolution, the European Parliament condemned the death of Amini and accusing Iran of killing her and “quashing the ensuing street protests.” The resolution called for sanctions on Iran. The European Parliament further called on “the United Nations, and in particular its Human Rights Council, to initiate an investigation into recent events in Iran.” “MEPs also urge EU member states with a diplomatic presence in the country to coordinate their actions in order to protect human rights defenders, in particular women’s rights defenders, and EU-Iranian dual nationals,” the Parliament said in statement after adopting the resolution.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
