TEHRAN – Iran defeated Iraq 1-0 to book their place in the 2022 FIFA World Cup on Thursday.  Iran were dominant in the first half and created several chances in front of more than 10,000 fans in Tehran’s Azadi Stadium but Iraq custodian Fahad Talib kept them in the game. With three minutes into the second half, Mehdi Taremi found the back of the net, unleashing a right-footed strike into the area. The home win put Dragan Skocic’s men at least 10 points clear of third place with just nine points remaining to compete for.  Iran will participate in the FIFA World Cup for the sixth time. The Persians booked their place in the 1978 FIFA World Cup for the first time. Iran waited 20 years to make it happen once again when they advanced to the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France.
