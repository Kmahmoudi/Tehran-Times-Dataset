The UN atomic watchdog issued a report on Friday confirming that Iran is complying with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the official name for the nuclear deal.
 According to the JCPOA, which went into effect in January 2016, Iran has to slow down its nuclear activities. A confidential report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) obtained by Reuters made clear Iran’s official stock of enriched uranium has fallen by half.  “As of 18 February 2017, the quantity of Iran’s uranium enriched up to 3.67 percent U-235 was 101.7 kg,” the IAEA said in a quarterly report on Iran, its first since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. The IAEA’s report is issued as fears have been heightened the U.S. may walk out of the milestone pact. Even before the conclusion of the nuclear deal, repeated reports by UN watchdog body failed to produce the least evidence that that Iran’s nuclear program has diverged from its rightful course.  The nuclear deal, which was struck between Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany – in July 2015, reassured the world of the peaceful nature of Tehran’s nuclear program. The IAEA has said that its inspection of Iran’s nuclear activities is unprecedented in the history of the UN body. NA/PA
