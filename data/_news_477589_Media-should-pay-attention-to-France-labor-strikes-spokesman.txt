TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani has called on media outlets to address the labor strikes in France’s oil and gas sector. In remarks to state news agency IRNA, Kanaani pointed to the French authorities’ threat to forcibly end the strikes, saying this should be addressed by the media.  “Labor strikes in France’s oil and gas sector and the French authorities’ threat to use force in order to put an end to the strikes deserve media coverage,” Kanaani said.  Workers of French oil and gas giants have gone on strikes in the past two weeks, demanding salary increases amid a cost-of-living crisis. French officials have warned they would move to end strikes.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
