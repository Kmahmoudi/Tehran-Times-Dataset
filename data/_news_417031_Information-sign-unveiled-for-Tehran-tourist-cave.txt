TEHRAN -- An information sign was unveiled on Thursday for Roodafshan, a cave located in Damavand, eastern Tehran, enlightening tourists about its geographical and historical characteristic as well as some safety rules for caving. Designed by the Iranian Cave and Speleology Association, the sign is said to be the first of its kind in Iran, Mehr reported. The unveiling ceremony was held on the occasion of the National Clean Cave Day, which is commemorated on September 23.  “We don’t plan to damage caves with turning them into tourist places,” Tehran tourism chief Rajab Ali Khosroabadi said on the sidelines of the ceremony. He said that for development of tourism industry, the department of environment should announce methods for preservation of tourist attractions and natural resources in particular. During the ceremony, the head of Iranian Cave and Speleology Association proposed temporary closing of the cave so that locals learn how to preserve the cave environment. The National Clean Cave Day was registered on Iranian calendar in 2016 with the purpose of raising public awareness about the value of caves and creating a culture of protecting these ecosystems.
