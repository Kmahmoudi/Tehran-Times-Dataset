TEHRAN - The mid-term elections in the United States ended with the majority of Republicans in the Senate, and Democrats' victory in the House of Representatives. Democrats in the House of Representatives are now preparing themselves to confront Trump and challenge his position at the White House, as they seem to be disappointed with the resistance of the Senate to Trump and his friends. Describing the political sphere ruling over the U.S. House of Representatives, the Washington Post writes; " Democrats took control of the House on Tuesday night, a victory that will transform a Republican-controlled chamber that supported and protected President Trump into a legislative body ready to challenge and investigate him."  The Democrats intend to quickly start with a legislative package of anti-corruption measures aimed at strengthening ethics laws, protecting voter rights and cracking down on campaign finance abuses. Washington reports; “Tomorrow will be a new day in America,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared from the Democratic Party headquarters in Washington. “It’s about restoring the Constitutions' checks and balances to the Trump administration. It’s about stopping the GOP and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell’s assaults on Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the health care of 130 million Americans living with preexisting medical conditions.” In another report, the Washington Post focused on the angry stances some of the new representatives of the House took in facing the U.S. President; "Energized by their success in last week’s midterms and courting potential primary voters outraged by the actions of the Trump administration, virtually every Democrat considering a White House run is talking about fighting in one form or another — and trying to prove he or she is prepared for the match... Some, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have taken aggressive stances that suggest a willingness to take on Trump directly." It's to be noted that on election night, Warren said that Trump and his “corrupt friends” took the past two years “building a wall of anger and division and resentment.” In her remarks, she pointed to the “fight” ahead more than two dozen times. The Democrats are also planning to investigate Donald Trump's administration, and their potential targets include Russian interference, tax returns, money paid to individuals to keep them silent over the president's moral corruption, security clearances, etc. The Washington Post wrote accordingly; "Democrats are likely to launch investigations into numerous aspects of the Trump administration, from its ties to Russia to the president’s tax returns, as well as to step up oversight into Trump’s executive actions on immigration, the environment, and other regulations." Gerry Connolly, the Democrat Representative said; “Obviously the country gave us the mandate to provide some check and balance on the executive that that has been sorely missing these last two years, and that involves rigorous oversight and accountability." He added; "This is not a time for holding back or being less than vigorous.” Evidences suggest that in the coming weeks, the first phase of disputes between the House of Representatives and the White House will start. Democrats in the House of Representatives have threatened that they don't let the White House be indifferent to them. By this, they're referring to issues such as the GDP management which can disturb the activity of the government.  ​ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
