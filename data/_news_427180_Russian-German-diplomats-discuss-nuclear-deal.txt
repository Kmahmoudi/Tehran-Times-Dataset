Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Antje Leendertse, director of the political directorate-general of Germany’s Federal Foreign Office, discussed the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 “Both sides stressed the importance of keeping the JCPOA in place. A number of other aspects of arms control and non-proliferation were touched upon,” TASS quoted the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the nuclear agreement in May and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran. The first batch of sanctions took effect on August 6. The European Union trio – Germany, France and Britain which are signatory to the nuclear deal - are expected to present their package of proposals to Iran before the second round of U.S. sanctions takes effect in early November.  The November sanctions target Iran’s central bank and oil exports. The package must facilitate banking transactions and oil trade. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last week that Iran will abandon the nuclear deal if it does not safeguard the country’s interests.
