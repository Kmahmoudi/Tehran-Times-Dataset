Rapporteur of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of Majlis Kazem Jalali told Majlis open session that the case had already been raised when Kamal Kharrazi was Iran's foreign minister, who had in response put the extent of damage at more than one thousand billion dollars directly and more than one thousand billion dollars indirectly. He said that documents related to the damage are available at the UN. He blamed the UN, especially the UN Security Council, double- standards and unsuitable international conditions for Iran's failure to receive reparations from Iraq. He added that former Iraqi regime of Saddam had paid Kuwait for the damages caused during the invasion of that country. The Iranian lawmaker suggested formation of a committee, comprising representatives from Foreign Ministry, Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Commission and the Supreme National Security Council, to examine ways of receiving war reparations from Iraq. He said the committee can also follow up dredging Arvandroud border river, swapping the remaining prisoners of war and presence of the outlawed terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq Organization in Iraq.
