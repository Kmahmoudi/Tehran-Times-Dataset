In an article published on Friday, Lobelog said the efforts being made by the European Union to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal are actually a “battle to save” the world order.
 “Ultimately, for the EU the fight to preserve the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] has become about something bigger than just a non-proliferation agreement with Iran. It’s a battle to save the rules-based, multilateral world order from an assault by those who seek to dismantle it,” the article said. The Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action held its first meeting at the foreign ministerial level in Vienna on Friday after the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in May. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini announced that Iran and the remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear agreement had agreed to continue negotiations, including on economic measures, over how to save the deal. The nuclear deal, struck in July 2015 between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The agreement was endorsed by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. The deal went into force in January 2016.
