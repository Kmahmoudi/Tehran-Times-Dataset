TEHRAN – A new chapter of restoration work has commenced in UNESCO-registered Ali Qapu Palace in Isfahan. Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization has accolated 2 billion rials (some $47,000) to the scheme with the aim of restoring its wall engraving and paintings. “The rehabilitation project includes chemical and physical cleansing, solidification, alignment and finishing of historical layers,” CHTN quoted Fereydoun Allahyari, Isfahan province’s tourism chief, as saying on Monday. Built at the very end of the 16th century as a residence for Shah Abbas I, a Safavid king, the six-storey palace overlooks Imam Square. Profusion of tree-lined boulevards, Persian gardens and important Islamic buildings give Isfahan a highly touristic appeal that is unmatched by many other Iranian cities.
