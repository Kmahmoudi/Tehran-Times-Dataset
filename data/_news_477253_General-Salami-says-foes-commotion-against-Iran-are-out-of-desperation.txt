TEHRAN - Chief of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) warned foreign powers on Sunday against plotting against the Islamic Republic, reminding that enemies have launched a political and media campaign to make up for their failures. “I can see with my own eyes and say that [the United States of] America has failed. All evil and wicked parties of the world have, therefore, come together to compensate for their defeats. They have embarked on a political and media campaign [against Iran],” Major General Hossein Salami said at a ceremony in the capital Tehran. Pointing to the root causes of the recent unrest in certain cities in Iran, the top general said, “One could see the manifestation of enemies’ onslaught aimed at making up for their humiliating defeats. They do not want to allow the existence of a powerful, influential, and sovereign country ruled by Islam.” The IRGC commander went on say that Washington sees Iran as the chief hurdle for advancing its policies in the West Asia region. “Americans view our regional clout as a major obstacle to their political, security, economic and cultural hegemony in the Muslim world, which is the most important part of the world,” Press TV quoted General Salami as pointing out. He added that the U.S. statesmen are trying to stop Iran's influence in West Asia because they want to prolong their stay in the region, induce the nations, impose their diktats on them and advance their agendas. “Americans want to mobilize our youths against the Islamic establishment by means of trickery and deception. This is the last policy of enemies. They are betting on a combination of anything employed before. But we have the experience and that would be enough to know enemies. Lack of knowledge is the cause of failure, while knowledge always ensures victory,” Salami stated. “The few number of Iranian youths wreaking havoc on streets across the country has actually been deceived,” Salami said, noting that Iranians know how to defeat their enemies. “We warn our enemies, America, England, Saudi Arabia, and those who are trying to harm our country through destructive and vicious media outlets that we will trounce you. There is no way to infiltrate into this land,” the general said. The IRGC chief underlined that Iranians from all walks of life are aware of foreign conspiracies against the Islamic Republic. He vowed revenge and massive retaliation against enemy actions, whether it be the downing of an unmanned aerial vehicle or a terrorist attack on a police station in the southeastern city of Zahedan, the capital of the border province of Sistan-Baluchestan. Protests have broken out in several Iranian cities over the September 16 death of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian woman who died at the hospital three days after collapsing at a police station in Tehran, where she and a group of others were receiving training on dress code rules. Despite Iranian officials’ clarification on the circumstances surrounding the Amini death, violent street protests have led to attacks on security officers and acts of vandalism against public and private property. Also late on Saturday, the secretary general of Lebanon’s Hezbollah resistance movement denounced the United States over its stances and interference in the wake of the death the young Iranian woman, saying Washington is pursuing wicked seditious plots in order to sow the seeds of discord and create rifts in the Islamic Republic. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah made the remarks in a televised speech broadcast live from the Lebanese capital city of Beirut as he addressed participants of a ceremony in commemoration of late Shia Muslim cleric Sayyed Mohammad Ali al-Amin, who passed away in July. “The United States exploits any incident in Iran in order to provoke the nation against the Islamic establishment, the latest of which is the protests that have broken out following Ms. Amini’s tragic death. “U.S.-backed vandals took advantage of the unclear circumstances surrounding her death to challenge the Islamic Republic after their so-called campaign of maximum pressure dismally failed,” he said. On Friday, terrorists launched armed attacks on several police stations and public places in Zahedan after Friday prayers in the city, killing 19 people and injuring 20 others. Sistan Baluchestan’s Governor Hossein Modarres Khiabani said, “A number of rioters affiliated with terrorist and separatist groups, whose identities are clear” attacked the police station and threw stones and opened fire, provoking a severe reaction by police forces.” The terrorists also set ablaze a fire engine, an emergency station, and a bank, among other places in the city but their attempts to continue rioting failed following the timely presence of security forces. In a statement, the so-called Jaish ul-Adl separatist and the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack in Zahedan.
