TEHRAN – Head of the Iranian High Council for Human Rights has criticized the UN Special Rapporteur-designate for Human Rights in Iran Asma Jahangir, saying she is “politicizing” human rights issue.  In a letter addressed to United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid bin Ra'ad al-Hussein, Mohammad Javad Larijani described Jahangir’s latest remarks as “completely false, unjustified and disappointing”, ISNA reported on Monday. Before publishing reports on the human rights conditions in Iran, the body should inform Tehran of every kind of its allegations so that the Islamic Republic can explain, Larijani remarked. Larijani said Mrs. Jahangir is not treating Iran professionally and fairly that is required of someone in her position. The continuation of such trends could undoubtedly reduce the credibility of that council from an official body to a politicized one, the senior rights official said. He also said Iran’s human rights council will provide a clear, unambiguous response to the allegations made by Mrs. Jahangir.
