TEHRAN- European intrusion into Iranian domestic issues, according to the Iranian foreign minister, is unacceptable because Iran has one of the region's most robust democracies. The comments were made by Hossein Amir Abdollahian during a phone call on Thursday with José Manuel Albares, his Spanish colleague, in which the two top diplomats discussed topics of concern to both countries. The Islamic Republic's membership in the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) of the United Nations was revoked earlier this month, and Amir Abdollahian condemned Western nations for the action, saying it demonstrated efforts to sabotage the chance for discussion. Amir Abdollahian said, “Iran has one of the strongest democracies in our region, and it is not appropriate for us that Europe tends to perceive events from a skewed perspective and continues to intervene in Iran's internal affairs.” The senior Iranian diplomat also wished the government and people of Spain a happy new year and expressed hope that 2023 will provide chances for furthering Iran's relations with Spain as well as promoting international peace and stability. For his part, the Spanish foreign minister discussed topics of shared interest and wished Iranian Christians a happy new year. Albares emphasized that Madrid will use all reasonable efforts to carry on talks and forge connections with Iran. Following a draft request by the United States about what it alleged  "measures adverse to the rights of women and girls" in the country, Iran was expelled from the UN Commission on the Status of Women on December 14. Iran was removed from the UN group representing women by 29 members; eight nations opposed it, and 16 abstained. Iran condemned the action, asserting that Washington and its allies are "in no position" to defend women's rights while also endorsing Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children and women over a long period of time. Iranian FM speaks on the phone with Omani counterpart Amir Abdollahian and Sayyid Badr al-Busaidi, his Omani counterpart, also conversed over the phone separately on Thursday to discuss and share opinions on the most crucial matters of shared concern. The two senior diplomats stressed the need of ongoing talks on topics of mutual concern and those that are in the interests of the two nations and other regional governments as they discussed the most recent regional and global events. “Iran sees no restrictions on strengthening ties with Luxembourg” Amir Abdollahian and his Luxembourgian counterpart Jean Asselborn also spoke on Thursday over the phone on important topics of relevance to both countries.  Amir Abdollahian said that his nation sees no restrictions on developing ties with Luxembourg. The bilateral consultations need to continue in the future, the Iranian foreign minister said, referencing his "good" discussions with his Luxembourgian counterpart in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. On his part, Asselborn emphasized the value of connections between the two nations and shared his opinions on topics of common concern. Iran, Dutch FMs urge expanding ties In a phone conversation on Thursday night, the foreign ministers of Iran and the Netherlands also emphasized the need to expand comprehensive bilateral ties. Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra and Amir Abdollahian discussed the most significant problems in their respective countries' bilateral and global interests. The senior diplomat for Iran stated that Tehran is ready for continued growth of bilateral ties and highlighted the nearly 400-year history of contacts between Iran and the Netherlands. Amir Abdollahian meanwhile wished the Dutch government and people a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. For his part, the Dutch foreign minister made a reference to the long history of the two countries' relations, reiterating that his nation supports the continuation of bilateral discussions regarding political and consular problems. In the meanwhile, he wished Iran's people and government a happy welcome to the Christian New Year, particularly its Christian population. Amir Abdollahian concerned about health of Iran envoy to China  Following a fresh outbreak of Covid-19 illness in China and the infection of the Iranian ambassador and six embassy personnel, the foreign minister inquired about their health over the phone. Amir Abdollahian welcomed the Chinese hosts' support in this respect during a phone conversation with Ambassador Mohammad Keshavarz-Zadeh, who inquired about his and his colleagues' health. The ambassador also thanked the foreign minister and assured him that the embassy will do everything possible to protect Iran's national interests, particularly in the worldwide battle against the Covid-19 epidemic.
