TEHRAN - Amer Al-Fayez, an Iraqi MP, has said that the Iraqi government intends to send a delegation to Washington to discuss Iran sanctions waiver for Iraq.
 In an interview with the al-Maloomah news agency, he said Iraqi President Barham Salih may head the delegation. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iranâ€™s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. The U.S. initially granted Iraq a 45-day waiver to allow it carry on buying electricity and gas from its neighbor. In December, the U.S. granted Iraq a 90-day Iran sanctions waiver to allow it to continue to import electricity from Tehran. The U.S. has granted waivers to several buyers to meet consumer energy needs. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
