TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Sunday condemned recent anti-Iran allegations by the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, saying Yemeni missiles have nothing to do with Iran. Nikki Haley on Thursday claimed that Iran has violated the UN Security Council resolutions by providing Yemen’s Houthis with missiles to target Saudi Arabia. IRGC spokesman Brigadier General Ramazan Sharif said it is no secret to anyone that Yemen had been equipped with missiles from the Soviet Union and North Korea. “The American envoy shows a tube and says there are Iranian fingerprints on it, while it is a widely-known fact that Yemen had received cutting-edge missile technologies from the Soviet Union and North Korea in the past,” Sharif was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. He also denounced Washington for arming Saudi Arabia, saying the kingdom has been bombarding Yemeni people for more than two years with American weapons. The West’s mainstream media, the general said, serves as a propaganda wing which covers up the criminal conducts of the U.S., Europe and the terrorist groups in the region. They do not allow the general public to find convincing answers for their questions, he added.
