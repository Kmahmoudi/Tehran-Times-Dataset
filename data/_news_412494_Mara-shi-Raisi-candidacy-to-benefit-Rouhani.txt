TEHRAN – A member of the central council of the Servants of Construction Party believes the coming of Ebrahim Raisi, currently custodian of the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, will benefit Hassan Rouhani in the upcoming presidential election.

 Speaking in an interview with the Shargh daily published on Sunday, Hossein Mar’ashi said the Popular Front of Revolution Forces, which gave the highest number of votes to Raisi in the primary election on Thursday, does not represent all principlist groups. Also, he said, the front does not have anything unique to be valuable to principlists of other groups.
