TEHRAN – Bank Melli of Iran has printed 200 million ballots to be used in the upcoming elections, the bank’s printing and publication director Reza Mansuri said on Wednesday.

 The ballots have the highest security parameters and contain anti-counterfeiting print elements, Mansuri said, according to the BMI website. The security elements have been used in the paper pulp, printed figures, as well as the ink used for printing so that the ballots cannot be printed anywhere else, the official said. SP/PA
