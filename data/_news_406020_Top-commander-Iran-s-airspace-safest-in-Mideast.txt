TEHRAN – Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base top commander Sayyed Mahdi Hosseini underlined on Friday that Iran has the safest airspace among the countries of the Middle East, ISNA reported. Addressing worshippers at the weekly held Friday prayer, Brigadier General Hosseini stressed the role that the country’s air defense base plays in thwarting “empty threats posed to Tehran by its enemies.” 
“The Islamic Republic has been able to boost its defense prowess through developing homegrown missiles,” Hosseini said. 
Iran has recently revealed its first long-range air defense missile system, manufactured by Iranian specialists. The air defense pack, dubbed Bavar-373, is designed to target drones and missiles, as well as combat aircraft at various altitudes. 
“At this point in time, while terror is prevalent in the Middle East as well as other countries throughout the world, Iran’s air defense base has managed to up the security of the Iranian skies to highest level in the region,” the top Iranian commander said, touching upon the Islamic Republic’s deterrent missile capabilities. 
Tehran’s missile capabilities have been a potential source of controversy between Iran and the West. This is while Tehran has repeatedly insisted that the capabilities are merely of defensive essence.
