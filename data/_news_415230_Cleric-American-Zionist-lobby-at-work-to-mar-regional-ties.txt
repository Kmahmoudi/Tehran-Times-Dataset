TEHRAN – The American-Zionist is doing its utmost to damage relations between Iran and its neighbor, Tehran Friday prayer leader Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said.  “It is crystal clear that American-Zionist lobby does its best to tarnish Iran’s relations with its neighboring countries,” Khatami said, a reference to Kuwait’s decision to order Iran to reduce its embassy staff in the country after an Iranian was reportedly found implicated in a terror cell in 2015.  Iran has strongly objected to the decision, rejecting any implication in the case.  PA/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
