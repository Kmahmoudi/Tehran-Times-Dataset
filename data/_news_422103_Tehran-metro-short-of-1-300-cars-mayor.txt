TEHRAN — The Tehran metro is experiencing overcrowding as it is short of some 1,300 cars, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Ali Najafi said. Najafi made the remarks over an unveiling ceremony of 46 new cars on Thursday.  The necessary infrastructure is in place, however, the public transport system is affected by shortage, for one the buses are old and scanty and must be replaced, Najafi stated, Mehr news agency reported.  Among numerous reasons behind air pollution, especially in the metropolis of Tehran, the transport sector, namely buses operating on fossil fuels and inefficient subway system, can be partly deemed as guilty parties. Limited, shoestring budget has hampered the sector, the mayor noted, adding each car is valued at 1.1 million euros and the municipality’s budget is only enough to buy some 3 cars.  Lately China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation Changchun Railway Company (CRRC CRC) and Tehran Wagon Company have won the tender to build and supply 630 cars for the Tehran Subway, the mayor added.  According to the director general of Urban Rail Transportation Bureau of Iran’s Urban and Rural Municipalities Organization affiliated with the Interior Ministry, the project is worth more than €782.66 million and will be financed by the Chinese side. However, the cars will be added to the transport system within the next 23 months, Najafi said.  While Tehran mayor resigned on Wednesday he will hold the post throughout the Noruz holidays so that the city council can both discuss his resignation and choose the next mayor if need be over its next session in early April.  MQ/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
