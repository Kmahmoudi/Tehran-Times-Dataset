TEHRAN – U.S. President Donald Trump’s failure to take legal actions against the nuclear agreement is a victory for Iran, an expert on international affairs says. The new sanctions that the United States imposed on Iran are illegitimate and showed that Trump’s threats were all bluff, Ali Khorram was quoted by ISNA as saying on Sunday. On Friday, Trump avoided upending the nuclear deal – also called the JCPOA – which he has repeatedly disparaged, agreeing to waive key sanctions the U.S. lifted as part of the deal. Khorram said by the new sanctions Trump was trying to satisfy himself. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
