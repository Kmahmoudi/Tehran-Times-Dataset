TEHRAN – The foreign ministers of Iranian and Saudi Arabia spoke over the phone on Sunday and agreed to hold a meeting in the coming days.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian expressed satisfaction with the positive developments in Tehran-Riyadh relations and reiterated Iran’s readiness to boost Iran’s neighborhood policy.  In this call, the two top diplomats reviewed the latest developments related to an earlier agreement to hold a joint ministerial meeting.  The two sides also agreed to hold the meeting in the coming days, according to the Iranian foreign ministry. Earlier, Amir Abdollahian had said that he was hashing out the details of arrangements for the joint meeting with his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan.  Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Amir Abdollahian said arrangements are being made about the time and venue of the meeting with his Saudi counterpart. He was responding to a question on the time and location of a planned meeting with his Saudi counterpart. “We are scheduled to have a (telephone) conversation with the Saudi counterpart within the next 48 hours and finalize (the time and place of meeting),” the Iranian foreign minister replied, according to Tasnim.  Last week, the Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers agreed in telephone call to meet in the fasting month of Ramadan in line with an agreement to resume ties between Tehran and Riyadh. Iran and Saudi Arabia have agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties after China brokered an agreement between the two countries in March.  The agreement to restore ties was declared on March 10 after five days of intensive talks in Beijing. The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) announced on March 27 that bin Farhan and his Iranian counterpart agreed in the telephone conversation to meet before the end of the holy month of Ramadan to implement the historic agreement to resume diplomatic ties between Tehran and Riyadh. Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian also congratulated the Iranian people on the 44th anniversary of the adoption of the Islamic Republic as the country’s official governing system, saying the Islamic Republic derives its legitimacy from the people. “The secret to the persistence of the Islamic Republic of Iran is the continuation of legitimacy and the strong and high vote of people for the sacred establishment,” he stated. The foreign minister also described the failure of the hostile polices against the Islamic Republic during the past 44 years as a result of the people’s trust in the system and their heartfelt support for the country.
