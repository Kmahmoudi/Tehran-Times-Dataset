The upper house of Russia’s parliament has prepared a statement urging the U.S. Congress to save the Iran nuclear deal from President Donald Trump, RIA Novosti reported. “The Federation Council addresses the U.S. Congress members with an urgent request to use all available resources and prevent the extremely dangerous situation,” the statement read. Earlier this months, Trump refused to formally certify Tehran’s compliance to the nuclear accord, warning that he might ultimately terminate the deal, also known as the JCPOA. That gave Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions against Tehran that were lifted under the JCPOA. “At present time the implementation of this agreement is under threat of complete failure because of U.S. President Donald Trump’s declared strategy concerning Iran that stipulates Washington’s unilateral actions that violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) up to full cancelation of U.S. participation in it,” the Russian senators said. They also urged the parliaments of other Western countries to “use the influence on political leaders of their countries in order to keep in force the historical deal concerning the Iranian nuclear program.”  They said that the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA would very likely prompt some reciprocal action from Iran. Under the nuclear agreement, endorsed by the UN Security Council, Tehran agreed to put limits on its nuclear activities in return for termination of economic and financial sanctions. The agreement signed in July 2015 went into force in January 2016. Top Iranian officials have already warned of the consequence of such actions, saying Iran was ready to respond to the possibility of U.S. government walking away from the agreement. Leader of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday responded to Trump’s decertification of the nuclear deal, saying, “We will not tear up the nuclear deal so long as the other side has not torn it up, but if they do, we will cut it into pieces.” The Leader added, “I don’t want to waste our time to respond to the rants and whoppers of the foul-throated president of the United States.”  Despite the Trump administration’s move, European countries have strongly supported the JCPOA, stressing the need to preserve it. On Sunday, in what appeared to be a shift in Trump’s tone toward the JCPOA, the U.S. president said he does not object to European countries’ trade with Iran. “I told them [the EU]: ‘Just keep making money. Don’t worry about it. We don’t need you on this,’” he told Fox News. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
