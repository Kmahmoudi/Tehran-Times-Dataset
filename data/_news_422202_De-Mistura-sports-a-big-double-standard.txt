Two months after the onset of the Turkish military invasion of the Afrin district in northwestern Syria which has left many Kurds wounded and many displaced from their towns, villages and farms, all of the sudden Staffan De Mistura, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Syria, has decided to show up but not to support Syrians, but to back terrorist armed groups in Syria’s Eastern Ghouta. The Syrian envoy has brought up the armed group’s request for talks with the Russian forces and his agreement over withdrawal of Takfiri terrorists from Jabhat al-Nusra and the Eastern Ghouta and called on the Syrian government to bow down to the terrorist groups and put a halt to the attacks on the armed groups. What’s pitiful is that De Mistura forgets the Kurds in Afrin and didn’t call on the Turkish army to cease its aggression and invasion of the region. De Mistura’s double standard and discriminatory stance on supporting the Eastern Ghouta’s terrorist armed forces and turning a blind eye to the Afrin region has to do with the Syrian’s army advances in the Eastern Ghouta and the liberation of 70 percent of the region, which has provided an opportunity for Syrians to seek refuge with the Syrian government. De Mistura admitted that the armed groups have targeted civilians of Damascus, Hamah, Daraa and Idlib in their attacks. Prior to Syrian advances, the West and the Arab supporters of the terrorists, in the context of massive propaganda, claimed that the civilian population of Ghouta was massacred by the Syrian army. However, truth was told when scenes of the massive escape of Syrians to freed suburban areas and their interviews with the Arab media revealed that the armed terrorists were taking people hostage and using them them as human shields. De Mistura is apparently trying to keep the remaining armed groups intact, but he has failed to mention the massacre of civilians in Afrin by the Turks. The “double standard” policy by the UN special envoy for Syria and the West in Syria stands as a clear testimony to the lies being disseminated about human rights, freedom and democracy for the Syrian people.
