TEHRAN – The mausoleum of Khajeh Atabak dating from the Seljuk dynasty (1037–1194) in Kerman province, southeastern Iran, has underwent restoration. The Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization and Kerman Municipality have jointly carried out the project. The octagonal mud brick structure is adorned with plaster and brick works as well as calligraphic ornaments both internally and on its facade. SeljuK Empire dominated parts of Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and most of Iran. Their advance marked the beginning of Turkish power in the Middle East. The last of the Iranian Seljuqs died on the battlefield in 1194, and by 1200 Seljuq power was at an end everywhere except in Anatolia. Since antiquity, big and sprawling Kerman province in southeastern Iran has been a cultural melting pot, blending Persians with some subcontinental tribes. It is home to many historical sites such as Bazaar-e Sartasari, Jabalieh Dome, Ganjali Khan Bathhouse and Malek Jameh Mosque to name a few.
