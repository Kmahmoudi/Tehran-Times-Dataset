Developing advanced technology in order to meet the nation’s communication needs and improving the accessibility of space services are some of the objectives of the country’s space technology sector, Ahmad Talebzadeh stated at a meeting of managers of the Communications and Information Technology Ministry. The limitations of educational institutions in training the required workforce, the tiny share of the private sector in the field, and the dearth of space technology resources in the country’s scientific centers are the major challenges faced by the country’s space program, he noted. Unfortunately, the government is overlooking the financial benefits that can be gained via establishing more satellite communications systems in competition with regional countries, he added. The space technology sector has been set up in line with the charter of the Iran Space Council and in accordance with article 8 of the law which defines the limit of authorities and duties of the Communications and Information Technology Ministry. The sector has been established for the peaceful utilization of space technology, the improvement of national security, and the organized implementation of space science and technology in the economic, cultural, and scientific spheres, Talebzadeh said in conclusion.
