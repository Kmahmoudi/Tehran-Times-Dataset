All of us should congratulate one another on our divine opportunity to enter the month of Rajab once more. The month of Rajab is an opportunity to get close to divine values and to God. It is an opportunity to engage in self-edification. The days which have been introduced as outstanding days in our narrations are all opportunities. Any opportunity is a blessing and any blessing requires that we thank God. Thanking God for His blessings means that we know blessings, behave according to their requirements, benefit from them, consider them as works of God and use them in His way. The month of Rajab is one of these blessings. The month of Sha'ban comes next and it is another blessing. From the viewpoints of saints, believers and mystics, these two months are an introduction to the month of Ramadan. The month of Ramadan is the month of transcendence, transcending, piety and purity and we need all these things. You should appreciate the month of Rajab. In this month, you should get close to the God of the creation as much as you can. You should remember God and carry out your tasks for the sake of Him. You should make efforts and work for the sake of God. Apr 26, 2015  The month of Rajab is a good opportunity. It is a month for dua, reliance on God, remembrance of God, and asking Him for forgiveness. We should constantly ask God for forgiveness. No one should think they do not need to do this. The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "Such darkness enters my heart that I ask God for forgiveness seventy times a day." Undoubtedly, even the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) used to ask God for forgiveness many times a day. Everybody should ask God for forgiveness. This is especially true for those of us who are immersed in material activities and the material world. Repenting can purge us of part of this engagement with the material world. Rajab is a month for repenting. By Allah's grace, we will make the most of this opportunity. I congratulate you on the arrival of the month of Rajab. I hope this month will be auspicious for all of us. I hope we will have finished part of our responsibilities by the end of this month and the beginning of Sha'ban. Jun 24, 2009 (source: khamenei.ir) All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
