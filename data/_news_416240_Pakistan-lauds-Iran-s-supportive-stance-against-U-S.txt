TEHRAN – Pakistani government spokesperson appreciated Iran’s firm stance on U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments against Pakistan in his new South Asia strategy. Marriyum Aurangzeb made the remarks while speaking to reporters during her visit to Iran-Pakistan Persian language study center in Islamabad. She also expressed willingness for closer ties between Iran and Pakistan, saying her country highly values its relations with the Islamic Republic. Earlier, the Iranian Foreign Ministry denounced the United States for its anti-Pakistan stance, and called on Washington to stop interfering in the internal affairs of regional countries and making decisions in their stead. “The U.S. condemns other states for what is the result of its own wrong and inappropriate policies for years in the region, particularly in Afghanistan,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Bahram Qassimi said in a statement on Thursday. He went on to say that Washington’s opportunistic strategies as well as its unilateral and meddlesome policies have only contributed to the current chaos and tensions and paved the way for growth of terrorism and extremism in the region. “The regional states enjoy a high capacity to cooperate in fight against terrorism and restore stability and security to the region, and there is no need for the U.S. destabilizing strategies which lead to the spread of terrorism,” he added.
