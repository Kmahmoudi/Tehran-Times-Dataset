TEHRAN- Russian Permanent Representative to International Organizations in Vienna Mikhail Ulyanov has stated that Russia supports the talks between Iran and the IAEA scheduled to take place in Tehran soon. "We welcome the IAEA and Iran negotiations that are scheduled to take place in Tehran in the coming days," he said. Speaking to TASS, he also said that “no one should anticipate any major developments during the consultations.”    The Russian envoy noted that the consultations had been set for the second half of November, but that the "untimely and counterproductive" resolution presented by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France at an IAEA Board of Governors session to lay pressure on Iran had forced the talks to be postponed. He went on to highlight, “It's promising that the interruption in discussions was brief. However, no one anticipates any breakthroughs at the impending summit. Still, it is hoped that it will pave the way for a more detailed and substantive dialogue to resolve the unresolved issues concerning the anthropogenic uranium particles discovered at some Iranian sites.” The Russian ambassador also stated that if both parties had political will, "all of these concerns can surely be handled." He added, “If done swiftly enough, it may help <…> bring a constructive aspect to discussions on reinstating the nuclear accord, which are now stalled but have the potential to provide a favorable conclusion.” On November 10, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi stated that talks with Iran had finished in Vienna bearing no fruit but that the parties will keep in touch. On the same day, Reuters, citing an IAEA report, said Tehran had consented to an IAEA visit to investigate the origin of uranium particles discovered at three nuclear sites. Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), has expressed hope the trip of the IAEA delegation would set Tehran and the Agency on a path to resolve the current outstanding issues. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Eslami voiced hope the upcoming visit of the IAEA officials to Tehran can help resolve issues with the Agency. “Our interactions with the Agency are underway and we hope a step forward be taken in the direction of addressing ambiguities and obstacles with the Agency,” the nuclear chief pointed out. On Saturday, Eslami also revealed that Iran’s enrichment capacity is now twice the total capacity Iran has earned since the inception of its nuclear program.
