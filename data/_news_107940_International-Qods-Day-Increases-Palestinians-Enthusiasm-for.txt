“The Qods issue is not only a Palestinian issue; it is a global issue. Everyone is aware of the importance of Imam Khomeini’s brilliant idea. The Imam considered the Qods issue to be the most important issue in the world of Islam and insisted that all Muslims should support the innocent Palestinian nation and foster unity among themselves for the liberation of Palestine,” Jamal said. By proposing such a day Imam Khomeini cuased all Muslims trying to take back Qods from the hands of the Zionist tyrants, he noted. Iran is the first defendant of Palestine and Intifadah and the Palestinians will always remember this support and affection, Jamal remarked. He said at this dangerous stage which Israeli plots against Palestine and Al-Aqsa mosque are looming to Qods and Intifadah which need much more support, he commented. Regarding the plans of the Zionists to change the Islamic structure of Beit-ul-Moqaddas into a Jewish one, the representative of Hamas in Yemen stated that Qods is an important and fundamental issue in the Islamic world and all Muslim countries and all major capitals of the world should support this issue on Qods day. Due to the constant brutality of the Zionist regime towards the Palestinian people, U.S. obvious support for Israel and Europe’s inattention towards human rights in occupied territories, the Qods day is considered as an important fact in raising the Palestinians’ spirits which would act as a remedy for the Palestinians’ miseries. “I believe that the voice of Qods will exceed the limits of Palestine in the Muslim capitals of the world. We expect all of the honorable and free people of the world, with any belief they may have, to perform their humane duty which is helping innocent and mistreated people.” The martyrdom of the Palestinian children is a small price which this nation is paying for the freedom of Qods and occupied lands and these sacrifices will continue until Palestine is freed and any resistance is always accompanied by sacrifice, he commented. “The constant brutality of the Zionist Regime will never damage the Palestinian willpower for continuing resistance and Intifadah because they are unjust and we are just and justice will always win over injustice and the Zionists have been left hopeless due to the constant fighting and resistance of the Palestinians.” “The Islamic Nation and the people of the world will hear the voices of the Palestinians on the International Day of Qods day and the people of Palestine will continue to fight for their rights. Victory is undeniable yet requires patience, strength and sacrifice and this patience requires time. Admiring the founder of the Islamic Revolution late Imam Khomeini, he said that “Imam Khomeini played a large part in the Palestinian cause and his motives were strong and formidable. Imam understood the importance of the Palestinian issue and chose a day as an International Qods Day. “This voice which has arisen from Iran has not only taken over the capitals of Islamic countries; it has even taken over the Western world,” the Hamas representative noted.
