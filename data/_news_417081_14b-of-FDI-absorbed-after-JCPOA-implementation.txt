TEHRAN- “Iran could attract $14 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI) after the implementation of its nuclear deal with the world powers- known as Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA)- in January 2016,”  Iranian Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri announced at the 11th edition of Iran’s International Exhibition of Plastics, Rubber, Machinery and Equipment (Iran Plast 2017) on Sunday. Tasnim news agency quoted him as saying, “$11.66 billion of investments have entered Iran and used on establishing factories and implementing industrial projects.” “Iran’s economy is now on the right track, despite the existing predicaments and criticisms,” Jahangiri said, “We can be converted into one of the economic poles in the globe.” “By the time being, we have negotiated with European and Asian banks for attraction of $60 billion, and have made agreements worth $26 billion with foreign banks. The government has issued guarantees to utilize the opened credit lines,” he added. HJ/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
