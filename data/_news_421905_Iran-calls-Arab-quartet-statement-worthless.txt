TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Thursday that Arab quartet’s anti-Iran statement is “worthless”, “illogical” and “lacks credibility”.
 The Arab Ministerial Quartet Committee, which is made up of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, issued a statement after a meeting in Cairo on Wednesday, accusing Iran of interfering with Arab internal affairs. The statement also claims that Iran is not serious in complying with the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “Iran must comply with implementation of Security Council resolution 2231 with regard to its missile program and the world community needs to carry out an effective mechanism to verify Iran’s implementation of the resolution, inspection and monitoring,” the statement reads according to Sputnik. Qassemi said that the Arab quartet member states are not qualified to talk about such issues. He said that the statement was issued to please the Zionist regime of Israel. He noted that the policy of Iranophobia is a “defeated policy”. “Based on the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Islamic Republic of Iran has fully met its obligations. Iran will continue fulfilling its commitments as long as the interests of the country are met,” Qassemi said. Elsewhere, he noted that Iran plays a “constructive role” in helping security and stability in the Middle East region. Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the U.S., UK, France, Russia, and China - Germany and the European Union struck the nuclear deal on July 2015.  The multilateral agreement has been approved by the UN Security Council. Since the JCPOA went into force in January 2016, the IAEA, as the United Nations’ nuclear monitoring body, has issued ten reports each time confirming Tehran’s complete compliance with the multilateral agreement.
