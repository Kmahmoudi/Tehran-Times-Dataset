TEHRAN -- The first biotechnology center in Iran for medical plant tissue culture was established in Birjand, eastern South Khorasan province, on Monday. Plant tissue culture is a collection of techniques used to maintain or grow plant cells, tissues or organs under sterile conditions on a nutrient culture medium of known composition. Launched by Iranian researchers, the center focuses on different species of jujube. Jujube trees grow in the arid and semiarid zones of Iran, especially in Birjand. Because of the plant's extensive utilization in food and pharmaceutical industries, production has increased sharply over the past decade. The vice president for science and technology, Sourena Sattari, attended the opening ceremony. The center is equipped with a hi-tech laboratory and a greenhouse.
