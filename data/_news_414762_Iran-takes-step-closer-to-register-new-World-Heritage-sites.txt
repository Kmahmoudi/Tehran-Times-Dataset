TEHRAN - Iran is further moving towards possible inscription of two new sites on the UNESCO World Heritage list as it has recently submitted associated dossiers to the famed international organization. “Two dossiers on ‘The Ensemble of Historical Sasanian Cities’ and ‘Arasbaran Protected Area’ have been submitted to the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [respectively],” Mehr quoted a senior heritage official on Sunday.   Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization Deputy Director Mohammad-Hassan Talebian added that the ICOMOS and the IUCN will dispatch delegations of experts to assess the sites and hold specific meetings with their Iranian counterparts during this summer. The ancient ensemble comprises several Sassanid-era (224–651) sites, namely Bishapour, Firouzabad and Sarvestan in Fars Province. According to its dossier the property embodies the political, historical, cultural and artistic developments of the Sasanian Empire, which was recognized as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighboring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire. Arasbaran Protected Area in the northwestern West Azarbaijan Province embraces one of the oldest brick domes in the world, a relatively exact circular urban terrain and some vestiges of other historical monuments. Measuring 78,560 hectares, Arasbaran is of high importance due to its rich flora and fauna in particular presence of rare species. There can be found some endemic plant species including long-leaved trees such as Juniperus foetidissima and endangered species such as Taxus baccata. The two sites are candidates for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage list for 2018. PHOTO: An undated photo depicts travelers visiting Arasbaran Protected Area in northwest Iran.
