TEHRAN –Yuram Abdullah Weiler, a U.S.-based international affairs analyst who occasionally writes for the Tehran Times, has written an open letter to U.S. officials urging them to open a way for relief aid for those hit by floods in Iran. 

 His letter reads as follows: Dear Official: Floods have inundated vast areas of Iran creating an environmental disaster, the scale of which necessitates an international humanitarian response. As your constituent, I am asking you to press the Trump regime to take action to relieve U.S. sanctions so that humanitarian aid can reach the Iranian people. Many Iranians are in desperate need of assistance now; flooding has killed dozens, displaced tens of thousands and cut off many areas of the country from relief efforts.  Due to unilateral U.S. sanctions, the Iranian Red Crescent - Iran’s affiliate of the Red Cross - has been cut off from global banking transactions, thus hindering their relief efforts. For the same reason, the United Nations has experienced complications that “affect the UN response and the accountability of UN to deliver the appropriate support.” Urgent relief to alleviate humanitarian catastrophes like the flooding currently afflicting Iran requires effort that should not be impeded by geopolitical self-interest. To show it is on the side of the Iranian people as claimed, the current Washington regime must take clear steps to broaden humanitarian exemptions to U.S. sanctions. Please urge key administration officials to take immediate action to expedite humanitarian assistance to Iran.
