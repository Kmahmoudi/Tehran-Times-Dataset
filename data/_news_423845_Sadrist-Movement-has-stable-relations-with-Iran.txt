TEHRAN – Dhia al-Asadi, head of the political bureau of the Sadrist Movement, has said that the movement has stable relations with Iran. Speaking with Al Mayadeen on Tuesday, al-Asadi also said, “We will never surrender to any foreign demands, whether from the United States or other countries,” ISNA reported. He also said Muqtada al-Sadr has no secret contacts with Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, Iraq’s electoral commission announced al-Sadr's coalition of secularists and Communists, Alliance of Revolutionaries for Reform, as the winner of the country's parliamentary elections.
