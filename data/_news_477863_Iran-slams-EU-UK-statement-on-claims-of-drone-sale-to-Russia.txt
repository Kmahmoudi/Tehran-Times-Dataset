TEHRAN- Nasser Kanaani, the spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, has vehemently repudiated a European Union (EU) and British statement that claimed drones built in Iran were being deployed in the conflict in Ukraine. Kanaani said on Saturday that the allegations are categorically untrue and that the British government's and the European Union's foreign ministers imposing further sanctions on Iran under such “bogus and baseless pretext” are categorically unacceptable. The official reiterated that Tehran rejects unfounded claims regarding the delivery of drones for use in Ukraine. He added that Iran supports peace and immediate secession of hostility in Ukraine through a political process and that Iran has been consistently emphasizing that all UN members should respect the goals and tenets of the UN Charter as well as international rights such as independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all countries. In an effort to establish an unfounded connection between their charges and UN Security Council Resolution 2231, the aforementioned parties (the EU and Britain) continue to foster an anti-Iran sentiment by presenting a fraudulent interpretation of the resolution, he cautioned. Resolution 2231 endorsed the international agreement that provided for termination of sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear program -- a deal that was later scrapped by former U.S. president Donald Trump. On Friday, France, Britain and Germany, know as the European troika, called in a letter to the United Nations for an investigation into Iranian drones the West claims Russia is using in the war in Ukraine. "We would welcome an investigation by the UN Secretariat team responsible for monitoring the implementation of UNSCR 2231," the UN ambassadors of the three countries wrote. Kanaani lambasted the European troika for their “irresponsible, destructive and illegal measures” to create “a poisonous political atmosphere” against the Islamic Republic. Iran has previously denied allegations it provided Russia with drones, asking Kiev to submit evidence of such drones if it has any. "We have told Ukrainian officials to produce any evidence on deployment of Iranian drones in the Ukraine war," Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Wednesday during a telephone conversation with his Croatian counterpart Gordan Grlic Radman.
