TEHRAN – Women make up 2,393 out of a total number of 36,165 village administrators in Iran, deputy director of the municipalities and village administration organization said on Friday. The number of female village administrators was 2,167 in the Iranian calendar year 1393 (March 2014- March 2015), IRNA quoted Saeed Reza Jandaqian as saying.  The provinces of Khorasan Razavi, Kerman, Mazandaran, Sistan-Baluchestan, and Gilan enjoy the highest number of village administrators respectively, he added. One of the most important essentials for achieving sustainable development is women’s involvement in management levels, Jandaqian emphasized. Village administrators, as representatives of two social groups of women and village managers burden the heavy responsibility of rural management, he concluded. Currently, more than 21.36 million people are living in 61,724 villages nationwide, making up 28.43 percent of the country’s total population, according to IRNA.
