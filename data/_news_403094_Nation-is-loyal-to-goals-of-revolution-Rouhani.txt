TEHERAN – President Hassan Rouhani told a cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the goals set by Imam Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, is strongly and perfectly followed by his successor Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
 “Today the path of Imam Khomeini is pursued by his competent successor very well in the country, region and the world,” the president remarked. The remarks by Rouhani came as the Islamic Republic on Friday will mark the memory of Imam Khomeini who died on June 3, 1989. “Our people learned very well from the Imam the lesson of resistance” in guarding the “independence and dignity” of the country, the president noted. He added the Islamic movement in Iran was not linked on any country or power and the Imam only relied on people. Imam Khomeini’s path is followed very well by Ayatollah Khamenei as the most qualified successor, president says Imam Khomeini succeeded to bring the Islamic revolution to fruition through bravery, resistance, and confidence in people, he pointed out. Imam Khomeini also founded the Islamic Republic system by turning to public vote and this showed his discretion in creating harmony between religious beliefs and democratic principles, Rouhani stated. He added the loyalty of the people to the principles set by Imam Khomeini shows that the Iranians are the most committed people to their “leadership” and they will not waver in this path. The president said the election of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the person to succeed Imam Khomeini in the shortest possible time was a “historic” move. “… the election of the most competent person by the Assembly of Experts heartened the friends of the Islamic Republic and disappointed the enemies which had pinned their hopes on the post-Imam days,” the president remarked. He added the election of Ayatollah Khamenei as the leader of the revolution at the “time of sorrow” created calm in the Iranian society. And the Iranian nation and officials, through the guidelines of the Supreme Leader, will continue to seek the ideals of Imam Khomeini. Rouhani also said implementing the policies of resistance economy, creating jobs for the youth, stimulating the economy and raising the people’s standard of living are among the main goals of the Islamic Revolution. “All these goals are achievable through unity, moderation, and coordination among all state bodies and people,” the president remarked.
