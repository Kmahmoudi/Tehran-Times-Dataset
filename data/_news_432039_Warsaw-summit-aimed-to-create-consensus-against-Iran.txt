TEHRAN – Hamid Aboutalebi, a political advisor to President Hassan Rouhani, said on Saturday the U.S. is trying to revive the Obama era’s global consensus against Iran through the Warsaw summit, after the Trump administration’s unilateral pressure against Iran failed.  In a string of tweets, Aboutalebi said the Trump administration is realizing that its unilateral sanctions have failed, therefore it decided to create division among European countries to unify them against Iran. And since Europe is aware of this, he continued, it should also know that the Iran nuclear agreement was the result of dialogue, “and to whatever extent the power of dialogue decreases, the power of challenge increases.” MH/NA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
