TEHRAN – A senior member of parliament on Saturday condemned the U.S. Senate’s recent move to approve a new sanctions bill targeting Tehran, saying the move is a “clear violation” of the July 2015 nuclear deal. Under the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to slow down its nuclear program in return for the termination of economic and financial sanctions. “The U.S. Senate’s recent approval of (new) sanctions against Iran is undoubtedly in clear violation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and contrary to its text and spirit,” said Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Parliament National Security and Foreign Policy Committee. The JCPOA - signed between Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany and the European Union – has been endorsed by the UN Security under the resolution 2231.  “Since the international document has been signed by all permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany and the European Union, all these signatories, too, should voice their opposition to the move and U.S.’s reneging (on its commitments under the deal),” Tasnim quoted the MP as saying. Boroujerdi further said that Iran will take necessary measures to counteract the sanctions bill. The Senate approved on Thursday the sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and alleged human rights violations. The U.S. legislation still must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law. Only two senators voted no the measure while 98 agreed to it. Republican Senator Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, were the only two "no" votes. The move has been criticized by many Iranian officials, saying breaches both the text and the spirit of the JCPOA.
