TEHRAN — Some officials believe that the long-term advantages of a probable flood in Iran’s capital, Tehran, outweigh its disastrous effects.
 Based on the figures announced by regional water company in Tehran water stored behind the five dams in Tehran measures at 322 million cubic meters while the overall capacity of the dams amount to 495 million cubic meters, IRNA news agency reported on Monday. This is while a great deal of water stored behind the dam was released to avoid the danger of flooding, the report highlighted. Mohammad Reza Bakhtiari director general of Tehran water and wastewater company also explained that should the city continue to receive precipitations all dams will be filled to their fullest extent by May 22. Thanks to the above normal precipitations water supply dams behind the dams are pretty much favorable, he added. Furthermore, some 35 million cubic meters of water flow into Bandali-Khan wetland in Varamin, southeastern Tehran, and restored the wetland after so many years. While Tehran is fighting land subsidence rainfalls can play a significant role in slowing down the process and stopping soil erosion as well. Director of Agriculture Organization of Tehran Province, Karim Zolfaqari, also told IRNA news agency that the loss inflicted upon farming lands in Tehran province is valued at 360 billion rials (nearly $8.95 million) which is nothing compared to the 230 trillion rials (nearly $5.5 billion) revenues made in agriculture sector in the province. Based on the latest data published on Sunday by National Drought Warning and Monitoring Center affiliated to Iran’s Meteorological Organization since the start of the current water year (September 23, 2018) the whole country received 293.7 millimeters of rain. The number amounted to 123.7 millimeters in the previous water year and 203.7 millimeters in the long-term, the data indicated. The numbers show a drastic increase of 137.5 percent compared to last water year. It also reveals a 44.2 percent increase compared to long-term means. The province of Tehran also received 310 millimeters of rain in the same period which indicates 113.5 percent rise compared to last water year and a 41.5 percent increase compared to the long-term averages. ----------------------Natural disasters advantages Natural disasters are environmental phenomena that are destructive and occur naturally. The disasters include floods, volcanic activity, hurricanes, droughts, and earthquakes. Owlcation.com writes while some of these disasters can be predicted and prepared for, they cannot be completely avoided and may lead to damage. Some disasters can be so devastating that it wipes out human life in some areas. Whatever the disaster may be, it affects societies both negatively and positively. The society and economy of a country suffers in many ways after a flood. The loss of lives, vegetation, and infrastructure means there will be fewer people on the labor force, less agriculture available for locals and exportation, and less businesses to contribute to the economy of the country. There will be mass dislocation of people, many of whom may be left homeless and jobless. In order to fill this gap the government will have to spend a little more. The country may seek assistance from foreign countries to supply food and materials to clean and replace infrastructure. While some countries will assist freely, some will charge for its efforts, putting the country in debt and at an economic loss. Nonetheless there are benefits of flooding despite its immediate ill effects. For farmers and those in the agricultural sector, it helps them in the long run by providing nutrients to the soil that were lacking. This makes the soil more fertile and increases agricultural production. Nutrients are also added to rivers and lakes, improving the health of fishes that can be consumed. There may be relocation of fishes and organisms living in water bodies. This may improve the ecosystem. New predators and prey are introduced to areas, balancing the aquatic population.
