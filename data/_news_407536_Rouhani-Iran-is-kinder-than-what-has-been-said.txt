TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani has said Iran wants peaceful coexistence with the countries in the region and the larger world, noting Iran is “kinder” than what has been said. Addressing a ceremony on the National Exports Day on Thursday, Rouhani said Iran’s relations with the world should be based on constructive interactions. He noted that expanding relations with the world would not be successful through disputes. “Iran is shouting with a loud voice that it is kinder than has been introduced to the world,” Rouhani said. He also said that the country should be more hospitable to tourists, so that businesspeople and entrepreneurs could travel to and from Iran without difficulty. Rouhani added that the government has been attempting to remove obstacles on the way of exporters, entrepreneurs, and businessperson on their banking relations. He further said that his government puts great emphasis on combating Iranophobia.  The president further underlined the country's openness to foreign investors and businessmen. “We should prepare the conditions for economic, scientific, and technological relations with the world,” Rouhani said. He went on to say that the atmosphere created after the nuclear deal is a good opportunity for the country to collaborate with foreign companies and investors. Rouhani has been trying to attract foreign investors into the country as last year’s nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), went into effect in January 2016. The JCPOA, which was reached between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council – the United States, France, Britain, China and Russia – plus Germany, has resulted in easing of sanctions as well as banking restrictions.
