A Saudi diplomatic delegation is set to go to Iran to assess damages to the kingdom’s diplomatic missions in Tehran and Mashhad, the Kuwaiti daily Al Jareeda reported on Saturday, citing Iranian sources close to the foreign minister.
 The delegation will fly to Tehran following Eid al-Adha, the daily said, Gulf News reported. The Saudi assessment team was initially scheduled to fly to Tehran two months ago, but the visit was postponed over differences between the Saudis and the Iranians regarding the program of the delegation and the meetings it would have with Iranian officials, the source said. The Saudi delegation wanted to meet judges and officials in charge of following up the attacks on the embassy in Tehran and the general consulate in the northeastern city of Mashhad, but the Iranian foreign ministry said it could not arrange the meetings, according to the source. Saudi Arabia severed its diplomatic relations with Iran in January 2016 following the twin attacks on its diplomatic missions by Iranians protesting the execution of a Saudi cleric among 47 prisoners. According to the source, tension between the two countries eased considerably recently during the preparations for the pilgrimage this year when Iranian Hajj officials and diplomats met Saudi officials to discuss arrangements for would-be Iranian pilgrims. The Iranian delegation reportedly commended in their report to the authorities the “highly positive” positions of the Saudis during the talks. An Iranian delegation is expected to visit Saudi Arabia following the mission by the Saudi assessment team amid hopes that the exchange of visits would mark the start of a new chapter in the relations between the two countries, particularly as bilateral contacts would be open and direct instead of via third parties. Iranians are looking forward to the visits succeeding in settling differences and the resumption of diplomatic ties, the source said, adding that the Iranians view the presence of the Saudi team in Iran as an indication of the kingdom’s intention to resume diplomatic relations.
