 The Bahman 22 rallies mark the victory of Islamic revolution in 1979. In the rallies on Sunday, Feb. 11, millions of people took to the streets in about 1000 cities and town renewing their loyalty to the Islamic Republic system  The text of the Leader’s message, appeared on his official website, is as follows: In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate Beloved and proud Iranian nation! Today, your resolve and insight gave rise to a great and stunning event. The greatness of your rallies today, which, according to meticulous estimators, was marked by a higher turnout and was more vigorous than those of the previous years, was a firm and crushing response to foreigners, enemies and the disloyal. By relying upon its defective and flawed assumption of Iran and Iranians, the enemy had mobilized all its capability and propaganda efforts to turn this year’s February 11 [rallies] into dull and maybe self-defeating ones. You showed off to them, in practice, the living and dynamic nature of the Revolution, and through your chants and warm participation shouted out loud your commitment to the ideals of the late Imam [Khomeini]. The grandeur of the Iranian nation drives the enemies back, and its resolute determination wrecks their calculations. The officials of the country must appreciate this unique phenomenon and serve the dear nation and defend the goals of the Revolution with full perseverance, a revolutionary spirit and diligence. The future belongs to our vigilant and insightful nation; we officials must strive not to fall behind the nation. “[Quranic verse] So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: For ye must gain mastery if ye are true in faith.”
