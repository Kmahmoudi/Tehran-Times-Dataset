TEHRAN - The European Union is still confused by the United States and Donald Trump's behaviors as President of this drawer. On the other hand, the White House sends Europe to Europe with dual parallelism and paradoxal flow.  Trump, on the one hand, continues its rigid economic policies towards Europe, and, on the other hand, talks about negotiating with Europe in the security and economic spheres!  This dual approach has not yet been thoroughly scrutinized by European authorities. The French PM Emmanuel Macron and British prime minister are still trying to look optimistic about the White House. They hope to deal with Trump on various issues. However, people like Angela Merkel have a more realistic approach to Tramp and his actions against Europe. In any case, as long as Europe fails to adopt a stubborn and powerful approach to the United States, Trump will take a firmer approach towards Europe.  It should not be forgotten that Tramp is opposed to the existence of the European Union. Something that some European politicians still do not understand! Tramp has repeatedly called for the destruction of the European Union and the eurozone in its speeches and behaviors. The support of the President of the United States and his entourage for the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union is also worthy of consideration. Many analysts of the international affairs have recently had a special focus on U.S.-EU relations! Some signals and speeches by the President of the United States which are addressed to the European authorities indicate the full opposition of the White House to the European Union. Over the past few days, there has been news about the specific talks between the President of the United States and some of the European Union’s member states. Trump called on French President “Emmanuel Macron” to leave the European Union and thus build wider bilateral relations with the United States!  On the other hand, Trump has officially asked the British Prime Minister “Theresa May” to sue the European Union rather than interacting with it. These are indications of the wide and extensive opposition of the United States to the United Europe. This confrontation can become a full-fledged dispute in the future. However, the European Union has not yet made a firm response to the United States, and it has adopted a policy of "having interactions with Tramp," but this policy can’t be adopted for a long time! EU member states, under the policies of politicians such as Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron, and even German Chancellor “Angela Merkel, have not yet used their capacities to confront the Trump’s government's actions and policies. It has reached a point where the British prime minister has asked other European countries to be silent against Washington regarding the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Europe! The fact is that some EU officials have been compromised with regard to the Trump government. In general, they have forgotten that the confrontation between Trump and Europe is fundamental! Undoubtedly, if European officials do not or cannot understand this fact, they will face crises in the near future: the crises that the Tramp government will create for them.
