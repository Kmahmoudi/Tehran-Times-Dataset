The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman on Sunday called for extension of truce between the Afghan government and Taliban in Afghanistan.

 Bahram Qassemi welcomed extension of the truce observed by the both sides over the Eid al-Fitr festivities period and urged both sides to respect the agreement. He expressed the hope that extension of ceasefire prepares the ground for start of a new and constructive process in the Afghan People's Dialogue on Peace. The spokesman also hoped that the ceasefire between Taliban and the Afghan government leads to sustainable peace and stability in the country. Afghanistan's government has extended ceasefire with the Taliban following an initial truce observed by both sides over the Eid period. However, 25 people died on Saturday in a suicide attack on one gathering of Taliban and government officials in Nangarhar. The Daesh (ISIS) terrorist group, which is active in the area, claimed responsibility for the attack.
