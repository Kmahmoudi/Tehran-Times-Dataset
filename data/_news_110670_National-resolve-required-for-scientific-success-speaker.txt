Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of a regional meeting dubbed ‘Regional Forum on Science and Technology Policy for Sustainable Development’ on Tehran University campus, he added that one of the most important duties of the policy-makers from developing countries in the field of science and technology is to brief people on the significance of science and the need to pay more attention to it. "Policy-makers should explain the role of science and technology in the prosperity and even survival of the community as well as national reputation and identity to make science a national requirement. "Meanwhile, the general conscience of the community should be rendered sensitive to science to materialize the significance of science and ensure its meritorious position in the self-consciousness of the community. "A nation with such an ideal will be persistent in promotion of science and technology, will put up with difficulties and will make devotion to make up for its historical backwardness," he added. He urged that nations should believe that they can make progress in the field of science and technology, given that self-confidence is the prerequisite for compensation of backwardness in the sector. "Pupils and students should be educated in such a way as to enable them to think scientifically, develop a scientific insight, understand scientific approaches and apply them while facing problems," he noted. He said that the talents of the youth and young adults should be identified and they should be supported and guided. "Just as applauding champions in athletic competitions promotes public sport, encouragement of the gifted pupils and students will contribute to development of science. "Giving the youth the momentum to be active in the field of science and technology will help safeguard them against social and ethical damage. "Establishment of research centers along with higher education institutes will give the youth a chance to get involved in extracurricular scientific activities. Development of schools and universities will be effective if the universities manage to train researchers," he added. The official said that having scientific exchanges with other countries and using the knowledge and experience of their scientific experts are required for sustained development in the field. Haddad-Adel pointed to the significance of establishment of an administrative system in line with promotion of science and technology as well as structural revision aiming to develop research and innovation. "The legislative body can help the government overcome the obstacles encountering them by approving effective laws," he concluded.
