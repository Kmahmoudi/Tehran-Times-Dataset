TEHRAN- The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) will re-open its representative office in Tehran by spring of 2017, IRNA quoted Indian Ambassador to Iran Shri Saurabh Kumar. During his Sunday meeting with Head of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) Gholam-Hossein Shafeie in Tehran, the ambassador informed that CII is taking the required final stages to re-launch its representative office in Tehran. Shafeie, for his part, referred to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Tehran on May 22-23, which was an important marker in New Delhi's attempt to instill momentum in bilateral ties, as well as the strategic ties between Iran and India, noting that the role of private sector should be improved in this regard. Both officials highlighted the significance of expanding bilateral ties via implementing the mutual contracts including Iran, India, Afghanistan trilateral transit pact (Known as Chabahar Treaty). The treaty allows the three countries to open new routes to connect among themselves via converting the Iranian southeastern port of Chabahar into a transit hub bypassing Pakistan. Accordingly, through Chabahar port India can bypass Pakistan and transport goods to Afghanistan and central Asia, while Afghanistan can get linked to India via sea. The document was signed in the presence of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
