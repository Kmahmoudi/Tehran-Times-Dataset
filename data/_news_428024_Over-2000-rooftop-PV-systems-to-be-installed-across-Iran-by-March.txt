TEHRAN – Iranian households are going to install 2000 new pooftop photovoltaic power stations (known as PV systems) across to country by the end of the next Iranian calendar year (March 2020), pushing the number of such small-scale power plants to reach 4000, IRIB reported on Sunday quoting an official. “We have already 2000 operational PV systems across the country and 2000 more are under installation”, Seyyed Mohammad Sadeqzadeh, head of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (known as SATBA), said. As the official noted, 150 to 200 megawatts will also be added to the country’s renewable power generation capacity through large-scale renewable plants by the mentioned date. According to Sadeqzadeh, 85 large-scale renewable power plants are currently operational across the country, 50 percent of which are solar plants. Renewables, including hydropower, account for just six percent of energy generation, versus natural gas’ 90 percent share. The country’s current capacity of generating electricity from renewable resources stands at 650 MW and with near 500 MW of new power plants under construction, the figure is expected to reach 1100 MW by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019). Overall, in the next five years, Iran is aiming for a 5,000 MW increase in renewable capacity to meet growing domestic demand and expand its presence in the regional electricity market.
