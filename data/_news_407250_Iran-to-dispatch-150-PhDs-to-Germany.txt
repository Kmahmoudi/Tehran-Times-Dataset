TEHRAN – Science Minister Mohammad Farhadi said on Sunday that Iran would dispatch a 150-member team of PhD students to Germany in the near future, urging expansion of scientific cooperation between the two sides, ISNA reported. “The move aims at implementation of agreements between the two countries as well as expansion of scientific cooperation,” Farhadi told a German academic panel visiting Iran. The academic panel, including 150 students, will study in Germany for a specified period in order to complete their doctorate, Farhadi said, calling the academic cooperation “beneficial” for Iranian universities.
