TEHRAN – Turkish Airlines has commenced advertising for several Iranian cities based on a previous agreement signed with Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, a deputy at the CHHTO said on Friday. “Promotion of Iran’s tourist attractions, their infrastructure as well as culture and history of its people and their famed hospitality can help attract more foreign tourists,” CHTN quoted Mohammad Moheb-Khodaei as saying. Based on the plans, people who visit Iran via Turkish Airlines will be offered with some bonuses, the official said without providing more details. For the time being, hotspots of Tabriz, Yazd, Ahvaz, Hamedan and Kerman appear on the airlines’ in-seat video screens as well as its publicity network, while yet to be started on its associated magazine, he added. In August 2017, the CHHTO announced that every single foreign tourist visiting Iran spends an average of $1,200, bringing in income as much as exporting 30 barrels of oil.
