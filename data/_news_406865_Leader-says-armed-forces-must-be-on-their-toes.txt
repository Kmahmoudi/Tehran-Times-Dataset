TEHRAN – Supreme Leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei called on the Iranian armed forces on Wednesday to remain on their toes both as the county is encountering “an immense front of enemies.” Ayatollah Khamenei made the comments at Shahid Sattari Air Force University while addressing the graduation ceremony of Army cadets.  “Today, the Iranian nation faces an immense front of enemies because of its insistence on Islam, sovereignty, its high values, and belief in the ruling of God, and the armed forces must always be ready to play their role should the need arise,” the Leader noted.  Ayatollah Khamenei described the capable, pious, and young forces of the country as a great source of wealth.  The Leader also pointed to the valor of the armed forces during the Iraqi invasion of Iran in the 1980s, saying, “The era of Sacred Defense was an ordeal, during which the true essence of the Iranian Army came to light and important and glorious achievements were made by the army forces.”  
Also the Leader reminded the significance of introducing the Sacred Defense era to young cadets in military colleges, noting, “The (Iraqi) eight-year imposed war (on Iran) was in fact an international war and an all-encompassing invasion by major powers and their global and regional followers on (Iran’s) borders, identity, values, the Islamic establishment, and the revolution of the Iranian nation.”     The ceremony came as a wrap-up of the Sacred Defense Week, an annual event to mark the 36th anniversary of the eight-year Iraqi war on Iran.   AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
