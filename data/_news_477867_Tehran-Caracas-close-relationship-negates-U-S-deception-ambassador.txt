TEHRAN - Hojjatollah Soltani, the Iranian ambassador to Caracas, said on Friday that the release of the final Iranian and Venezuelan crew of Emtrasur Cargo Airline is a sign of the success of Tehran-Caracas cooperation in resisting the false propaganda waged by the United States. Soltani asserted that “justice triumphed over injustice” as an official ceremony was held to embrace three Iranian and two Venezuelan aircraft crew. The 19 crew members of the Venezuelan Emtrasur Cargo Airline were detained on June 6 at the Buenos Aires Airport in Argentina due to baseless accusations made against Iran by the United States and its supporters. Ambassador Soltani noted that this was just one of thousands of lies that the U.S. and its allies have been spreading against Iran, Venezuela, and other independent states as a political tool and pressure leverage, but that reality will always come out.  It is not shrouded in secrecy to the general public that the U.S. is an expert lying hypocrite, the diplomat pointed out. Twelve crews were released by Argentina in the first stage; they landed in Venezuela on September 16 and two more were released on September 30. The final five crew have also just been released after an Argentine judge ruled that there is not enough evidence to bring charges against them. One of the Venezuelan crew members expressed delight at being back in their home country upon landing and thanked everyone who had worked to secure their release after 134 days in detention.
