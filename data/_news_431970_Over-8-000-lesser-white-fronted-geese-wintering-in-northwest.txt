The critically endangered species is now only found in one main population in East Asia, with a few birds remaining in the historic Western population, he said, adding that the Eastern population migrate from Siberia to China or Malaysia in winters, while the Western population, wing their ways to winter in Iran. He went on to say that with regard to the fact that the lesser white-fronted goose is the only small bird at risk of extinction, programs have been drawn up to strengthen their population, so they are protected whenever migrating.
