TEHRAN – A principlist parliamentarian, Hossein Naqavi Hosseini, on Tuesday warned the Foreign Ministry about European countries’ inaction regarding possible U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA. If the U.S. exits the nuclear deal, the European parties to the deal would take no measures to ensure that Iran could benefit from the JCPOA, Naqavi Hosseini predicted, Tasnim reported. Even now although the world’s major banks are not restricted to cooperate with Iranian banks, they show no willingness to do so due to U.S. threats, he said.
