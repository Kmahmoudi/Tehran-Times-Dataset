TEHRAN – The new ambassador of Mali to Iran, Mohammad Mayga, met with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian to submit a copy of his credentials at outset of his job in Tehran.  The Iranian foreign ministry said the meeting took place on Monday morning.  The Iranian foreign minister had a busy day on Monday taking part in the Tehran Dialogue Forum which was attended by a number of Iranian and foreign officials and diplomats. Amir Abdollahian met also met separately with Qatari Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad al-Khulaifi who was in Tehran to take part in the TDF gathering.  In their meeting, al-Khulaifi and Amir Abdollahian discussed “the latest about the sanctions removal talks,” according to the Iranian foreign ministry, a reference to talks in Vienna over reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Qatar has played a key role in relaying messages between Iran and the United States during the JCPOA talks. And the last round of talks was held in Doha before they come to a standstill due to a number of reasons.  Speaking at the TDF, Amir Abdollahian touched on the Vienna talks. ““On the one hand, the United States talks about the nuclear negotiations and [the need for] taking the final steps to achieve an agreement [on reviving the deal], while on the other hand, it supports insecurity and instability in Iran,” he said. “This hypocritical policy must end. If this is done and the United States takes realistic and practical steps to reach an agreement and return to its obligations as per the JCPOA, the Islamic Republic of Iran will also be ready to take the final steps toward an agreement for the removal of sanctions [imposed on the country] and return of all parties to their obligations.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
