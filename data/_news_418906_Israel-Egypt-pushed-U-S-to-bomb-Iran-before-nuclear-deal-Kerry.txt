Former American Secretary of State John Kerry has said both Israel and Egypt pushed the United States to “bomb Iran” before the 2015 nuclear deal was struck.
 Kerry defended the deal during a forum in Washington, where he said that a number of kings and foreign presidents told the U.S. that bombing was the only language to use in relation with Iran, AP reported. Kerry said that in his opinion it was “a trap” because the same countries would have publicly criticized the U.S. if it did carry out a bombing of Iran as they were secretly supporting. Kerry said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “genuinely agitating toward action” against Iran. SP/PA
