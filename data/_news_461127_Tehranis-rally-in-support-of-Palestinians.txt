Khaled al- Qaddumi, the representative of the Hamas movement in Tehran, condemned the hostile actions of the Zionist regime at the rally, saying, “Peace be upon the people of Iran, who are the cradle of resistance and endurance, and peace be upon the soul of Imam Khomeini, who made Quds the axis of resistance.” He stated that today there is more hope for victory than ever before. He added that today people are witnessing missiles that have illuminated the skies of the Zionist populated regions. Al-Qaddumi said, "We will not allow the Zionist regime to rest in peace."  He went on to say that today the Zionist regime is targeting Palestinian settlements with the most advanced military equipment, “but I am glad that the Palestinian people have destroyed the hegemony of Israel.” “The oppression of the enemy has reached its peak and the resistance has is determined to destroy Israel and the Zionist regime.
