 “The two countries have close, cultivated relations in all fields and medicine is one of them,” Hassan Qazizadeh-Hashemi said subsequent to his visit with Azerbaijani Minister of Economic Development Shahin Mustafayev.  “The meetings with Azerbaijani officials were very much constructive and issues such as insurance coverage and exchange of experience were discussed,” the Iranian minister added. He went on to say that holding such meetings [for improved cooperation] between the neighboring countries can produce desirable outcomes.
