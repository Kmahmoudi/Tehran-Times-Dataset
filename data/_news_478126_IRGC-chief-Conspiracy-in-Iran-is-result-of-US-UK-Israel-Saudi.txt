TEHRAN — Speaking at a funeral ceremony for the martyrs of the Shiraz terrorist attack on Saturday, IRGC chief Major General Hossein Salami blamed the U.S., Britain, Saudi Arabia and Israel for the unrest in Iran. He also warned Saudi Arabia for funding media who inflame the feelings of the Iranian youth, saying, “You cannot create anxiety for the Iranian nation and yourself live in calm.” The London-based Iran International, which has been playing a major role in provoking unrest in Iran, is funded by Saudi Arabia. The disinformation campaign by the network is also led by Israel. The commander also warned Washington which has openly expressed support for the rioters in Iran. “We will bury U.S. pipedreams in this land. We also warn Saudi rulers to think about the repercussions of their actions.”  “You cannot create anxiety for the Iranian nation and you yourself live in calm,” the IRGC chief warns the Saudi kingdom.Those behind unrest in Iran cannot tolerate the Islamic Republic’s political and spiritual influence across the region, and have therefore resorted to inflaming violence in the country, but to no avail, Salami asserted. “The current conspiracy (unrest) in our country is the result of the joint policies of the United States, Britain, Saudi Arabia and the Zionist regime, which have suffered severe back-to-back defeats from the Iranian nation during the last 43 years,” General Salami pointed out.  General Salami also praised the spirit of the Iranian nation and their resistance against the coercive sanctions of the United States. The top general went on to state that the sanctions made the Iranian nation stronger.  “When America sanctioned you, you passed it with power and destroyed their drone to prove that America cannot do a damn thing, and when the hero of the fight against terrorism, Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, was brutally martyred, you targeted the American base (Ain-al-Assad), which is a symbol of American power in Iraq and proved again that America cannot do a damn thing!” Salami highlighted.  Addressing the mourners in Shiraz, the IRGC chief also said “The Islamic establishment is deeply-rooted in the hearts and minds of the Iranian nation.”  He then advised the few remaining protestors in the streets, calling on them not to sell their honor to American officials. “We say this to the few deceived youths of Iran, do you know what America's wish is for Iran and its youth? They said that we should Americanize the Iranian youth so that they can hear our voice, and America's dream for our youth is that the Iranian youth will only be killed and it doesn't matter who that youth is,” the senior commander pointed out. According to Press TV, Salami added, “My advice to rioting students is: ‘Return to the nation, don’t play into the hands of enemies.”  He also said those who show disrespect for women wearing hijab are following the foes’ dictates. “Those flouting hijab and harassing veiled women are following the path of enemies. This ominous plot of riots in Iran has been constructed in U.S. command rooms. He went on to say that the United States’ image of Iran is closure of all centers, turmoil and insecurity, attack on security forces, and burning of public and private properties.  “America's wish about Iran is a needy and dependent country, and they are waiting for the country to return to a time when oil is ready to be looted and 40 thousand American advisors decide its fate. They want to take our religion, and we tell them we will take your world from you,” the IRGC commander-in-chief concluded.  ************H    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
