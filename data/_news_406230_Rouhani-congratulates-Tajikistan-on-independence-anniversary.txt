TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sent a message to President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan on Friday and congratulated the Tajik people and government on the 25th anniversary of the country’s independence.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran has stood beside the Tajik people since the time Tajikistan gained independence and has always made efforts to expand bilateral cooperation in line with common interests of the two countries by establishing deep and friendly relations,” he said. Rouhani added that the two countries will expand cooperation in various areas given the cultural affinities between the two nations.  Tajikistan declared independence from the Soviet Union on September 9, 1991, as a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union. According to Wikipedia, a civil war was fought almost immediately after independence, lasting from 1992 to 1997. Since the end of the war, newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country’s economy to grow. NA/AK
