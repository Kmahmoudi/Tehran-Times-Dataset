TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Sunday that those behind the Ahvaz terrorist attack will face “deadly and unforgettable revenge in the near future.” In a statement issued a day after the attack, which targeted a military parade on Sunday, the IRGC said the enemies, especially the Western-Hebrew-Arabic triangle of evil, spare no efforts in disrupting Iran’s security. “They are even ready to make women, children and innocent people the target of their blind terrorist acts,” the IRGC said, vowing to track down “regionally and beyond,” those behind the assault.
