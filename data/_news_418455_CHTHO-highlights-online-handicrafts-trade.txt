TEHRAN – The Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization urges exporters and handicrafts retailers to take the best use of online marketing. “A synergy between the arenas of handicrafts, mass media and software programs can lead us to boundless online businesses with the globe,” said Pouya Mahmoudian who presides over the CHTHO exports department. She made the remarks in an address to a conference on global online handicrafts retailing market, which was held at the CHTHO headquarters in Tehran on Sunday. “Be online and sell globally” was adopted as the theme for the event. “By digging into electronic commerce we would become closer to world markets, as India and China have taken the initiative before, which resulted in exerting more influence over such marketplaces,” she highlighted. Mahmoudian added: “To claim the country’s share of retail trade, the handicrafts organization has entered into a contract with Zoodel, an Iranian international post company.” The CHTHO warmly welcomes any other companies and the private sector to join hand in this regard, she added.   In an interview with the Tehran Times, CHTHO Deputy Director Bahman Namvar-Motlaq urged media to assume an extended role in promoting the “proper usage” of national handicrafts. Handicrafts exports from Iran hit a record high over the first four months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21-July 22, 2017) with 45.4 percent growth in comparison to the same period last year, the organization announced in September.
