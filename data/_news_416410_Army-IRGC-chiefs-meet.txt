TEHRAN – The commanders of Army and the IRGC met on Wednesday morning to voice unity and determination for enhancing national defensive capabilities, Mehr news agency reported. Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the IRGC commander, visited the headquarters of the Army to congratulate Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi who was promoted to the rank of Army chief in recent days. Reportedly, commanders from the Army and IRGC were also present at the meeting. During their meeting, the two general voiced satisfaction with the current situation of the armed forces. They underlined that the exemplary unity among the armed forces has infuriated the enemies of the Iranian nation. Such sense of unity, the commanders said, will foil the enemies’ plots intending to divide the armed forces and undermine defensive capabilities. Last week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appointed Mousavi as commander of the Army after promoting him to the rank of major general. Abdolrahim Mousavi, 57, served as armed forces deputy chief of staff from 2016 to 2017. He was second-in-command of the Army from 2008 to 2016. MH/PA
