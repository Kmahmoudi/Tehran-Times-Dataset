The lavishly decorated structure is a subset of a vast complex named after a regional governor who ordered its construction in the early 17th century during the Safavid era.   Covering an area of 11,000 square meters, the complex also comprises a madrasa, a mosque, a caravanserai, a water reservoir and a labyrinth bazaar all centered on a large public square.
