TEHRAN – Iran’s exports from mining sector have risen by 48 percent year-on-year during the first quarter of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-June 20), ISNA reported on Saturday. According to IRNA, Deputy Industry, Mines and Trade Minister in Mines and Mining Industries Jafar Sarghini said that during the mentioned period Iran has exported $2 billion worth of mineral products to other countries.  “For the time being, there are 7,500 mines across the country from which 2,000 ones are non-operational or under preparation processes,” he said.  Mentioning the recent recession in the mine and mining sector, Sarghini noted that “low prices” for minerals around the world is one of the main factors causing the crisis. The official also stressed that the rise of exports in this sphere occurred despite the continuous drop in mineral products’ prices around the world and also given that there has not been any considerable increases in global production. Back in June, Ministry of Industry, Mines and Trade announced that mineral products and industries accounted for 16.5 percent of the country’s non-oil exports during the past Iranian calendar year (ended on March 19). The value of exports from the country’s mining sector exceeded $7 billion in the past year.
