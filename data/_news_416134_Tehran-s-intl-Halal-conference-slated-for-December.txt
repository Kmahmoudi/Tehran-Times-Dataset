TEHRAN – Iran will debut its first International conference on Halal food and business in Tehran during December 4 to 7, IRIB news reported on Sunday. “Halal Orientation, The New Global Trend” has been adopted as a motto for the event, which is organized by Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture in close collaboration with the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization and the private sector. “During the past couple of years, various countries have put the promotion of Halal [business] atop agenda by holding conferences not only in national or regional scale but also in international arena,” IRIB quoted ICCIMA Deputy Director Mohammadreza Karbasian as saying. The conference is expected to raise the country’s share of the global Halal market, he added. Back in June, the Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran (ISIRI) announced plans to establish a set of standards to promote Halal tourism in the country. The Arabic word Halal refers to what is permissible or lawful in traditional Islamic law; frequently applied to permissible food and drinks. A subcategory of traveling, Halal tourism is geared toward the specific needs of Muslim individuals who seek to abide by the Islamic rules.
