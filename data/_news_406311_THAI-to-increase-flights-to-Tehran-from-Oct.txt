Thai Airways International (THAI) announced that it will increase the number of its flights on the Bangkok-Tehran route to four a week from October 1, Bangkok Post reported on Monday. Many international airlines have launched or resumed direct flights to Iran after the country’s nuclear deal with the world’s major powers which lifted the sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
British Airways has resumed direct flights to Iran after a hiatus of four years and Air France resumed Paris-Tehran flights in April for the first time in eight years. 
Austrian Airlines has been offering its passengers an additional daily flight to Tehran since March 2016, and flies to the Iranian capital up to twice each day. MA/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
