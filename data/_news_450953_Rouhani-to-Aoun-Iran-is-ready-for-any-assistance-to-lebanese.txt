TEHRAN– Iranian President Hassan Rouhani held phone talks with the Lebanese President Michel Aoun on Thursday, voicing Iran's readiness for any humanitarian cooperation and assistance with Lebanon. Expressing sympathy with Lebanese government and nation, Rouhani said, "Iranian government and nation, as always, will stand by the dear people of Lebanon, and the Iranian government is ready to send any medical and food consignments." "Iran's foreign and health ministers, as well as the head of the Red Crescent, have been tasked with keeping in touch with their counterparts so that we can provide any assistance to Lebanon's people quickly," he added. He went on to wish a speedy recovery for those injured. Praising the Iranian government and people's sympathy over the Beirut explosion, Michel Aoun, for his part, said, "The Lebanese people have always appreciated the attention and love of the Iranian people and government."
