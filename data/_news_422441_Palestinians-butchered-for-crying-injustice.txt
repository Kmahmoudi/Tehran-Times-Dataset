For a second consecutive Friday, on March 30 and April 6, Israeli forces used live ammunition, killing 31 and injuring about 3000 peaceful Palestinian demonstrators in Gaza. The Palestinians were brutally suppressed as they were protesting along the eastern borders of the Gaza Strip, as part of the Great March of Return movement. Israel has become so arrogant that it even does not tolerate peaceful rallies by Palestinians against their displacement and occupation of their lands. Shockingly, it even praises snipers who target marchers. And also since the world has rightly become highly sensitive against acts of terror, the Tel Aviv regime is misusing the situation to brand Palestinians’ protest against injustice, displacement and occupation by burning tires as acts of terror. However, if the Palestinians’ return march movement is equal to terrorism, why does the United States, as Israel’s biggest protector, block an “independent and transparent investigation” into the killings of Palestinians by the UN Security Council? Israel is trying to say that Hamas is the organizer of the march but, according to the Washington Post, the demonstrations have drawn Palestinians from various factions. "The march is organized by refugees, doctors, lawyers, university students, Palestinian intellectuals, academics, civil society organizations and Palestinian families," Asad Abu Sharekh, the spokesperson of the march, told Al Jazeera. The planned protests, which started on Land Day, is expected to continue until the Nakba anniversary on May 15, which marks 70 years since 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their villages and towns in 1948. According to the statistics, about 70 percent of Gaza’s two million residents are refugees or the descendants of those displaced from towns and villages now in Israel. These refugees are seeking the right to return to their ancestral land. However, who cares about the sufferings and the old wounds of the Palestinians, especially those in besieged Gaza?   The Tel Aviv regime, which its 70 years of life is filled with crimes against Palestinians and violation of international law, is feeling more emboldened to do injustice against Palestinians now that Trump is at the White House, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince is wagging the tail at Israel, and the Arab world is fractured.
