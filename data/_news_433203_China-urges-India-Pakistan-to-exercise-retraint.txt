TEHRAN - China, a regional giant, has urged two estranged neighbors Pakistan and India to exercise restraint and conduct dialogue to achieve resolution of outstanding issues. The statement comes in the wake of deadly terror attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that has again derailed relations between the two countries, bringing them on the brink of war. “Pakistan and India are both important countries in South Asia. The stability of bilateral relations is crucial to regional peace, stability and development,” Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesperson Geng Shuang said the current situation in South Asia was generally stable and this situation was hard-won and deserved to be cherished and maintained by all parties concerned. He hoped that both India and Pakistan would exercise restraint and conduct dialogue to achieve a soft lining of relevant issues as soon as possible. The spokesperson said that the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a pilot project under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and it was committed to consultation and collaboration for shared benefits. He further said it has always adhered to the principles of mutual cooperation, co-construction, sharing and openness, and transparency. “Last year, when State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Pakistan, China and Pakistan agreed to welcome third parties to participate in the construction of the corridor, so that the corridor not only benefits the people of China and Pakistan but also promotes regional economic cooperation and interconnection and achieves common development”, he added.
