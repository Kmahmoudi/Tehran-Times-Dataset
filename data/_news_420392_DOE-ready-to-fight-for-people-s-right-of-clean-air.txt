TEHRAN – Implementation of clean air law will definitely face serious oppositions but the Department of Environment is ready to stand up for the nation’s right to have clean air, DOE chief Isa Kalantari said on Tuesday.  The clean air law was passed by Majlis [the Iranian parliament] in July 2017 and related guidelines for its implementation are under development. He regarded domestic car manufacturers as one of the groups which will oppose this law and urged all environment managers to be totally ready for a fierce battle.“If its guidelines are approved till the end of current [Iranian calendar] year (ending on March 20), we will surely implement the law,” IRNA quoted Kalantari, as saying. “The right for clean air precedes the nuclear right,” he highlighted.  He regarded domestic car manufacturers as one of the groups which will oppose this law and urged all environment managers to be totally ready for a fierce battle. Criticizing the excessive support for domestic production which may even cost the lives of people, Kalantari said that top officials prevent the closure of some polluting industries with excuses such as creating unemployment. According to Health Ministry, air pollution claims 29,000 lives annually nationwide, he regretted, adding, “I hope that clean air law can help but without a national determination for the environment, these laws may not be effective.” MAH/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
