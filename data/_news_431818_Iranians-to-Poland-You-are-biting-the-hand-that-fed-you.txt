TEHRAN – The Polish government’s plan to hold an anti-Iran conference has been widely criticized by Iranian authorities, who described it as a “hostile act against Iran”. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Friday that Poland and the United States are jointly organizing the global conference in Warsaw on February 13-14, with the aim of curbing Iran's influence in the region. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, spokesman of the Guardian Council, said in a tweet on Sunday that the Polish government’s decision to host the conference is aimed to create a NATO military base, called “Trump’s fortress”. He also pointed to an arms procurement deal, which Poland signed last year with the U.S. to buy Raytheon Co’s (RTN.N) Patriot missile defense system for $4.75 billion, saying the move foreshadowed closer relations between the two countries. Others reminded Poland that Iran had saved the Poles in WWII, saying the Polish government’s move is like “biting the hand that feeds you”. According to IRNA, the history of Iran-Poland diplomatic relations date back to the Safavid dynasty. In an article, IRNA added the oldest diplomatic correspondence between the two countries date back to 1474, meaning Poland was one of the first countries with which Iran has had diplomatic relations.
