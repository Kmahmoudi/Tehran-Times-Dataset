TEHRAN – Tehran’s ambassador to Paris said on Tuesday that Iran’s defense capability has nothing to do with the 2015 nuclear agreement Tehran signed with six world powers and the European Union, Tasnim reported. “If Europe or others have concerns or questions about the Islamic Republic of Iran’s foreign policy regarding the Middle East or its defense capabilities, these are two separate things and have nothing to do with the JCPOA,” Abolqasem Delfi said. He also said the nuclear deal is a multilateral agreement endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution and cannot be changed.
