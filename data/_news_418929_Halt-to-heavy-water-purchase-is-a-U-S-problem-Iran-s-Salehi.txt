TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said on Friday that it is the Trump administration’s problem for halting purchase of heavy water from Iran.
 Washington Free Beacon reported on Thursday that The Trump administration has put a stop to U.S. purchases of nuclear materials from Iran, a policy that first began under the Obama administration. “No, the United States is not planning to purchase any Iranian heavy water,” a White House National Security Council spokesperson told the Free Beacon. In July 2016, both Tehran and Washington confirmed the completion of the heavy-water deal, under which Iran had sold 32 tons of heavy water for a price of $8.6 million. Under the JCPOA deal signed by Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council in July 2015, Tehran agreed to export all its excess heavy water to the international market.
