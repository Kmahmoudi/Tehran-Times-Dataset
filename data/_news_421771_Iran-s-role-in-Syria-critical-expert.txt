TEHRAN – Jim W. Dean, managing editor of the “Veterans Today”, has hailed Iran’s role in fighting the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group. “Iran and Hezbollah support in Syria’s anti-terrorism campaign was critical in not only backing up the badly battered Syrian army but boosting its fighting capability when much of the officer corps had defected, bought off really by the Saudis,” Dean said in an interview with IRNA published on Sunday. “The Iranians played a key role in helping to organize the various Syrian anti-terrorist groups,” he said, adding that Iran’s anti-terrorism partners helped the Syrian Army build its pride back up after so many defeats.
