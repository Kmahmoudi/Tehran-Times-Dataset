On Saturday a bunch of zealots got together in Paris to mark the annual meeting of the Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO), also referred to as Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) in foreign media outlets.   Participants at the gathering were a number of American hawks such as Rudy Giuliani - Donald Trump’s personal lawyer and former New York mayor- a number of other former U.S. officials, former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and a number of MKO members.  According to the Guardian, groups of bored-looking Poles, Czechs, Slovakians, Germans and Syrians also attended the event. The Guardian said they responded to a Facebook campaign promising travel, food and accommodation to Paris for a mere €25.  Anybody who is little bit familiar with the record of the MKO and the personality of its ringleaders including Maryam Rajavi cannot stop laughing when he notices that Giuliani told the gathering that the ruling system in Iran “must be replaced by a democratic government which Madam Rajavi represents”.  The MKO, a totalitarian cult group, is detested by all Iranians with different political persuasions. The people can never forget that they sided with Iraq’s Saddam Hussein during his war against Iran in the 1980s. The Iraqis also hate this group as Saddam Hussein used them to suppress opponents, especially the Kurds in northern Iraq. In addition to terrorist activities in the days of the 1979 revolution which the number of their victims reach about 17000, the MKO still commits acts of terror whenever it finds an opportunity. The assassination of Iranian nuclear experts on orders of the Israeli spy agency Mossad is an example. Those MKO members who had succeeded to flee from Camp Ashraf in Iraq have cited horrific stories about the group. One may not expect persons like Maryam Rajavi and other MKO ringleaders to repent their past and apologize the Iranians because they have brainwashed and ruined the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iranian youth through their extreme political and religious dispositions. However, it is shocking to see that some figures like Giuliani and Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a close Trump ally, attend MKO conferences. It is noteworthy that John Bolton, who now acts as national security advisor to Trump, also attended the group’s meeting last year.  When one sees such moves he asks himself: How can these figures, no matter how much hawkish they may be, attend the meetings of the MKO which its history is rife with terrorism and treason?  No matter how much Giuliani, Bolton, Gingrich, Harper and other hawks hate the Islamic republic system but attending the gatherings of such an extreme group is disgraceful and self-inflicting otherwise we conclude that these persons are as stupid, bigoted, dangerous, and extreme as the MKO ringleaders.       All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
