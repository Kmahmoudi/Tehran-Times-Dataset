TEHRAN – A three-story museum complex dedicated to traditional bazaar (marketplace) of Tabriz and its associated occupations has opened its doors to the public in the northwestern Iranian city.  During an inauguration ceremony on May 11, Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization Director Zahra Ahmadipour cut the ribbon on the museum, which brings together a wide variety of crafts, arts, and history of the ancient city.  Tabriz has been a melting pot of cultural exchange since antiquity and once a hot spot on the ancient Silk Road. It is home to a UNESCO-registered bazaar that embraces countless shops as well as several caravanserais, inns, domed halls, bathhouses, and mosques.
