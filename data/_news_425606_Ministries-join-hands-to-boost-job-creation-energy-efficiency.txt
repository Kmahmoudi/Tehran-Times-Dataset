Humans are consuming more energy every year, and utility companies are scrambling to meet the demand. According to Business Insider, the International Energy Agency expects global energy demand to increase by 37% by 2040, which would likely put a strain on energy supplies. But utility companies are finding solutions thanks to the Internet of Things. The IoT is making energy use more efficient, which should help relieve some of the stress on energy demand. Smart meters have become the top IoT device among utility companies in the last several years. These devices attach to buildings and connect to a smart energy grid, which allows these companies to more effectively manage energy flow into buildings. But there are many more ways the IoT will help the energy industry, specifically water, electric, oil, and gas utilities. Below, we've outlined the ways that IoT utility companies are making energy consumption more efficient.
