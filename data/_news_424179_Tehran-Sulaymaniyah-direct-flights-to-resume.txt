TEHRAN - Iran will soon resume direct flights from Tehran to Sulaymaniyah, a city in Iraq’s Kurdistan, after almost eight months halt. Mahan Air, a Tehran-based private airline, is scheduled to switch the service on June 10, ISNA reported on Friday. Back in April, Iran also reestablished flights from Tehran to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Many foreign airlines suspended flights to Erbil and Sulaymaniyah in September 2017 after the Baghdad government imposed an air ban on the region in retaliation for an independence vote.
