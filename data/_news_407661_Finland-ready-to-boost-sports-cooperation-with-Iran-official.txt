Finnish Ambassador to Tehran Harri Kämäräinen believes his country has a lot to share with Iran in areas such as nutritional research and sports teacher training courses. Kämäräinen tough his small country is not at the same level as Iran is in connection with athletic performance.
“We have some features when it comes to the sports and training sportsmen. We can offer interesting training camps, for example, in the field of nutritional research for sportsmen. Finland is rather advanced in this area,” he said.  
“Also, one more area for cooperation is the training of teachers, particularly when it comes to sports teachers. We could share our experience in this area, as well,” Kämäräinen added. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
