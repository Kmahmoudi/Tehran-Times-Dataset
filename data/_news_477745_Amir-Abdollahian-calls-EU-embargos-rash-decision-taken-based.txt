TEHRAN- The sanctions imposed on Iran by the European Union have drawn criticism from Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who called them "superfluous" and "an unconstructive move out of miscalculation." “Down a well-worn path of ineffective sanctions, the EU today adopted further superfluous sanctions on Iranian persons. It is an unconstructive act out of miscalculation, based on widespread disinformation,” Amir Abdollahian said on his Twitter account on Monday.    He highlighted that Iran is not an exception to the rule that "riots and vandalism are not allowed anywhere." His tweet came after the EU imposed sanctions on 11 Iranian individuals and four entities over the country's response to the riots that followed the death of a young woman in police custody. The Basij forces, a section of the Iranian police, and the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps' cyber unit were among those sanctioned. Issa Zarepour, Iran's Minister of Communications and Information Technology, was also named on the EU’s list of people responsible for the alleged internet blackout. Travel restrictions and asset freezes are examples of coercive tactics. The death of Mahsa Amini sparked demonstrations initially in her home province of Kurdistan and then in a number of other locations, including the capital Tehran. Amini fainted in a police station on September 13. Three days later a hospital in Tehran declared her dead. However, some violent extremists disrupted the demonstrations and incited violence against law enforcement forces. Media organizations supported by the West have also promoted violence. Rumors that she died because of a blow to her head prove wrong. After the Forensic Medicine confirmed on October 7 that Amini’s death did not happen because of a trauma, an investigation by a parliamentary committee released on Sunday also confirmed the finding. The report verified that the young woman was not hit while in the police custody. Nasser Kanaani, the spokesperson for Iran's Foreign Ministry, earlier on Monday warned European nations against interfering in Iran's internal affairs and asked them to avoid from doing so. Tehran would take "a reciprocal and proportional measure" in the event that its domestic affairs were meddled with, he warned.
