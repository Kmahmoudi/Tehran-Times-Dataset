TEHRAN- Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, on Monday warned the three European parties to the 2015 nuclear deal that a resolution against Iran by the IAEA Board of Governors would disrupt the current conditions, according to Tasnim news agency.  Speaking to reporters after a meeting with members of the Parliament National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, Zarif warned of agitation in case the International Atomic Energy Agency’s board issues a statement against Iran over its decision to suspend the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol of the NPT. “The Europeans (the UK, France, and Germany) have begun a wrong move at the Board of Governors with backing of the United States. We believe such an action would upset the conditions,” Zarif noted. He also stressed that Iran’s ambassador to the Vienna-based international organizations has already warned the Board of Governors about the consequences of confusing the status quo.   “We hope wisdom would prevail, otherwise, we would have (other) approaches,” Zarif warned. Speaking at the parliamentary meeting, Zarif also said the U.S. has no right to return to the JCPOA – the official name for the 2105 nuclear deal- until it recommits itself to its obligations. In accordance with the Iranian Parliament’s legislation on lifting sanctions, Iran has halted the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol because the signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal have failed to fulfill their commitments. Following last week’s visit to Tehran by the IAEA director-general, Tehran and the UN nuclear watchdog issued a joint statement, declaring that Iran will stop its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol and will deny IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear facilities beyond the Safeguards Agreement as of February 23, 2021, for three months.
