There is finger-pointing to external interventions in the latest unrest in Iran. Attempts were made to tamper with security and stability inside the country by relying on some of the tools used by intelligence agencies. There is no difference between two groups in Iran: one affected by the government's economic policies, and the other who is ready to take to the streets to put pressure on the government and demand for their rights. But this situation was seen by the enemy as a golden opportunity to ride on the wave and move the spies at ‘home’ to distort the demonstrations and spread chaos and criminality, and more importantly interfere with Iran's national security in any way. Two years ago, Iran discovered the involvement of foreign intelligence services particularly the Israeli Mossad in its domestic affairs. An example is given below: 
An Iranian named Amir, who was living in the Kurdistan region of Iraq was a spy of Mossad. The Iranian intelligence agency, aware of the fact, kept silent on the matter and replaced Amir with someone else to continue to communicate with his Israeli operator. Mossad did not realize that his ‘agent’ had been changed and that they had been communicating with a new person appointed by the Iranian intelligence agency. The game continued on for two years. The exposed person was Amir. And an intermediary between him and Mossad was a Turkish newspaper, discovered by the Turkish intelligence service about 3 months ago. The leakage led to the shutdown of the publication. The Turkish newspaper admitted that Mossad was planning disturbances in Iran and gave out evidence on it. This confirms that the actions of some young people, who initiated the riots on the streets of Tehran and other attacks on public and private properties elsewhere, were instigated by Mossad and other foreign intelligence services who tried to get inside Iran to activate sedition and chaos. But Iranian counter intelligence forces identified and arrested them and recorded their confessions. An official Iranian newspaper revealed the other week that American, Israeli and Saudi officers formed a control room in the city of Erbil in the Iraqi Kurdistan to manage the demonstrations in Iran a few days prior to the mayhem. The incident confirms the foreign countries were running the show. “Information leaked that the desperate and defeated America formed two control rooms to run these demonstrations in the Afghan city of Herat and Erbil, where U.S., Israeli and Saudi officers and representatives of the terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq organization were involved,” Kayhan newspaper wrote in an editorial. This is additional evidence of the involvement of America and Mossad in the riots that were intended to create disturbances in Iran and bring down the country as a key player in the region.  The newspaper added, “The limited demonstrations, just bubbles, will soon come to an end, because from early the unrest attracted no supporters, as they were intended for chaos and vandalism.”  Blowing the limited protests “out of proportion” immersed in a trance and Washington and its two allies - Zionist entity and Saudi Arabia – “confirmed the extent of their failure in the face of Iran as well as their inability to understand the Iranian reality and their dedication to the Islamic Republic, eternal revolution and its sacred goals,” the publication stated. “Iranians will never give up the principles,” the newspaper added.  All these and other signs have already been reported by the Israeli channel 10 TV, revealing a closed door meeting between Mir Ben-Sabr, the Israeli national security advisor in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, and his American counterpart Herbert on December 12, during which they reached a “deal” that calls for the development of operational scenarios and plans to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and developing ballistic missiles. The deal also prevents Iran from strengthening position in the region and from being an actor in countries like Syria and Lebanon. The accord also offers a strategy to counter the threats of Hezbollah in Lebanon. The agreement was confirmed in the official statement of the White House, though it didn’t have any media leakage.
