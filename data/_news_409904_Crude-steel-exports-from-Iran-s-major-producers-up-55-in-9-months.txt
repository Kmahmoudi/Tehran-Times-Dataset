TEHRAN- Iran’s eight major steel producers exported 4.12 million tons of crude steel in the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-Decemebr 20, 2016), with 55 percent rise from the same period of time in the previous year, IRNA reported on Sunday. The eight producers’ crude steel exports also witnessed 117 percent rise in the ninth calendar month of Azar (November 20-Decemebr 20, 2016), from the same month of the past year, to stand at 479,854 tons. Iran’s annual crude steel production and exports are planned to hit 15 million tons and 6 million tons, respectively, by the end of current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017). The country’s annual crude steel output is planned to reach 55 million tons according to its outlook plan for 2025. As a major steel producer in the region, Iran boosted its steel mills across the country in recent years, as central Isfahan and southwestern Khuzestan provinces remain the major steel producers. According to World Steel Association (WSA), Iran was the biggest producer of crude steel in the Middle East in 2013. The country’s rank was 14th in the world in 2014.
