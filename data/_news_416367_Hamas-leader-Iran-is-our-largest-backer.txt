TEHRAN – The new Gaza leader of the Palestinian resistance group Hamas said on Monday Iran is now “the largest backer financially and militarily” of the group. Yahya Sinwar, in his first meeting with journalists since taking up his post in February, told reporters that the resistance group has restored ties with Iran and is preparing for future wars with Israel. Sinwar said with the help Hamas receives from Iran, it is accumulating military power in preparation for a battle for “the liberation of Palestine.” MH/PA
