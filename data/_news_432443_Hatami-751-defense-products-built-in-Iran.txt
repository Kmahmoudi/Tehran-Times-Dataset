TEHRAN – Defense Minister Amir Hatami on Tuesday appreciated the efforts made by Iran’s scientists, saying thanks to their efforts “we have 751 different defense products being produced.” He said prior to the Islamic Revolution, Iran was able to produce only 31 defense products, which was done with total dependence on other countries, ISNA reported. The minister also pointed to U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, saying the sanctions aimed to create divisions between the people and the system. The enemies were unaware of the fact that the insightful Iranian nation would never fall into their trap, the general added.
