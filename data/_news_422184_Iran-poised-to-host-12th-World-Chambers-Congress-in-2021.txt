From dedicated participation in previous congresses to leadership roles within WCF, these chambers each have shown their unwavering support of the global chamber movement and its ever-growing network. Commenting on the bidding process, WCF Chair Peter Mihok said: “We congratulate the four competing chambers for making it this far and are excited to see what each of them plan to highlight in their upcoming presentations.” The selected candidates are set to submit a first draft of their bid on 9 March.
