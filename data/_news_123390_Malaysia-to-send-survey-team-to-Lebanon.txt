He said the team comprising six officers, would leave for Lebanon soon and among the tasks were to identify the requirements including logistics and the support of the people there. Speaking to reporters after opening the Alor Star Umno delegates conference here, he said Indonesia and Brunei would join Malaysia in the effort. He said ties between Malaysia and Lebanon were good but the decision to deploy peacekeepers there depended on the approval of the United Nations (UN). "We have not received the UN's confirmation. Still waiting. Hopefully the UN approves," he said and admitted that Lebanon always welcomed the presence of Malaysian peacekeepers. He said that based on the excellent service record of Malaysian peacekeepers, the UN could certainly consider the country's participation in Lebanon. If the UN did not approve, Malaysia would find another way to assist Lebanon, he said. Israel has objected to Malaysia's participation in the peacekeeping force.
