The CBI's Public Relations Department, in a statement issued today, blasted the U.S. Department of Treasury's decision preventing financial dealings with Iran's state-owned Bank Saderat, and issued necessary instructions to banks all over the country to defy the decision. "Such moves with psychological effects have been witnessed in the past, but the CBI and other Iranian banks will continue their activities and banking affairs (as usual)," the statement added. The CBI on Monday took the announced decision of the U.S. Treasury's Department's undersecretary against Bank Saderat in stride, saying it was aimed at creating psychological fear by blocking Iran from using the global banking and financial system. Some economic and political experts believe the current positive trend in nuclear negotiations between Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Ali Larijani and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana is the reason for the decision taken by the U.S. Department of Treasury. As reported in the foreign media, the US Department of Treasury "has barred U.S. banks from dealing with Bank Saderat Iran." Bank Saderat Iran countered on Sunday by announcing that "all financial transactions of the bank, both in its domestic and overseas branches, are fully conducted in accordance with the Islamic system and international rules and regulations."
