TEHRAN – On Friday, Iranian naval forces started a three-day drill in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman.
 The large-scale drill is being held in an area of two million square kilometers, from the Strait of Hormuz to the southeastern coasts of Makran, the Sea of Oman and the northern parts of the Indian Ocean, down to the 10-degrees latitude. A new domestically made submarine dubbed “Fateh (Conqueror)” and the Sahand destroyer are also participating in the war game. Navy Commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi said on Thursday that the military exercise is composed of four separate phases, including naval parades, simulation of a real naval war, maritime and land offense to practice recapturing the territories occupied by the enemy, and the display of the Navy’s power by launching various types of missiles and torpedoes. He said the submarines will also launch missiles in the exercise, noting that anti-submarine helicopters will also land on and take off from the Sahand destroyer’s deck. Electronic warfare tactics and electronic data transmission from the coast are among other parts of the exercise, he said according to Press TV.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
