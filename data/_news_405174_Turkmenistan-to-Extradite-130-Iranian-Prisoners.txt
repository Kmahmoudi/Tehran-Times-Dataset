TEHRAN– 130 Iranian inmates will be extradited from Turkmenistan in the near future. The necessary legal and consular arrangements are underway to extradite the Iranian prisoners, who are expected to enter Iran from the Bajgiran border crossing. Iranian officials estimate the number of the country’s nationals put in jail in Turkmenistan at around 400. Back in July, Iran’s ambassador to Ashgabat Mohammad Ahmadi said more than 300 Iranian prisoners will be extradited from Turkmenistan to serve the remainder of their sentences at home. The ambassador noted that an extradition treaty between Iran and Turkmenistan does not apply to political convicts. In March 2015, Iran and Turkmenistan held a high-ranking joint session in Ashgabat, and signed 17 cooperation documents in economic, cultural, political, legal, scientific, and technological fields. The extradition treaty was one of the documents signed in the joint session, attended by Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani and his Turkmen counterpart Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow.
