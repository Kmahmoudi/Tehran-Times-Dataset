TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says for the 2015 nuclear accord to stay alive, the remaining signatories need to guarantee that Iran will be “unconditionally” compensated with the return of American sanctions. In a letter published on his Twitter account, Zarif called for action in the face of Washington’s “ever-expanding economic bullying,” which poses a threat to “not just the accord, but multilateralism and the rule of law.” “If JCPOA is to survive, the remaining JCPOA Participants and other economic partners need to ensure that Iran is compensated unconditionally through appropriate national, regional and global measures,” he wrote.
