TEHRAN – Addressing the UN Security Council on Thursday, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he is in “permanent contact” with all partis to the Vienna talks to resurrect the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 “I am in permanent contact with all the parties to try to arrange a return to the JCPOA and ensure its full implementation,” the EU’s chief diplomat pointed out. Borrell added, “The basic elements and terms to do this are known and on the table. And the time for decision is now.” Borrell made the remarks at the beginning of his speech, saying “we are at a historical juncture” in which the “multilateral system is under pressure like never before”.
