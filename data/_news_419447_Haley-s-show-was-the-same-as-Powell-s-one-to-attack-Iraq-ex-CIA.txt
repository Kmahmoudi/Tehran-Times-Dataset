TEHRAN - Robert David Steele, the former CIA clandestine operations officer, tells the Tehran Times that what Halley played on the scene was the same kind as Colin Powell executed before the United Nations when he lied about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Nikky Haley, United States Ambassador to the United Nations accused Iran for delivery of the fired ballistic missile by Houthis into Riyadh by playing a funny show on Thursday while Iran has strongly rejected Haley’s accusations against Tehran. To illustrate this matter more, we have discussed to Robert David Steele, the former CIA clandestine operations officer to understand the real intentions of Haley behind of her attacks to Tehran. Steele accused Haley to know nothing about realities of the international order and said: “Nikki Haley means well but she is an idiot — completely ignorant — about global reality.” “In light of a US secret intelligence community that is largely worthless and too easily deceived by the Zionists”, the former CIA officer said to Tehran Times.  He also accused Haley and Saudi Arabia to try for creation of a fake war scenario against Iran. “from their "talking rocks" fakiing signals to their pre-arrangement with Saudi Arabia for a false flag missile attack that is miraculously intercepted by the generally inept Saudi Air Force”, Steele said.  The former CIA agent also reminded the famous show of Colin Powell, the Former United States National Security Advisor who scared the world and seduced UN officials for existence of enormous amount of mass destruction weapons in Iraq in order to justify US attack against Saddam Hussein regime and said: “it is safe to say that Haley is part of a US deception operation, similar to what Colin Powell executed before the United Nations when he lied about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction that we all knew did not exist.”  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
