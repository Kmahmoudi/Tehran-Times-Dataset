TEHRAN – Tehran says it does not want its relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan to be affected by the Karabakh conflict, IRNA reported. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday the conflict should be resolved based on international regulations and through dialogue. “Iran continues to follow its principled and rational policies with this regard,” he added. Pointing to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s visit to Tehran, Qassemi said, “As I’ve repeatedly said the stance of the Islamic Republic of Iran toward its neighbors is clear and transparent.” “[Our] neighbors are the top priority of Iran’s foreign policy,” he added.
