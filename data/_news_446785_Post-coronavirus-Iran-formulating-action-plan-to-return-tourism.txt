TEHRAN – Iran’s tourism has announced it is developing an action plan to get the country’s travel back on track after the threat of novel coronavirus is over. Like many other countries, Iran’s travel industry has suffered huge losses in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. “Very good plans have been made in this regard for the time after the containment of the coronavirus, and I am confident that we will once again see a boom in the tourism industry and compensate the losses, Vali Teymouri, the deputy tourism minister, said on Tuesday. “The virus has targeted travels and communication, and the [global] tourism industry has suffered the most from the virus to such an extent that never happened since World War II,” CHTN quoted Teymouri as saying on Tuesday. “The damage was more severe for our country because we faced this problem at the high season of our domestic trip,” he said. “In other words, we witnessed the outbreak of this virus during the golden time of Nowruz, which is (traditionally) the heyday of our domestic and foreign tourism.” The official, however, didn’t provide further detail on the ministry’s plan to jumpstart tourism.
