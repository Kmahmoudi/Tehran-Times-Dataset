TEHRAN- In a phone conversation on Thursday night, the interior ministers of Iran and Turkey lamented terrorist assaults that had occurred in both countries and called for closer bilateral and regional collaboration in fighting terrorism. Iranian Interior Minister Amhad Vahidi and Turkey’s Suleyman Soylu stressed the need to work together to combat terrorism, deport criminals, and battle drug trafficking. In response to the terrorist attack that occurred the day before in a square in Istanbul, the Iranian interior minister expressed sympathy with his Turkish counterpart and reiterated that "Iran and Turkey have common enemies and must seriously cooperate in the campaign against terrorism and the disturbers of both countries' security." Vahidi cited the recent U.S., Britain, Saudi Arabia, and Zionist regime’s support for vandals and rioters in Iran, stating that "in the past, their schemes in favor of sedition experienced a loss, and in the current events, they will undoubtedly meet a devastating defeat." He added, "The Islamic Republic of Iran has always backed a strong and stable Turkey, realizing that the strength and security of the two nations is not only to the interest of both, but also to the benefit of the whole region."  Vahidi, president of the Iran’s National Security Council, also appreciated offer by his Turkish counterpart to visit Ankara and promised to meet him as soon as it is feasible. Turkish interior minister said the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Turkey enjoy long-standing and strategic relations. "We have always favored evermore strengthening of Ankara-Tehran relations, believing this is to the benefit of the two nations and our two countries," Soylu remarked. There are certain people, he continued, who want to sour Turkey's relations with Iran, but they should be aware that Turkish and Iranian leaders embrace close ties and would never allow outsiders to interfere with their cordial connections. The Turkish interior minister added, “We are certain that the Islamic Republic of Iran's senior authorities would manage the recent events in Iran, which have attracted the attention of some foreign countries, sensibly and by taking the necessary steps.” Soylu also said, "We are witness to strong and satisfied bilateral collaboration in the sphere of border transitions, and the existing camera surveillance in border regions will assist to further strengthening of border security."
