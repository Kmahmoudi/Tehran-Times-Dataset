TEHRAN â€“ Despite existing five schools special for autistic boy students in Tehran, there still exists no school for girls suffering the disease, said Seyed Mohammad Ali Miri, an official with Iran Autism Association here on Sunday. The first school for autistic girls was planned to be opened by the new school year (September 23) in Tehran, IRNA quoted Miri as saying. The Special Education Organization is planning for formation of a school for autistic girls, the official said, however, it was not accomplished. Since the prevalence of autism is higher in boys the greater number of special schools for autistic boys is logical, he added, explaining that the prevalence of autism in boys is four to one comparing with girls. Currently, students with autism are studying at 25 public schools and 15 private schools, he stated. One of the best schools for children suffering autism, equipped with the standards facilities in Iran, has been set up in Ahvaz province, southwestern Iran, and the second one is under construction, he remarked, adding that some autism schools are under construction in other provinces, including Qazvin, Kermanshah, and Khorasan Razavi. Also, some of the northern provinces of the country are looking forward to build autism schools. Autism is a complex neurobehavioral condition that includes impairments in social interaction and developmental language and communication skills combined with rigid, repetitive behaviors. Because of the range of symptoms, this condition is now called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). According to the latest statistics, out of every 65 births in the world, one child suffers autism spectrum disorder. In Iran, out of every 150 births, one child suffers autism spectrum disorder.
