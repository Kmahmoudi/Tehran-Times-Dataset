TEHRAN – Iranian exporters of handicrafts are no longer required to exchange their export currencies at the Forex Management Integrated System, locally known as NIMA. The privilege is gained following constant efforts made by the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization to support the budding trade. “This exceptions cause a wave of happiness for handicrafts exporters yet secures booming of the non-oil trade… which is deemed as vulnerable,” ILNA quoted CHHTO deputy director Pouya Mahmoudian as saying on Sunday. “In a recent meeting with handcrafted exporters, they voiced that one of their serious concerns is excessive bureaucracy and paper work in the NIMA system,” she added. According to data compiled by the CHHTO, Iran exported $280 million worth of handicrafts during the past Iranian calendar year, ended on March 20. Germany, Armenia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Russia, the Netherlands, France, Italy, South Africa and the Persian Gulf littoral states constitute the main importers of Iranian handicrafts. Back in April, the Central Bank of Iran launched the NIMA system in a bid to counter shortage of foreign currencies as the Trump administration is restoring sanctions against Iran, mainly targeting Tehran’s oil revenues.
