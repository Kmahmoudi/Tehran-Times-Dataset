TEHRAN – Chairman of the Majlis Nuclear Committee Mojtaba Zonnour has called on the Foreign Ministry to take a firm stance against Poland’s decision to host an anti-Iran summit. “The Islamic Republic must take an assertive stance against these insults and audacity, and must not go easy on them,” Mehr on Tuesday quoted Zonnour as saying. The lawmaker also said European countries are as unreliable as the United States, adding, “For now, the Islamic Republic believes in talks with Europeans so that maybe something, say the SPV, occurs, but it doesn’t mean we rely on them.” MH/ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
