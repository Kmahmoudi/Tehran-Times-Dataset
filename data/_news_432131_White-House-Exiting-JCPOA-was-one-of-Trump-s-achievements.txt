TEHRAN – The White House has named U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May as one of President Donald Trump’s “historic results” in his first two years in office. “President Trump announced a new Iran strategy to confront all of Iran’s malign activities and withdrew from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal,” the White House said in a statement on Sunday, counting Trump’s so-called achievements. It said all sanctions that had been lifted or waived under the deal have been reimposed, adding that the Trump administration has sanctioned more than 160 individuals tied to what it claimed was Iran’s “support of terrorism, ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and more.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
