TEHRAN _At least two militants including the one allegedly involved in the murder of prominent Kashmiri journalist Shujaat Bukhari were killed in an encounter with security forces in central Kashmir’s Budgam district on Wednesday. One of the militants has been identified Naveed Jatt, who alledgedly played a role in Bukhari’s assassination in June this year. Bukhari, editor-in-chief of Rising Kashmir, was attacked by three bike-borne gunmen while coming out of his office. J&K Police said two of the three gunmen were from Kashmir and the third was a Pakistani. Two security personnel accompanying Bukhari were also killed in the attack. “This week was great, those involved in killing of innocent people in Kulgam, Pulwama & Shopian belt were neutralized. As per ground verification, top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Naveed Jatt was one of the 2 terrorists killed today,” Jammu Kashmir DGP Dilbagh Singh was quoted saying by ANI. The encounter broke out after security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Chattergam village of Budgam. As the forces were zeroing in on target house, militants opened fire triggering the encounter.   Jatt was one of the dreaded militant commanders in Kashmir who was on the hit-list of security agencies for many years. In recent years, since the killing of former militant commander Burhan Wani, militancy has been resurrected in Kashmir with many locals taking up arms.
