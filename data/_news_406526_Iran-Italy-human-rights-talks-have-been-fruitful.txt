TEHRAN – Deputy Secretary of the Iranian Human Rights Council Khosro Hakimi has said the dialogue on human rights between Iran and Italy have been fruitful, ISNA reported on Sunday. Hakimi said that such talks give Iran the opportunity to introduce its Islamic-based human rights principles to other countries so that they can see more clearly the difference between the Islamic Republic’s justice system and other countries’.  “The negotiations are a clear sign of the Islamic Republic’s determination to expand ties with other countries under favorable conditions,” Hakimi said.  Iranian human rights delegation, led by Javad Larijani, was in Rome for a new round of talks on human rights between Iran and Italy.  The human rights official said the third round of talks was held to discuss human rights protection in both countries’ criminal justice system.  Hakimi added, “Some other Western countries have also called for the expansion of judicial ties with Iran in order to discuss human rights issues.”  During the new round of Iran-Italy talks on human rights, the two sides discussed issues such as the rights of the accused, women’s rights, children’s rights, and fairness in the judiciary system of Iran and Italy.  At the end of the third round of talks, both countries agreed that Tehran should host the next round.  The two sides also underscored the need to promote bilateral ties in the areas of human rights and judicial systems, as both Iran and Italy share similarities in their justice system.
