TEHRAN- Iran’s air fleet needs 551 new airplanes by the Iranian calendar year 1404 (March 2025- March 2026), transport minister Abbas Akhoundi announced on Wednesday. As IRNA quoted him, the Iranian air fleet includes 266 airplanes, 100 of which are grounded due to their old age. 
“The average age of in-service airplanes in Iran is around 23 years and they should go out of service within a year according to international standards,” he added. 
Following Iran’s nuclear deal with the world’s major powers and lifting of sanctions against the country, the Islamic Republic made renovation of its ageing air fleet one of its top priorities.
The first deal after the nuclear accord was signed in January with Airbus. The Iranian flag carrier, Iran Air, agreed to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion from Airbus.
Akhoundi announced on Tuesday that the agreement on purchasing Airbus planes will be concluded within the next three or four weeks.
Also, Boeing Co. said Tuesday it signed an agreement with Iran Air "expressing the airline's intent" to buy its aircraft, marking the first major deal with an American company in the Islamic Republic following its landmark nuclear deal. 
The Chicago-based manufacturer issued a statement to The Associated Press saying that it signed the agreement "under authorizations from the U.S. government following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord reached last summer."
