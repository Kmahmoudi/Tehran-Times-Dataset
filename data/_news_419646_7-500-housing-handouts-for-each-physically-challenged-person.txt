TEHRAN — Iran’s Welfare Organization is granting 300-million-rial (nearly $7,500) housing handouts to persons with disabilities, ISNA reported on Saturday. Anoushirvan Mohseni-Bandpey, head of the Welfare Organization, noted that the organization’s priority is to provide treatment services to persons with disabilities at home instead of medical or health-care facilities. Currently some 53,000 houses for families with one, two or more persons with disabilities are either under construction or are already constructed in the country, Mohseni-Bandpey added.
