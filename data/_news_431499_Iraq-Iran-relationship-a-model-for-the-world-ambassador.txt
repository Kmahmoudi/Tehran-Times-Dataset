TEHRAN – The Iranian Ambassador to Baghdad, Iraj Masjedi, has described the strong relationship between Iran and Iraq as a “successful model” of cooperation between two neighboring countries on the world stage. Speaking at the Iraqi National Defense University in Baghdad on Saturday, Masjedi said Iran’s approach toward Iraq is not based on sectarianism, rather it views the Arab state as a brotherly country, IRNA reported. He underlined that Iraq will not have a “more sincere friend” than Iran. The ambassador asserted that the Islamic Republic does not bully other countries and it does not tolerate bullying as well. Tehran respects the sovereignty and dignity of other nations, Ambassador Masjedi remarked. Pointing to U.S. bullying of other countries, Masjedi asked, “Why does the U.S. have military bases and forces in so many countries? Why does the U.S. think others must obey its orders?” “With this regard, we as the Islamic Republic of Iran oppose U.S. bullying,” he added. The diplomat also said Iran has good political and economic relations with all countries, especially neighbors.  Describing Iran’s relations with Iraq as a “strategic friendship”, the envoy said the Islamic Republic is seeking peace, friendship and brotherly ties with Iraq. Iran is rooting for an “Iraq which is powerful and advanced in all fields,” he said, adding, “Iraq’s progress pleases us and we will spare no efforts in helping with Iraq’s progress.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
