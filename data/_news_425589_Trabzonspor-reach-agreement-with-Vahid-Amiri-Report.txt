TEHRAN - Turkish media reported that Persepolis midfielder Vahid Amiri has reached an agreement with Trabzonspor. The Tukish club have already negotiated with Iranian international defenders Majid Hosseini and Pejman Montazri. Amiri, who represented Iran national football team against Morocco, Spain and Portugal in Group B of the 2018 World Cup, is a free agent player and has yet to extend his contract with Iran’s Persepolis. Amiri, 30, will reportedly undergo the exam to determine if he is healthy enough to join Trabzonspor. Al-Rayyan of Qatar and Ukraine’s Dynamo Kiev have also showed interest in signing the midfielder.
