TEHRAN – Iran’s Ambassador to the UN Gholamali Khoshroo says the International Atomic Energy Agency is the only authority to verify Iran’s fulfillment of safeguards obligations under its nuclear agreement with world powers, the JCPOA. “Iran stresses that IAEA --an independent intergovernmental, science and technology-based organization-- is the sole competent authority responsible for the verification of the fulfillment of safeguards obligations,” Khoshroo said in an address to the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly on Agenda Item 89: Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency, held in New York on Friday. The full transcript of his speech is as follows: I would like to begin by thanking the distinguished Director-General of the IAEA for his report. The Islamic Republic of Iran underscores the importance of full realization of the inalienable right of any State to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This includes the inherent right of each State to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As stated in Article II of the IAEA Statute, “The Agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world.” In this context, Iran emphasizes the importance of statutory functions and primary responsibility of the Agency to assist Member States in research on, and practical application of, nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Appreciating related activities of the Agency, Iran stresses the need for further enhancement of such activities, particularly to meet the expectations of developing countries. It should be ensured that the Technical Cooperation Program of the Agency remains firm and sustainable through sufficient, assured and predictable financial and human resources. Iran stresses that IAEA — an independent intergovernmental, science and technology-based organization — is the sole competent authority responsible for the verification of the fulfillment of safeguards obligations. Related functions of the Agency should be carried out in full conformity with the relevant legally-binding instruments, and take into account the concerns and interests of Member States, in particular, by strict observance of the principle of confidentiality. Taking into account the growing applications of nuclear energy and its role in the socio-economic development of societies, Iran is determined to vigorously continue to exercise its inalienable right to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy, including development of a full national nuclear fuel cycle, for peaceful purposes. Iran's full compliance with all its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement and fulfillment of its commitments under the JCPOA has been confirmed in numerous reports of the IAEA, as the sole relevant competent international authority. Thus, any claim that Iran is not complying with its JCPOA commitments lacks relevance and credibility. As a valid international instrument, JCPOA neither can be renegotiated nor unilaterally annulled. Likewise, any unilateral claim to extend the duration of Iran's voluntary confidence building measures runs counter to the JCPOA and, more importantly, is in clear contradiction with the inalienable rights of States under the NPT. Iran has been and will remain fully committed to the JCPOA inasmuch as all other JCPOA participants also fully and timely fulfill all their related commitments. JCPOA participants are therefore urged to genuinely carry out all their commitments and refrain from any action inconsistent with its provisions. This indeed is in the interest of JCPOA participants and the international community of States as a whole. Therefore, current supports for the full implementation of the JCPOA by all its participants need to be continued.
