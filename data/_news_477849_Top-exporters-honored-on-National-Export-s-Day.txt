TEHRAN – Iran’s exemplary exporters were honored at the 26th National Export’s Day ceremony which was held at Tehran Summit Hall on Saturday by Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) in collaboration with Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA). The ceremony was attended by President Ebrahim Raisi, Industry, Mining and Trade Minister Reza Fatemi Amin, TPO Head Alireza Peyman-Pak, and Vice President for Economic Affairs Mohsen Rezaei, the TPO portal reported. Exports significantly increased despite sanctions Opening the ceremony, Raisi said the growth of export in the country can be seen despite all the sanctions and threats. "Over 40 percent growth of the country's exports last year and 13 percent increase of non-oil exports this year shows the determination of our traders for growing the country’s exports," President Raisi said. "The committees that work for the growth of exports and removing the obstacles facing exporters should pay more attention to the views and opinions of exporters," he added. Referring to the naming of this year by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution as the year of Knowledge-based Production and Job-creation, the president stated, "This year, all our efforts should be in the direction of production growth, especially knowledge-based and technology-based production." Referring to the expansion of economic relations with the countries of the region, the president said, "We must revive Iran's share in the economic interactions of the region, including in the transit of goods, monetary and financial circulation, and other economic fields." Iran’s trade balance to become positive next year Further in the event, Fatemi Amin referred to the growing trend of exports versus imports and closing the gap between the two, saying: “If the current trend continues next year, the country's trade balance will become positive.” The minister noted that many countries around the world are in fact exporting to be able to import their needed commodities, saying: “Any country that can export more will have a better economic condition and this means a positive trade balance.” According to the official, last year's total imports were $52 billion while the exports stood at $47 billion which means the country’s trade balance was five billion dollars negative; in the first six months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 22-September 22), however, the difference has been reduced to two billion dollars, and soon for the next year this gap will be completely closed. Govt. determined to develop non-oil exports Also speaking at the ceremony, Peyman-Pak said the presence of President Raisi in this ceremony is an indication of the importance that the government is placing upon exports. Underlining the positive measures taken by the 13th government administration for the development of the country’s non-oil trade, the official said: “These actions are pursued in two parts, one of the most important parts of which is issues regarding the removal of obstacles.” As a major player in the country’s foreign trade, TPO has also implemented its programs purposefully, Peyman-Pak emphasized. “Our programs include attending international exhibitions such as the Moscow exhibition and exchanging trade delegations, which had good results,” the official added. Referring to the plans for the presence in green and emerging markets such as Africa, Eurasia, and Southeast Asia, he added: “over 40 business delegations from Africa have come to Iran since the beginning of the year, and next week, a group of 31 managers from large companies in Russia and Belarus will visit Iran.” ***Private sector calls for establishing “foreign trade council” Finally, addressing the ceremony, ICCIMA Head Gholam-Hossein Shafeie said the private sector, as the major driving force of the country’s economy, is calling on the government to facilitate and accelerate the establishment of a Foreign Trade Council in order to create integration in economic policies and pay more attention to global developments. Shafeie stated that unified management is one of the important and old needs of the economy, the lack of which has caused serious damage to the economic development process of the country. According to TPO, this year, more than 612 export companies from 69 different product and service groups were assessed in order to select distinguished exporters, among which 57 top exporters were selected and rewarded.
