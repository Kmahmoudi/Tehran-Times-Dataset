TEHRAN - Iran exported 780 million barrels of crude oil from Kharg Island terminal in south part of the country during the last Iranian calendar year 1395 (ended on March 20), which indicates an 80 percent rise compared to the preceding year (1394). According to the head of Iran Oil Terminals Company (IOTC)'s Export Department Gholamhossein Gerami, the figure stood at 432 million barrels in 1394, Shana reported. Gerami further noted that during the last Iranian calendar year more than 800 oil tankers harbored in Kharg Island for loading crude oil while in the previous year the number hardly reached 540. According to the official, IOTC plans to modernize the country’s fleet in the current Iranian calendar year. Renting and building new vessels, subsea repairs, training human resources, construction of floating docks, updating certificates, descaling of tanks, signing swap contracts and exporting oil extracted from West Karoun fields (in southwest Iran) through Kharg Oil Terminal are among measures to be taken in this regard, he added. Due to its close distance to oilfield regions, its good offshore position and suitable depth for gigantic oil vessels berthing, Kharg Island Oil Terminal has been recognized as one of the country’s most suitable place for crude oil export and loading sites.
