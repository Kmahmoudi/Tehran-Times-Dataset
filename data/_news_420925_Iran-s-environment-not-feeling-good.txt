TEHRAN – Iran’s Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is the lowest among 180 countries, Parliamentarian Mohammad Reza Tabesh said on Friday, noting that “today, the country’s environment is not feeling okay.” Tabesh said although comprehensive plans have been implemented in order to protect the environment, the destruction process has put wetlands in serious danger, IRNA reported. He also called on the three branches of government as well as the nation to do whatever they can in order to preserve the environment.
