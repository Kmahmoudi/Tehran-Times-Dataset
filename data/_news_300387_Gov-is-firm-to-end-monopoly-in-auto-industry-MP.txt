TEHRAN- MP Kamaladdin Pirmoazen has said the Rouhani government is determined to put an end to “monopoly” in manufacturing of “expensive” and yet “low quality” vehicles by paving the way for the entry of international and private automakers in the industry. Among other goals set by the government are improving the quality and fuel efficiency of cars, ISNA quoted Pirmoazen as saying on Friday. With the new investments, more job opportunities will be created and more capital can be attracted by persuading international brands to invest in the industry, said Pirmoazen who sits on the Majlis Mining and Industry Committee. Trying to put an end to the monopoly, the government is also looking at regional countries as target markets for cars produced at home, he added. The current condition of Iranian car industry is a result of years of sanctions on the country and lack of transparency, making it easy for abusers and brokers to stay on top of the industry and prevent it from developing, the MP added. With the sanctions lifted and through transparent policies taken by the government, Iranians in the very near future will see better vehicles with lower prices in the market, he said.        All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
