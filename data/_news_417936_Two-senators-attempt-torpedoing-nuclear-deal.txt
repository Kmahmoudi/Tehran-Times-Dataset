TEHRAN – Two U.S. senators have attempted torpedoing the international Iran nuclear deal by drafting a legislation that starkly contradicts the deal. Republican Senators Bob Corker and Tom Cotton are reportedly working on new draft legislation that would set tough terms for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in response to President Donald Trump’s refusal to certify Tehran’s compliance with the 2015 accord. The draft sets tough new terms for the nuclear deal, including restoration of sanctions if Iran tests a ballistic missile capable of carrying a warhead or prevents nuclear inspectors from visiting any sites. The motion, it was reported, was already under preparation when Trump delivered his anti-Iran speech on October 13, in which he said he would not be certifying Iran’s compliance with the terms of the JCPOA under a domestic American law, kicking to Congress a decision on whether to restore sanctions against Iran. Trump did not pull Washington out of the JCPOA, but he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to re-impose the economic sanctions against Tehran that were lifted under the pact. The draft legislation is a naked alteration of the JCPOA and UN Resolution 2231 which backs it. While the resolution advises Iran only against developing “missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons”, Cotton and Corker’s proposal dismisses to recognize any ballistic missile capable of carrying a warhead.
