Israeli soldiers assaulted Palestinian worshippers inside al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem on Tuesday night and forcibly removed hundreds from the site who were peacefully observing the holy month of Ramadan. Israeli forces stormed and attacked the worshippers with sound bombs, bullets, and tear gas. According to Al Jazeera, at least 400 Palestinians were arrested and remain in Israeli custody, according to Palestinian officials. They are being held at a police station in Atarot in occupied al-Quds. Videos from inside the mosque also show the destruction of a part of the Al-Aqsa Mosque during the military attack on this religious place. Meanwhile, Palestinian youths demonstrated in support of the al-Aqsa Mosque at night in different areas of occupied Al-Quds and clashed with Israeli soldiers. The raid at Al-Aqsa started around 10 pm local time when police officers were first spotted entering the site.  Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political office of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), said what is happening in the Al-Aqsa Mosque is an "unprecedented crime" and called on the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the territories occupied in 1948 to go to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and protect it from the attack.  In a relevant story, Israeli planes have attacked multiple sites in Gaza. The raids took place early on Wednesday morning. All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
