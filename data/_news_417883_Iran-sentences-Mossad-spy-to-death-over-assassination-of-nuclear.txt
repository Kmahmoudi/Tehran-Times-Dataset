TEHRAN – The Tehran prosecutor said on Tuesday that an Iranian national working for Mossad has been sentenced to death for revealing secret information to the Israeli spy agency.

He also said the espionage led to the assassination of two top nuclear scientists, Masoud Alimohammadi and Majid Shahriari, by Mossad agents.
