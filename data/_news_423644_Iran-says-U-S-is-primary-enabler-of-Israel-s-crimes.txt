Iran’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the U.S. is the “primary enabler” of 70 years of Israeli crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories.
 On Monday, Israeli snipers killed 62 Palestinians including children as they were peacefully marking the 70th anniversary of the expulsion of 700,000 people during the creation of Israel. There has been widespread international condemnation of Monday’s violence and the UN Security Council met Tuesday in response. The U.S. ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, defended Israel and said: “No country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry called the massacre of Palestinians a “war crime” that should be brought to the International Court of Justice. “Yesterday (Monday), the U.S. and the Israeli regime jointly celebrated the shameful violation of international law, including both international humanitarian and human rights law, as well as many UN resolutions, showing again that the United States is the primary enabler of 70 years of Israeli crimes, including the ongoing bloodbath in Gaza,” read the statement by Iran’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations.  Following is full text of the statement published by IRNA: When the world cries over the massacre of dozens and the injuring of thousands of innocent unarmed Palestinian civilian protesters, including women and children, and while the Security Council has convened an emergency meeting to address this terrible crime, the United States Permanent Representative chose to talk about Iran, and NOT the Israeli regime’s appalling crimes.  The United States Permanent Representative leveled tired and nonsensical allegations against Iran simply to distract from the global call to put an immediate end to the brutal mass murder in Gaza. She doubled down on a policy of unconditional support for the Israeli regime and its illegal and aggressive practices that has become the obvious source of instability and insecurity in the region. Yesterday, the U.S. and the Israeli regime jointly celebrated the shameful violation of international law, including both international humanitarian and human rights law, as well as many UN resolutions, showing again that the United States is the primary enabler of 70 years of Israeli crimes, including the ongoing bloodbath in Gaza, and the remarks by the U.S. representative cannot conceal this fact. The Islamic Republic of Iran once again asks all nations to apply real pressure on the Israeli regime to immediately stop killing of the innocent protesters in Gaza, the world’s largest prison.
