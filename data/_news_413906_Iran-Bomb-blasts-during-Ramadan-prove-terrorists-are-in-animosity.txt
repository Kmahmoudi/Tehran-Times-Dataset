TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi condemned on Tuesday two blasts in Baghdad which left at least 27 people killed and many more wounded.
 Qassemi said the “criminal act” during the holy month of Ramadan – the fasting months for Muslims - proves the fact that the Takfiri terrorist groups have animosity towards the nature of Islam. He described the terrorist explosions as the “last desperate efforts by the terrorists to find a way out of their defeat in Iraq”. Qassemi also said the fight against terrorists in Iraq is near to final victory.  Two car bombs went off in Baghdad. The first bomb took place outside a popular ice cream shop in the predominantly Shia district of Karrada in Baghdad early on Tuesday, killing 16 people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the first blast. The second explosion occurred a few hours later, during rush hour near the state-run Public Pension Office near the al-Shahada (Martyrs’) Bridge in the busy Shawaka district, killing at least 12 and wounding 23 more. There has been no claim of responsibility for the second blast; however, the ISIS bears it most probably.
