TEHRAN - Mohammad-Kazem Sajjadpour, director of the Center for Political and International Studies at the Foreign Ministry, has said that destiny and security of the Persian Gulf littoral states are intertwined.
 “Some states assume that they can protect their security at the cost of undermining security of others which is a wrong assumption that causes insecurity,” he told ISNA in an interview published on Sunday. He added, “Insecurity and political and economic chaos in one country affect its neighbors and no actor can be indifferent towards such issues in other countries. Neighborliness is intertwined with the issues of common interests.” Sajjadpour also noted that “buying security” through reliance on extra-regional countries is a “security disease gripping the Middle East region”. He expressed regret over the fact that certain regional countries have a mentality that originates from their “tribal tendencies” and set hope on extra-regional powers. “If they think properly about the issue of security in the region, they will understand that regional security should be provided by the regional countries,” the diplomat remarked. Elsewhere, he said that Iran is the only country in the region which relies on its own people for security.
