TEHRAN – Zimbabwe’s Industry and Commerce Minister Mike Bimha and Iranian Ambassador to Harare Ahmad Erfanian met on Monday to discuss ways of developing economic and trade relations between the two countries. According to IRNA, in the meeting Erfanian noted that despite the two countries’ good political relations, the economic cooperation is not satisfactory.
“The two sides have little knowledge about each other’s potentials and capabilities and this can be compensated for by exchanging trade delegations, signing trade agreements and facilitating the activity of the two sides’ private sectors,” he said.
