The cellar has one entrance and 52 steps to reach to the lowest level where a water depot is located. The most important characteristic of the cellar is its buried water in the ground. The entire structure was built of clay and lime. The water reservoir was still in use until 40 years ago in the collection of Amir Chakhmaq Mosque. Visited by a great number of tourists each day, Amir Chakhmaq Cellar is now a significant part of Water Museum in Yazd.
