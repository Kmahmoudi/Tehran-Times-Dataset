TEHRAN -- Startups and technology accelerators play a great role in energy ecosystem, Sirus Vatankhah, an official with the vice president’s office for science and technology affairs has said. He called the field of energy very critical in sustainable development of the country, Mehr reported. Unfortunately, optimization of energy consumption is not satisfactory neither in supply nor in demand, he said during Energy Startup Day, which was held on Saturday. The official lamented the absence of startups in the field of energy supply and demand as well as transportation. He pointed to technological development in the field of optimization of energy consumption, which can make crucial changes in marketing. “About 20 percent of energy loss belongs to residential buildings, which can be reduced by offering technological solutions to citizens,” he said.
