Urging unified action in face of the United States’ new Middle East policy, Rouhani said he had no doubt that the Palestinian nation, backed by the Islamic Ummah, will force the American-Zionist move down the path to failure. Rouhani said Palestinian resistance  He said the new move proved the U.S. and Israel’s lack of regard for the Palestinian rights. The heads of state of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation will meet in Istanbul, Turkey, on Wednesday to take decision about the new U.S. move against Palestine.
