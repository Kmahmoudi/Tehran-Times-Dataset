TEHRAN – Iran ranks first among countries in Asia and fourth in the world in renal transplantation, the head of the Kidney Foundation of Iran announced on Monday.
 In 430 dialysis centers across Iran, some 1,800 to 2,000 kidney transplantation are performed annually, IRNA quoted Hashem Qasemi as saying.   Despite measures taken to add to dialysis machines, “We still face shortage of over 1,000 dialysis machines in the country,” Qasemi regretted.   He added that Iranian researchers have been able to manufacture medical equipment, including dialysis machines, domestically, so that not only the country’s needs are met but also some of the equipment can be exported. To prevent kidney diseases, Qasemi recommended that everyone get tested for the disease and watch its risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, a family history of kidney failure and those at the age of 60 or older.  The Kidney Foundation has 170 branches and representatives in Iran and currently runs with over 65,000 members. Kidney disease often has no symptoms, and it can go undetected until very advanced. But a simple urine test or a blood test can tell you if you have kidney disease.  Remember, it’s important to get tested because early detection and treatment can slow or prevent the progression of kidney disease.
