Boeing is studying the passenger plane needs of Iranian airlines.
"We're following the licensing process outlined by the U.S. government," the company told Trend on June 8.
 "Accordingly, we have applied for and received a license to assess the current commercial passenger airplane needs of U.S. Government-approved Iranian airlines," Boeing's representative told Trend. The license permits the company to engage approved Iranian airlines to determine their actual fleet requirements. "Our European competitor, Airbus, is advancing its interests in the market, and Canada recently indicated that it will permit Bombardier access to the Iranian market as well. We understand that the situation in the region is complicated and ever changing and we will continue to follow the U.S. government's guidance as it relates to conducting business with Iran," said the company. Iran signed a major deal worth $27 billion with Airbus in January to purchase 118 planes from the company. The deal with Airbus was sealed during a state visit to Paris by Iran's President Hassan Rouhani. Iran has announced its need for about 400 passenger planes in the next decade to modernize its ageing fleet. Iranian airlines are not interested in buying any more Russian planes. Their performance was unsatisfactory when flown in the country's aviation market during the sanctions period. Iran hopes to improve the relations with the world in the wake of the nuclear deal to renovate their fleet with western aircraft. Iran's flag carrier, Iran Air recently announced that is discussing what is seen as a "historic aircraft purchase deal" with Boeing. Confirming the negotiations, Boeing did not provide any details of the ongoing talks.
