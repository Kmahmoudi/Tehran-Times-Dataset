TEHRAN — The Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment centers offering comprehensive programs for the evaluation and treatment of MS patients, will be set up in all provinces of the country, deputy health minister has said.  “There are nearly 60,000 MS patients in the country, and fortunately, MS care centers are currently operating in some provinces of the country,” Tasnim quoted Qasem Janbabaei as saying on Tuesday. In spite of providing proper services to these patients already in other provinces, it is planned to launch more of these centers nationwide as soon as possible, he added.  He went on to say that the aforesaid centers offer services including diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and even psychological counseling. The team approach benefits healthcare professionals and their patients, whether it occurs in an MS comprehensive care center or through active communication and collaboration among clinicians in the community.“Thanks to efforts of health professionals and experts, over 250 clinical guidelines have been developed, that MS patients are among the issues addressed in these guidelines, and services are provided to the patients regarding them,” he highlighted. In such economic situation, the Ministry of Health’s priority is the patients suffering such diseases, and soon will open some 64 special diseases care centers, he concluded. Multiple sclerosis is the most widespread disabling neurological condition of young adults around the world. Most people develop MS between the ages of 20 and 50. According to Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, nearly 2.3 million people live with MS globally, only 4 to 5 percent of all diagnosed MS cases are in children. The incidence of MS is also higher in colder climates. People of Northern European descent have the highest risk of developing MS, no matter where they live. Meanwhile, the lowest risk appears to be among Native Americans, Africans, and Asians. In Canada some 291 per 100,000 individuals are diagnosed with MS, which takes the first place among countries with the highest prevalence of the disease, then San Marino and Denmark come after Canada. MS comprehensive care The advanced care needs of many individuals with MS and their families are not being adequately addressed. Too often, complex MS symptoms interfere with health, safety, independence and quality of life while co-morbid health conditions and complications can increase disability and potentially shorten a person’s life. Family members often feel left to their own devices as they provide care for a loved one while trying to manage additional responsibilities at home and at work and attend to their own health needs. According to the National MS Society website MS is a chronic degenerative condition, with heterogeneous symptoms, and an unpredictable prognosis.  A clinician working in isolation will tend to focus on those aspects of the disease with which he or she feels most comfortable and has the greatest expertise, often without recognizing or addressing other important issues and only by sharing expertise in a coordinated and collaborative manner, can the complex needs of individuals with MS and their families be met.  The team approach benefits healthcare professionals and their patients, whether it occurs in an MS comprehensive care center or through active communication and collaboration among clinicians in the community.  Over the course of the disease, the MS care team – with the person with MS at its center – may need to include: neurologist, nurse, rehabilitation specialist (physiatrist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech/language pathologist, orthotist, and seating specialist), primary care physician, urologist, mental health specialist, neuropsychologist/psychologist, social worker and nutritionist.   FB/MQ/MG   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
