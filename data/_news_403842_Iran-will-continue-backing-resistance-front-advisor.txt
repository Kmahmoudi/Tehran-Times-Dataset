 “Tehran will continue its strong support for the axis of resistance and considers it a vital issue for regional peace, stability and security and also for countering terrorism and Zionism,” he told IRIB in an interview published on Wednesday. He said that the axis of resistance in Palestine, Lebanon and other countries in the region have played the most important role in helping establish security in the region. The former deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs also said Takfiri terrorism and the Zionist regime of Israel are “two edges of the same scissors” and serve the interests of the hegemonic system. Amir-Abdollahian also said that Hezbollah did not let the terrorists to decide about the future of Syria and help realize the interests of the Zionist regime. The veteran diplomat added, “The Zionists are enemy of the Islamic countries and it is wrong to establish ties with Tel Aviv. Some countries have hidden relations with Tel Aviv and will finally be victim of their strategic mistake.” Elsewhere, he said that Quds Day signifies the culmination of resistance against the Zionist regime. Quds Day is an annual event held on the last Friday of Ramadan to express support for the Palestinians and oppose Zionism as well as Israel’s control of Jerusalem.
