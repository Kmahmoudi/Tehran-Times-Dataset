TEHRAN – Presidential candidate Ebrahim Raisi has said all presidential candidates who wish to win the upcoming election should have plans for resolving the country’s problems, IRNA reported. “We have an applicable plan drafted by the country’s academics and researchers,” Raisi said on Sunday during an address to well-wishers in Golestan Province. Criticizing the sitting administration, the presidential hopeful stressed that more important than having a plan is the determination to act on it and overcome the problems.
