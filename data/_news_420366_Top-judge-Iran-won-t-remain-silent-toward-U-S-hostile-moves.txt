TEHRAN – Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani said on Monday that the U.S. should be aware that Iran will give appropriate response to any hostile move.
 During a meeting with a number of high-ranking judges, he said Tehran will not remain silent towards the U.S. act in imposing new sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed new sanctions on 14 Iranian individuals and entities including Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani. Amoli Larijani said that he is being sanctioned is an “honor” for him. “I personally consider this issue an honor. I believe this act of the U.S. proves the fact that the path we have taken is right. So, the U.S. act has no importance. The important point is that the Islamic Republic, as a powerful system, is taking step on the path of independence and the system’s officials have no fear because they are being backed by the people,” the top judge remarked. Commenting on the 2015 nuclear deal, he said the multilateral agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is not changeable. On Friday, Trump extended waivers of key economic sanctions on Iran for another 120 days. However, he said if the text of the deal is not revised during this period he would unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from it. NA/PA
