TEHRAN- According to a West Asia expert, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei in his Saturday remarks set an internal and foreign policy roadmap, particularly with regard to the United States, for officials and the vast Iranian nation, because appeasement does not prevent U.S. blackmail. Speaking to IRNA on Sunday, Hassan Hanizadeh said that the Leader strongly blasted the U.S. intimidating measures, describing them as an attempt by the U.S. to cross the Iranian nation's red lines. “The Leader of the Islamic Revolution's emphasis on the futility of appeasement with the U.S. demonstrates his correct and intellectual grasp of U.S. and Western policies, as well as the U.S. long-term aims of dominating regional states,” he remarked. He highlighted that one of the strategies that the U.S. has constantly sought to place on the table is weakening Iran's military and deterrence capabilities, which has nothing to do with the topic of nuclear talks. The analyst went on to say that “one example of the Leader's words was the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the 5+1 countries, which, despite having signed such an agreement, the U.S. withdrew from in 2018. It slapped nearly 1,700 sanctions against Iran until 2020.” “The U.S. assassination of Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, the former head of the Quds Force, demonstrated that diplomacy, appeasement, and adherence to U.S. goals do not stop the U.S. from acting aggressively,” Hanizadeh stressed.  He pointed out that “Iran's internal and national stability depends on internal unity and integration to combat these demands, and this is a definite policy, as evidenced by the U.S. excessive demands in recent years that have revealed, under a variety of pretexts, that the U.S. policies cannot be trusted.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
