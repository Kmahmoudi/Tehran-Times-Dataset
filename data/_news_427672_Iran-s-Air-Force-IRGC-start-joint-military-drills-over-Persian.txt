TEHRAN – The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) and the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) on Friday started joint military drills over the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman.
 The drills started on the occasion of the Sacred Defense Week. The Sacred Defense Week honors eight years of resistance against former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein who launched war against Iran on September 22, 1980. Colonel Yousuf Safipour from the Army’s Information and Public Relations Office told reporters that twenty-six military aircraft, including F-4s, Sukhoi-22s, and Tucanos, as well as five helicopter gunships, including Chinooks, are flown during the drills. “In addition to show of power, this ceremony sends message of peace and friendship to the neighboring countries,” Safipour said.   He added, “If the enemies and global arrogance covet the Islamic country's territory, they would be served with a crushing response within a fraction of a second.”  The second stage of military exercise is scheduled to be held on Saturday.
