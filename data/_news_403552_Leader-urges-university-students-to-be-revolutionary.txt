TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that universities and students should always be “revolutionary.”  During a meeting with a group of university professors and highly talented academicians and researchers, the Leader said “revolutionary” nature of universities and students is one of the requirements of turning the Islamic establishment into a “scientific power” and “role model of democracy with Islam and democracy”. “Speeding up the scientific growth of universities and scientific centers; creating and consolidating a sense of prideful Iranian-Islamic identity among the youth; maintaining a revolutionary spirit at universities and among students; and the efficient roles that must be played by soft war commanders and soldiers; thus, a distinguished scientific power will emerge as an example of democracy coupled with Islam and spirituality among the world,” Khamenei.ir quoted the Leader as saying. Ayatollah Khamenei touched on reports by credible documenting databases and journals from around the world in regards to Iran’s scientific achievements, adding: “These reports indicate the scientific achievements of Iran by saying Iran’s achievements are astonishing. Iran is an emerging scientific power; Iran seeks to transform from a resource-based economy into a knowledge-based economy; and Iran’s achievements in stem cells, nuclear science, aerospace, energy exchange and Information Technology are remarkable; this data should be available to the new generation so that aside from feeling a sense of identity, they take pride in being Iranian.” Students should be proud of being “Iranian”, “Muslim” and “revolutionary”, he said. He attached great importance to universities’ officials and status of professors in presenting the country’s prospect to students who will run the country in future. He also said that there should be “scientific progress”, “moral discipline”, “religious self-restraint” and “political insight” in the university’s atmosphere. The Leader added that there can be various political orientations in universities; however, those political inclinations which are against the revolution should not be supported. He called on the senior officials of the higher education to be careful and not let the universities be turned into place of “divergence from the revolution’s values”. Elsewhere, the Leader highlighted the importance of the resistant economy, saying that implementation of the resistant economy will fulfill the country’s needs and protect “national dignity” if it is implemented if in the real sense of the word.
