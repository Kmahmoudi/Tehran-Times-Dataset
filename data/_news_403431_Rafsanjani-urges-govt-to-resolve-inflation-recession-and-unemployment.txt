TEHRAN - Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, chairman of the Expediency Council, said on Tuesday that the government should resolve inflation, recession and unemployment. “The government has recently decided to use double-edged sword of liquidity to boost production,” he said during a meeting some members of the Union of Islamic Iran People Party. He said that it is essential to use “the people’s capabilities” and strengthening the private sector in order to improve the economy. He also said that poverty disturbs “social peace” in the society and spreads “social harms”. Elsewhere, Rafsanjani described interaction among the political groups as “good.” NA     All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
