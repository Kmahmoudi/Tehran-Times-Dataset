TEHRAN – The nuclear agreement is a valuable asset for peace and security in the region, Hesamoddin Ashna, a senior cultural advisor to the president, said on Monday. “Barjam (Farsi acronym for the deal) managed to disprove the accusation that Iran had been trying to attain nuclear weapons,” Ashna said, IRNA reported. He emphasized that Iran’s peace-making efforts are not restricted to the nuclear pact, pointing to Tehran’s efforts that prevented the collapse and disintegration of Syria. Iran does not tolerate the overthrow of regional political systems through violence and foreign intervention, he added.
