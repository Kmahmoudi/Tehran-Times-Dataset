The bills have been drawn up within the framework of the sixth five-year national development plan (2017-2021), Mehr news agency reported. SEA is a systematic decision support process, aiming to ensure that environmental and possibly other sustainability aspects are considered effectively in policy, plan and program making, while EIA is the assessment of the environmental consequences of a plan, policy, program, or concrete projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action by individuals or companies in all aspects of the projects run by the private or the public sector. Within the laws restoration programs pertaining to endangered wetlands particularly those listed among Ramsar wetlands of international importance under Ramsar Convention must be carried out so that by the end of the program at least some 20 percent of them will be revived and step along the road to recovery. Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. The administration is additionally required to finance environmental projects both domestic ones and international ones. The law has also tasked the administration with monitoring waste management projects in beaches, marine environments, forests, and plains and succeeding in treatment of at least 20 percent of the waste with proper waste disposal methods per annum.
