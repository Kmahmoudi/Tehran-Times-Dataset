Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, has said that the West exerted pressures on Iran in order to isolate it but their efforts in this regard backfired. He described making progress under economic siege and the most severe pressures possible as indicative of the Iranian nation’s bright performance. “The U.S. said the economic pressures they've put on Iran are unprecedented in history. Despite all their lies, they were true to this,” the Leader added.

He named the Persian New Year the year of "Inflation Control, and Growth in Production."
