TEHRAN – Javad Jahangirzadeh, the Iranian ambassador to Baku, met with Speaker of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan Ogtay Asadov on Thursday inviting him to the Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States summit.
 The PUOICM summit is scheduled to be held in Tehran on January 15.  The meeting will take place as U.S. President Donald Trump on December 6 declared al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel and ordered the State Department to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds. To counter Trump’s move, the Iranian parliament voted on Wednesday to recognize al-Quds as the capital of Palestine. The vote, passed 207-0 in the 290-member Majlis, requires Iran to recognize al-Quds as “the everlasting capital of Palestine”. The Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States is composed of the parliaments of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation member states. It was established in Iran on June 17, 1999, with its head office in Tehran. Member states to the organization are Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros, Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau    , Guyana, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria    , Oman    , Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tajikistan, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey    , Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.  NA/PA
