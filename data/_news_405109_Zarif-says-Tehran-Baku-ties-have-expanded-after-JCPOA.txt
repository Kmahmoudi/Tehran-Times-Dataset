TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that relations between Iran and Azerbaijan started growing both during the nuclear talks and after the conclusion of the nuclear pact, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 In an interview with Trend news agency published on Monday, Zarif said compared to the other neighboring countries, the pace of Iran’s growing relationship with Azerbaijan and Russia is notable. “Under the sanctions, Iran’s relations with neighbors were affected less than with others. However, with the onset of the nuclear talks, Iran’s neighbors also took a more active approach toward Iran,” he said. Zarif also praised Azerbaijan and Russia’s positive approach towards the nuclear deal. Thanks to the JCPOA, the three counties can now enjoy expansion of cooperation, while under the sanctions there were many problems for Iran, especially cooperation in energy and transit sectors, the foreign minister remarked. Foreign Minister Zarif was in Baku, accompanying President Hassan Rouhani who took a trip to Azerbaijan to participate in a trilateral summit with Russian and Azeri presidents.
