Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Yukio Amano has reiterated that Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 “We have continued to verify and monitor the implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA. It is essential that Iran continues to fully implement those commitments,” he said in his statement to the 73rd Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly. He added, “The Agency continues to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material declared by Iran under its Safeguards Agreement.” Under the 2015 nuclear agreement Iran was obliged to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions, however, U.S. President Donald Trump officially withdrew Washington from the nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions on Iran.  The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were announced on November 4. It is more than 10 times that the IAEA is confirming that Iran is abiding by the terms of the nuclear agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council resolution 2231.
