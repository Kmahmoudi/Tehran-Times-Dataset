TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Saturday that Iran welcomes stability and security in Armenia. “For the Islamic Republic of Iran, its neighbors and their peace, stability and security have always been the top priority,” Qassemi said on Saturday, Press TV reported. He also lauded the Armenian parliament's election of a new prime minister for the country, which was hit by weeks of protests. Armenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan won the parliament's backing on May 8 to take over as the country's prime minister, ending weeks of mass protests in the ex-Soviet republic.
