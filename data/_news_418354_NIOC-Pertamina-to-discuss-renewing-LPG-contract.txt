TEHRAN – The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) is due to discuss the renewal of its LPG export contract with Indonesia’s state-run Pertamina next week, Platts reported quoting a source familiar with the matter. As reported, the parties will review volumes as well as price levels for 2018 exports. Pertamina has had a contract with NIOC since May 2016 for a total 600,000 million tons (mt) of LPG to be delivered over 2016-2017 in 14 cargoes.
