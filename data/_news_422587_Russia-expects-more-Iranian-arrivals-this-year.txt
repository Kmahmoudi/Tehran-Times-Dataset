TEHRAN – Russia anticipates tourist influx from Iran to increase during the FIFA World Cup in June and July. “In 2018, we expect a significant number of both Iranian fans and Iranian tourists,” TASS quoted Oleg Safonov, the director of Russia’s Tourism Agency, as saying on Monday. “There is an intergovernmental agreement between our countries on visa-free tourist trips for groups.” Last year, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin inked a visa-free agreement for tourist groups in Moscow.
