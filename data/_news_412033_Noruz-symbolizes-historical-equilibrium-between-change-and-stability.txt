Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Jaberi Ansari believes that the Iranian nation has historically been a textbook example of ongoing adaptability to ever-changing situations in its environs. In being so, the nation, while being open to change, has never lost sight of its originality. “In sensitive historical bottlenecks, the nation has assimilated into and adapted to change and simultaneously has preserved its historical continuity and Noruz is one of the key elements of this continuous process,” he told the Tehran Times in an exclusive interview. The top Iranian diplomat also wished all Iranians and other nations who celebrate Noruz a year of prosperity and happiness. On March 20, Iran will celebrate the outset of the new Iranian calendar year 1396.    In what follows, a full transcript of the interview is given: First of all, I deem it necessary to congratulate the coming of ancient, auspicious Noruz to the Iranian nation and all other nations which are geographically within the ancient and cultural sphere of Noruz. The Iranian nation has always embraced change yet has preserved its history and authenticity, and this is the reason why the country has been dynamic and enduring over its long history. Also, perhaps that’s why the nation, despite all crises and hardships over the past two or three decades, is now a progressive power in the region in the eye of outsiders. This, in turn, is the outcome of historical bonds of the nation to its civilization and culture.  In sensitive historical bottlenecks, the nation has assimilated into and adapted to change, and simultaneously has preserved its historical continuity and Noruz is one of the key elements of this continuous process. This means Noruz is not a quality intrinsic to a certain historical era. The long history of the Iranian nation and the geography represents the cultural and the richness of our country’s civilization. Noruz, in a sense, connects the nations with similar cultural and civilization backgrounds. The fact that the Iranian New Year is celebrated and coincides with the start of spring is one of the greatest beauties of the Iranian culture and civilization. And this is the most natural time for the New Year. Noruz symbolizes an original, long-standing mix of stability and change in the sweep of history as well as openness in the face of ongoing adjustment. I seize the opportunity to wish a year of success, happiness, and continuous progress for the Iranian nation. I also wish that the New Year will be a year of serenity and restoration of stability and security in the region.
