TEHRAN – Mohammad Salas, a dervish cult sympathizer who recently drove a bus into police ranks and killed three of them in Tehran, is expected to stand trial on Sunday, the Fars news agency reported. The incident happened during last month’s unrest in the Pasdaran neighborhood, where a group of Gonabadi dervishes held an unauthorized gathering near a police station and engaged in clashes with police. Two members of the Basij volunteer force also lost their lives in separate car-ramming and stabbing attacks at the site.
