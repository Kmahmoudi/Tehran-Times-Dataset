TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has said that Saudi Arabia is seeking to fuel crises in the Middle East region in order to find a way out of quagmires it has created for itself.
 “In order to find a gateway Saudi Arabia’s objective is to involve others in its own problems through heightening tension in the region,” Qassemi said in an interview with IRIB published on Tuesday. Following consecutive defeats in the region especially in the Yemeni war, Saudis are taking new actions to involve others in the crisis, he noted. Qassemi also said the claim of shooting at a U.S. warship from Yemen can be a plot hatched by the Saudis and some U.S. circles to involve Washington in a “direct fight” against the Yemeni people including Ansarullah. He urged the U.S. government to be aware of the fact that, from “strategic” point of view, the Yemeni status is “highly sensitive” and it is important to maintain stability in the country. A U.S. involvement in the Yemeni war will be “dangerous” and “harmful” act. “I advise the U.S. politicians to observe the issues with a precise and realistic view and be careful about the traps that others set in the region and learn from the experiences gained over the past 30 years in Iraq, Syria and other countries,” he said. Qassemi also said that the Lausanne talks on Syria were “unsuccessful”, adding there are many contradictory views on Syria. Foreign ministers from Russia, the U.S., Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan, and Egypt as well as UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura held four hours of talks on the Syrian conflict in the Swiss city of Lausanne on Saturday.
