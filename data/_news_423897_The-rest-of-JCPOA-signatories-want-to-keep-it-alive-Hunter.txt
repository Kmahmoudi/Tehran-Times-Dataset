TEHRAN - Shireen Tahmaasb Hunter, a professor of political science at Georgetown University, tells to Tehran Times that “The rest of the signatories to the JCPOA want to keep it alive.”  Professor Hunter also says that “But there is not much they can do about it, without jeopardizing their own economic interests.” She also adds that “European countries are unlikely to endanger their relations with America for Iran's sake.” Following is the text the interview: Q: The U.S. violated the JCPOA. What are the reasons behind this unilateral revocation? A: There are several reasons for Trump's decision: First, he was form the beginning opposed to the nuclear deal; second, he wants to undo Obama's legacy; third, Trumps is close to hardline Israelis and their American supporters; Fourth, he wanted to please the Israelis and the Saudis; Fifth, many of Trump's new appointees support a hard policy vis a vis Iran. They want to exacerbate Iran's economic and hence social problems and prepare the way for a regime change, either with or without military intervention. Q: In regard to Trump's violation of the Iran deal, what are the obligations and responsibilities of the deal's other signatories? A: The rest of the signatories to the JCPOA want to keep it alive. But there is not much they can do about it, without jeopardizing their own economic interests. The fact is that, Iran is not economically or politically so important for them that they would run any significant risk for its sake. Q: In a tactful reaction to Trump's Betrayal of Nuclear Deal, Iran said the survival of JCPOA highly depends on firm European guarantees. Since the EU's leverage is not strong enough to bring the US back to reason, shall Iran count on their guarantees? A: European countries are unlikely to endanger their relations with America for Iran's sake. Moreover, as free market economies, European states cannot force their businesses to do work for Iran. The latter will make its decision on calculations of cost-benefits of doing business with Iran. Q: Will EU dare to invest or have economic engagement with Iran in a situation where the US nuclear related sanctions are back again and the foreign companies face US penalties? A: According to reports, the pre JCPOA sanctions will return. These include a wide range including the purchase of Iran's oil and banking operations. By undermining Iran's economy and its social cohesion all these sanctions undermine Iran's vital interests. Iran's options are limited. leaving the JCPOA will only increase pressure on Iran and would increase the risk of military attack. Iran should take these risks very seriously.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
