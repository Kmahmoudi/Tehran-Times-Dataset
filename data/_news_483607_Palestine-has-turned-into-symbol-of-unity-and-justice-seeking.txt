TEHRN – On Thursday, one day ahead of International Quds Day, the Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Palestine has now turned into a symbol of unity in the Islamic world and a symbol for seeking justice by all the oppressed and freedom seekers around the world with different races and religions. The last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan has been declared as Quds Day by the late Imam Khomeini. In this year’s Quds Day more than any other time hundreds of millions of justice seekers and liberal-minded people around the world loudly will cray out against the injustice against the Palestinians and what is going on in the occupied lands, the ministry said. Marchers on Quds Day will demand liberation of Palestine as the first issue of the Islamic world, the ministry said, adding for them Palestine represents the “most concrete example” in the world in which the rights of its people are violated and there is no room for international rules and regulations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said while “Zionist terrorists” have martyred about 100 Palestinians, including children and women, in the first three months of the current years, the self-proclaimed defenders of human rights in the West and supporters of the Zionist usurper regime, including the U.S. and a number of European countries, have turned into supporters of terrorism through their silence in the face of such crimes. Referring to the recent raid on the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in recent days, the ministry said the military forces from the provisional Zionist regime desecrated al-Aqsa Mosque as the first qibla of the world’s Muslims and violently attacked worshippers. In fact, the ministry said, the Zionists once again demonstrated the vicious nature of their apartheid regime before of the eyes of the people in the world. The continued moves of the usurper Zionist regime for its open and systematic violation of the Palestinians’ basic rights have made it urgently essential to liberate all occupied Palestinian lands and establish a united Palestinian government with al-Quds as its capital, the ministry said in its statement. On the eve of Quds Day (April 14) the Foreign Ministry insists on the principled and unwavering policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in backing the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian nations in their struggle for liberating stolen lands and calls on all Muslim governments and freedom seekers in the world to effectively counter the criminal Zionist regime as the “cancerous tumor and disruptor of stability and security” in the region and the world.
