TEHRAN – Iran’s historical city of Meybod plans to hold a festival on February 16 with the goal of highlighting traditional floor covering Zilou. “We should demonstrate our full potential to lay the ground for bringing rising prosperity to the Zilou weaving arena,” a local official said in a briefing session on Saturday, CHTN reported. Last October, the oasis city was designated for being a world city for Zilou by assessors from the World Crafts Council-Asia Pacific Region (WCC-APR). Iran’s handicrafts exports reached $107 million in the first half of the current Iranian calendar year (started March 21, 2018), showing 9.5 percent growth year on year. Traditional ceramics, pottery vessels, handwoven cloths as well as personal ornamentations with precious and semi-precious gemstones are among Iranian exports to Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany, the U.S., the UK and other countries.
