TEHRAN – Tehran Friday prayer leader Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami says Europeans is the same as the U.S. in violating the nuclear deal, advising Iranian officials not to trust Europe after the U.S. withdrawal from the pact. “If we say no to America but yes to Europe, it is inconsistent with lessons learned from our experiences because the European Union has been nothing better than America in not being abiding by the agreement,” Mehr quoted Khatami as saying. “This issue had some lessons for us, including that we should not trust our enemies,” he added.
