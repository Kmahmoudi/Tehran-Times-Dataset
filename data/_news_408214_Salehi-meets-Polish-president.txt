TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), met on Thursday with Polish President Andrzej Duda.
 During the meeting, Salehi expressed hope for developing cooperation between Iran and Poland on peaceful employment of nuclear energy. President Duda also hailed Salehi’s visit to Warsaw and voiced his country’s willingness to develop ties with Iran, so that the two countries can expand political, economic and cultural relations.  Salehi arrived in Warsaw on Monday to discuss possible nuclear cooperation with the East European country and also to pave the way for bilateral ties. Salehi also paid a visit to the country’s national center for nuclear research and discussed possibilities of cooperation in production of radiomedicine as well as carrying out research in this field. The Polish nuclear center also produces high-temperature reactor (HTR). Heading a nuclear entourage to Poland, he also met with Polish First Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Tadeusz Glinski. During the meeting, both sides emphasized that trade and cultural relations should be boosted. Iran has been trying to develop stronger nuclear and economic ties with foreign countries after it signed a nuclear agreement with six world powers including Russia, China, France, Britain, the U.S. and Germany. The nuclear deal, also called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), went into effect in January as was planned, in order to resolve a long running dispute over Iran’s peaceful nuclear program. The deal ended decades of economic sanctions that were imposed on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. MH/PA
