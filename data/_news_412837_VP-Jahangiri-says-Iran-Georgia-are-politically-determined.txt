TEHRAN – Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri said on Saturday that top Iranian and Georgian officials have the “political determination” to expand relations.
 Jahangiri made the remarks in a joint press conference with Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili in Tehran. The vice president called the prime minister’s visit to Tehran a “turning point” in relations. He also said the two countries share many commonalities and have common stance on many international issues. “There is a good ground for the two countries to expand economic, political and cultural cooperation,” Jahangiri said. Iran has already expressed it readiness to connect the Persian Gulf to the Black Sea through the North-South Corridor, which would connect Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran on its path. The vice president also said big countries such as China and India are willing to use the Persian Gulf-Black Sea corridor as a substitute route. “The most important issue is the issue of North-South corridor and connection of the Persian Gulf to the Black Sea through Iran-Armenia-Georgia or Iran-Azerbaijan-Georgia,” the vice president explained. Kvirikashvili also said that Georgia is ready to remove obstacles to expansion of relations with Iran and take step to increase economic cooperation. The Iranian and Georgian officials also signed four memorandums of understanding in the areas of sports, agriculture, communications, and tourism. Kvirikashvili’s trip to Iran came three days after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s visit to Georgia. The prime minister also said Iran’s private sector can export its goods to Europe through Georgia   NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
