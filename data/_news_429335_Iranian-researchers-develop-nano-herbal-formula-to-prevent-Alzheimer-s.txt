TEHRAN - Iranian researchers have developed the formulation of an herbal medicine for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, ISNA reported on Friday.
The drug’s structure is based on nanotechnology and is released inside the brain as it can sneak through blood–brain barrier.  Dementia is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behavior and the ability to perform everyday activities and Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. The new drug, however, is an herbal supplement which can easily go through the blood-brain barrier as it contains nanoparticles as well as the extract of Damask rose.According to the latest report released by Alzheimer’s disease International, someone develops dementia every three seconds; worldwide, 11 percent of people over 65 and 50 percent of people over 85 get Alzheimer’s disease. There are around 6,000 people with Alzheimer’s in the country, said head of Iran Alzheimer’s Association, Moloud Jalili Shah-Mansouri, who worked as an expert in the new drug’s research team.  “Only two groups of drugs are approved to have benefits for Alzheimer’s patients and they can only slow down the disease’s progress. Furthermore, they bring about unpleasant side effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, headache, fatigue and loss of appetite. Above all, getting past the blood-brain barrier is their biggest challenge,” said the Alzheimer expert.  “The new drug, however, is an herbal supplement which can easily go through the blood-brain barrier as it contains nanoparticles as well as the extract of Damask rose.”  “The Damask rose extracts can accelerate the development of some proteins that contribute to neuron production; it also help inhibit the activities of Acetylcholinesterase enzyme and boosts the choline esters that function as neurotransmitters. Besides, it reduces the neuron’s inflammation by easing the brain’s oxidative stress.” “The drug should be prescribed at the onset or primary stages of the disease as it also has preventive effects, and can also be prescribed for healthy old people.”  “In coming years, we will face the crisis of old-age diseases such as Alzheimer’s and dementia, so taking measures to prevent such diseases is of great importance.”  The expert said the new drug would have a large market demand as it is an herbal supplement which can target different age groups as a memory and concentration booster.  SJ/MG   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
