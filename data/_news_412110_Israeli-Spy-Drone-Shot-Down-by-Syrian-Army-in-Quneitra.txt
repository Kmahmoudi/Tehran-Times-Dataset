TEHRAN - The Syrian army's air defense units shot down a spy drone belonging to the Israeli regime at midnight Monday after violating Syria's airspace in the Southern parts of the Southwestern province of Quneitra. According to a statement released by the Syrian military, the Skylark reconnaissance drone was shot down over Samadaniyah Sharqiah, near the border town of al-Quneitra. The Israeli army also confirmed that one of their reconnaissance drones has been shot down by the Syrian army in the late hours of Monday. General Command of the Syrian Armed Forces said in a statement on Friday that the Syrian air defense shot down an Israeli warplane and hit another one after four aircraft breached the war-torn country's airspace.  "4 Israeli enemy aircraft penetrated our airspace at 2:40, this morning in the al-Bareij area across the Lebanese territory and targeted the military positions on the direction of Palmyra city East of Homs province," the armed forces' statement said, adding, "Our air defense system engaged and shot down an air plane in the occupied territories and hit another and forced the rest to flee." "This desperate attempt and blatant aggression of the Zionist enemy, was a move to support terrorist group and raising their morale, and the disruption of the Syrian Arab Army victories in the face of terrorist organizations," the statement added. "General Command of the Armed Forces affirms its determination to counter any attempt of the Zionist aggression on any part of the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic," the statement underscored. Earlier on Friday, the Israeli military told Sputnik that its combat planes were targeted by missiles after they had attacked targets in Syria. However, the incident allegedly did not result in any damages or casualties on the Israeli side, according to the source.
