TEHRAN- With the newly-designed advanced long-range drone rolling out, Iran is capable of targeting Tel Aviv and Haifa inside Israel, Commander of the Iranian Army's Ground Force announced on Sunday night. Speaking with national TV in a special program, Brigadier General Kiomars Heidari touched upon some remarks surrounding Iran’s military might to take the grip on the Israeli cities in the event of the miscalculation of Iran’s archenemy. Tel Aviv and Haifa were "particularly" considered while the "Arash-2" was being constructed, according to Commander Heidari. "We are waiting for orders to deploy it one day," he continued. "The drone has special characteristics and can recover several times till it strikes its objective.” Heidari added, "We will reveal its capabilities in future drills."  The brigadier general emphasized that it is "a unique bird built for this mission" and that "this drone has reached the ground troops." On the other hand, he said, the Army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) are viewed as “a heavenly army". "Tel Aviv and Haifa were particularly considered while the 'Arash-2' was being constructed" The commander noted that "the Army's ground troops are the best and are unsurpassed among the countries of the region."  Army ground personnel are currently at the heart of the drone program, Heidari pointed out. "Of course, we also have drones with a lesser range in our combat organization," he added. "We have drones with a strategic range and even one with a range of 2,000 kilometers." The opponents must be warned that if they commit a mistake, “we will use equipment and weapons that were produced locally in order to break their limbs and legs.”  Heidari also said, “We won't allow them to get the upper hand and we'll always retain supremacy.” The announcement came as David Barnea, the head of the Israeli regime's spy agency Mossad, said on Monday that Iran would not be granted "immunity" even if the United States re-entered the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal. “Even if a nuclear deal is signed it will not give Iran immunity from the Mossad operations,” Barnea said. “We won’t take part in this charade and we don’t close our eyes to the proven truth.” He then openly threatened Iran militarily, saying, “The Iranian leadership must be aware that the use of force against Israel or against Israelis will be met with a painful reaction on Iranian soil.  We will chase after the ones who sent those affiliates. It will happen in Tehran or Isfahan.” Responding to this open and direct threat, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry Nasser Kanaani told the Tehran Times correspondent on Monday, “We do not expect a terrorist regime to do anything other than terrorist actions.” Barnea's latest threat came on the same day that the regime’s caretaker Prime Minister, Yair Lapid, landed in Germany to encourage its Western partner to abandon the Iran nuclear deal. Last week, the Mossad director traveled to Washington to meet his American counterpart William Burns, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The regime has been actively campaigning against the resurrection of the JCPOA, and evidently the E3 countries (Britain, France and Germany) are falling for this deceit. In a joint presser with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday, Lapid said, “Returning to the nuclear agreement under current conditions would be a mistake.” Scholz also followed the same line of thought, accusing Iran of halting the negotiations, expressing regret that Iran has not yet responded positively. “It does not seem that there will be a signing of the agreement in the near future, because of Iran.” In this regard, Kanaani told the press on Monday that he expects the E3 countries to “act constructively.” “Our advice to the European partners of the Vienna talks is to take a constructive path and make amends for the past mistakes and try to pave the way for an agreement in a constructive and comprehensive way,” he pointed out.
