Last week, one of British networks had a discussion with three Britons regarding ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ vote to stay in the European Union, better known as Brexit. The comments of one of the participants revolved on the outcomes that the EU had for Britain as an EU member state and not the quality of the membership. But the other two mainly focused on the quality and the advantages of EU membership for London and were keen to stay in the European Union. Subconsciously, I realized that the emotional aspect of the pro-EU membership discussion was forced on the logic of it. However, now that 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the EU, Europe is shocked that suddenly the balance went in favor of the emotional aspect versus logic. The opposition insists that in the new situation, new opportunities will arise for Britain and the way will be paved for its development. They believe that the freedom of British people to vote and decide for more effective policies as well as a decrease of Britain’s commitments and responsibilities regarding the crises plaguing countries in Europe will bring them back the EU membership fee.  Despite the right or wrong side of the decision to leave the EU, it seems that the early economic signals has made economic analysts to think the majority vote to leave the EU was a catastrophe, at least for the British economy.
Therefore one should be hopeful that the decision will be fruitful in political domain and worth the scratch. One of the first outcomes was the reaction of the Scotts. The little majority of keeping Britain and Scotland integrated had proven that the logic behind the vote won over the emotional aspect and the negative consequences were avoided even amid the ethnic tendencies. This means that the British should pin their hope on a lavish and colorful economy to keep all parties satisfied. This is while most Scottish people had voted in favor of staying in the European Union to take advantage of it; however now they have lost their motive and desire to be integrated with Britain. The development follows as even some Britons find it interesting to have an Irish identity. In this case the threat of separatists to have another referendum is really a serious threat and most analysts share the same view that with no doubt they will be the winner of any kind of referendum.  No one can give an appropriate and good explanation or interpretation of the recent political act of the British people, who consider themselves as the men of logic among all, and the mind of each analyst or expert wanders around sociological reasons behind the move. However one thing is almost absolute that no one can be optimistic regarding the British political and economic domain, at least in mid-term period.
