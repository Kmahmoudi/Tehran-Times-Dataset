TEHRAN – Iranian author Fariba Jafarzadeh has worked on translating a selection of stories by German folklorists and linguists the Brothers Grimm. The Brothers Grimm are best known for “Kinder- und Hausmarchen” (Children’s and Household Tales) also called “Grimm’s Fairy Tales” which led to the birth of the modern study of folklore.  “Most of the stories by the two brothers are rooted in French folk literature. The stories are quite simple with very familiar concepts,” Jafarzadeh told the Persian service of ISNA in remarks published on Friday. She added that the book “Stories and Tales of French People” will contain 18 stories of French origin dating back to the 4th and 16th centuries translated into Persian from French. The book is due to be published by Zekr Publications, Jafarzadeh said, adding that she hopes the book will be available at the Tehran International Book Fair (TIBF), which will be held in May. Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm (1785-1863) and Wilhelm Carl Grimm (1786-1859, Berlin) together compiled other collections of folk music and folk literature, and Jacob in particular did important work in historical linguistics and Germanic philology, which included the formulation of Grimm’s law. They were among the most important German scholars of their time. RM/YAW All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
