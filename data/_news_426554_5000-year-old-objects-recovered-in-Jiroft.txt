TEHRAN – Iranian authorities have recently recovered three objects estimated to date from 5,000 years ago, IRNA reported on Tuesday. The relics were discovered in Jiroft, an ancient city in southeastern province of Kerman, the report said without providing further details. Back in 2008, Piotr Steinkeller, professor of Assyriology in Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations of Harvard University, announced that Jiroft is the lost ancient city of Marhashi. Steinkeller presented his theory during the first round of an international conference on Jiroft civilization, held in Tehran on May 5 and 6, 2008.  Marhashi, (known in earlier sources as Warahshe) was a 3rd millennium BC polity, which was formed east of Elam on the Iranian plateau. A great number of national and international archaeologists and scholars discussed latest studies on the Jiroft civilization during the second leg of the conference, which ran in Jiroft on May 8-9 of the same year.
