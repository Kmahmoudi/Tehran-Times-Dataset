TEHRAN – Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said on Monday that Iran would advance its nuclear program if Washington decides to withdraw from the nuclear agreement. In a meeting with France’s Special Envoy to Syria Franck Gellet, Boroujerdi said in such case “the world will see that Iran’s nuclear ability is stronger than what it was before the nuclear accord.” He also stressed Iran’s commitment to the NPT and the fatwa (religious decree) issued by the Leader in which he has declared production, use and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction as haram (banned).
