TEHRAN – Isfahan authorities are seeking a wider tourism scene for the ancient city, which was once the seat of power in Persia and a top tourism destination now. Isfahan, central  Iran, embraces a wide variety of historical places some of which have mainly been off the radar of foreign travelers for some reason. Fereydoun Allahyari, Isfahan province’s tourism chief, seeks to make a balance of tourist flow between downtown Isfahan and its other less-touched neighborhoods, Mehr reported on Thursday. “Over the past couple of years, tourism industry has mainly been expanded around historical districts of downtown Isfahan, therefore we are adopting new plans to define new tourism axes …, a bid for balanced tourism development in all districts of the metropolis,” Allahyari explained. As a recent move, Isfahan’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Department in collaboration with Isfahan Municipality decided to turn a vast historical bathhouse into a hub for international travelers, after being fully restored and came equipped with modern amenities. The historical bathhouse is located in Rehnan District in west Isfahan. It dates from the Safavid era (1501–1736). During its heyday, it was departed to two sections, the bigger one dedicated to men and the smaller to women. Isfahan is one of the top tourist destinations in the country. A record number of some 85 thousand foreign travelers set foot in Isfahan during the first Iranian calendar month of Farvardin (Mar. 21 to Apr. 20), setting a new record for the past 40 years. Profusion of tree-lined boulevards, abundant Persian gardens and important Islamic buildings give Isfahan an unmatched visual appeal while its ubiquitous artisans underpin its reputation as a living museum of traditional culture.
