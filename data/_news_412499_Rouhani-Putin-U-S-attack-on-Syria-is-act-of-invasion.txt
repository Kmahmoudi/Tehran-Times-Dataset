TEHRAN – Hassan Rouhani and Vladimir Putin, the Iranian and Russian presidents, said on Sunday that U.S. airstrike against Syria was an act of invasion which ran contrary to international law and the UN charter.
 In a phone conversation, the two senior officials described the U.S. attacks as a “support” for terrorists. On Friday, the U.S. launched cruise missiles at the Shayrat airfield from which President Donald Trump claimed a chemical weapons attack had been launched. The suspected chemical attack in the northern Syrian province of Idlib on Tuesday left at least 80 people killed and hundreds injured.  Russia had said the chemical attack was caused when rebel chemical munitions workshops were hit by a Syrian airstrike.   “We condemn the U.S. missile attacks on Syria and consider it a clear violation of a country’s sovereignty. It is essential to study and condemn this unilateral action in the UN Security Council,” Rouhani said in his conversation with Putin. Rouhani also condemned use of chemical weapons in Syria, saying it was “regrettable”.  The terrorists have access to the chemical weapons and the U.S. missile attacks will lead to use of such weapons again, the Iranian president predicted. Rouhani added the U.S. attack was in line with policy to strengthen the terrorists. He also reiterated Tehran’s position that the crisis in Syria must be settled politically. “The recent U.S. attack will create a division among the countries in fighting terrorism and will divert the political talks to military solution. In such atmosphere, boosting cooperation among Iran, Russia and Syria in countering violence and terrorism is essential,” the president remarked. Putin said that the U.S. missile attacks were an “unacceptable move” which strengthens the terrorists. The Russian leader also said the U.S. attack was a “show” and a “preplanned action”. He said that the attack will not help settle the crisis in Syria. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
