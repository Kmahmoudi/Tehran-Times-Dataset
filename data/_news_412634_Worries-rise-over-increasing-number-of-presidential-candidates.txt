TEHRAN – Worries are rising over the large number of people who have registered for Iran’s presidential race this year.
 Ali Asqar Yusefnejad, a member of the Majlis presiding board, expressed pity over the situation, calling on the lawmakers to think a mechanism to prevent such occurrences in the future, ISNA reported on Saturday. Also, Iran’s Ambassador to London Hamid Baidinejad wrote on Instagram that “It does not seem the present way of registering candidates befits the global prestige of our country.” SP/PA
