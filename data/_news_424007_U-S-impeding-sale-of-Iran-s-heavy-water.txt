TEHRAN - Behrooz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, has said that the U.S. is impeding purchase of Iran’s heavy water, however, there are certain customers who do not pay attention to the U.S.
 “We sold a part of extra amount of heavy water and we have good customers. The U.S. have told certain customers to avoid purchasing our heavy water, however, there are buyers who do not pay attention to the U.S.,” Kamalvandi told Fars news agency in an interview published on Sunday.  “Market of the heavy water in the world is important for us whether the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] exists or not. We can provide our need and sell extra amount,” he added. ‘Iran can resume uranium enrichment to 20% purity in 2-3 days’ Kamalvandi also said that Iran can resume enriching uranium to the purity level of 20% in matter of 2-3 days. “All the pumps, monitors and… are ready in Fordow. It is like a car with keys on it and ready to move. Enrichment to 20% can be resumed immediately in 2-3 days,” he explained.  Earlier in March, Kamalvandi said that Tehran can resume enriching uranium to the purity of 20 percent in less than a week. Nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi also said in August 2017 that Iran can resume enriching uranium to 20 percent in five days if necessary. ‘Europeans have political will to preserve JCPOA’ Kamalvandi also said that the Europeans have the political will to preserve the JCPOA after the U.S. withdrawal from the international agreement on May 8. “The Europeans have shown that they have the political will but what is important is taking practical actions. We should not forget that Europe’s interest are intertwined with the U.S. and they should have close ties with the U.S., but adopting independent policies is very important,” he pointed out. After the U.S. withdrawal, Iran wants assurances from the remaining parties - especially the European Union trio of Germany, Britain and France - that its interests are guaranteed or it will resume its nuclear activities with a greater speed.
