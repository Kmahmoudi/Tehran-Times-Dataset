TEHRAN — After 14 years of research and 8 years of clinical experiments, a drug for treatment of migraine was produced in Iran. The newly developed drug called “Migrie Heal” is a combination of Iranian traditional medicines with modern medicine and pharmacology, Tasnim news agency quoted the drug project researcher Saleh Ramezani as saying on Tuesday. He further mentioned the 95 percent successfulness of the drug, noting that the drug can lead to less currency flow out of the country. He went on to say that so far all the so-called drugs prescribed for treatment of migraine are merely pain killers but “Migrie Heal” is believed to be a certain cure which guarantees that the excruciating headaches would never come back again. The painkillers mostly come with side effects while the new drug has almost no side effects and is approved by the Health Ministry toxicology lab, he pointed. A research team comprising of researchers at Tehran, Iran and Gilan universities of medical sciences collaborated on the project, Ramezani added. Over the experiments the patients’ status were both checked before and after administrating the drug to validate its effectiveness, he explained. Checking up on the patients’ status after having stopped taking the drug over a 6-month period indicated that the number of the migraine attacks were reduced by more than half, he highlighted, adding, it also helped in decreasing the severity of the pain as well as its frequency. The 120-day trial costs some 4.5 million rials (nearly $130) and compared to the painkillers which cost $12 each is pretty cost-efficient, he stated.
