TEHRAN – Representatives of 51 Muslim countries gathered in Mashhad on Tuesday to celebrate the choice of the northeastern Iranian city as the Islamic Culture Capital for 2017.

 Over 100 Iranian and foreign officials attended the celebration held at the Qods Hall of the holy shrine of Imam Reza (AS).  “The choice of Mashhad as the Islamic Culture Capital for 2017 can help the voice of Muslim unity be heard in the world,” said Iran’s Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Reza Salehi-Amiri, at celebration. “There was an approach to dialogue in the teachings of Imam Reza (AS),” he mentioned and asked the Muslim countries to hang on to the affinities among the Islamic nations. Salehi-Amiri said, “Muslim nations are currently facing a common enemy and it is those who present a harsh image of the merciful religion of Islam to the world.”    The Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) selects the Capital of Islamic Culture every year for the Arab nations and the Asian and African regions. Salehi-Amiri also held meetings with three cultural officials on the sidelines of the celebration. The meetings were organized with Syrian Minister of Tourism Bishr Riyad Yazigi, Mauritanian Minister of Culture and Crafts Muhammad al-Amin Walad Sheikhuna and ISESCO Deputy Director General Amina Al Hajri. In the meeting with Yazigi, Salehi-Amiri pointed to the Syrian historical sites destroyed by ISIS and stressed Iran’s readiness to help Syria restore the sites after the terrorist groups are wiped out the country.
