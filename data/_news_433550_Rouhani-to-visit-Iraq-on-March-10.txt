TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani will pay an official visit to Iraq, starting on March 10, to strengthen trade relations while Iran has come under tough U.S. sanction, Tasnim reported on Thursday. This is Rouhani’s first official visit to Iraq, which has been organized by Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, his deputy Abbas Araqchi and central bank Governor Abdolnaser Hemmati. Rouhani will be accompanied by a high-level delegation during the visit. Former Iraqi President Fuad Masum and the current Iraqi President Barham Salih visited Tehran in 2015 and 2018, respectively.
