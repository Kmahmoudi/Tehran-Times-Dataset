TEHRAN – Italy fully endorses the continuous implementation of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, its deputy foreign minister said in Tehran on Saturday.  “Italy endorses Iran’s nuclear deal with the P5+1 countries and will contribute to its full implementation,” Vincenzo Amendola said during an appearance with his opposite number, Majid Takhravanchi.  The historic deal between Iran and six major powers restricts Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international economic and financial sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Italy was one of Iran’s leading economic and trade partners before sanctions when annual exchanges amounted to 7 billion euros compared with 1.6 billion euros now. Italy, which presides over the G7 group of rich nations, was one of the first countries to resume trade ties with Iran after the deal. 
In November 2016, its industry minister pledged to support business deals with Iran potentially worth billions of dollars, undeterred by fears U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could put slowly thawing international relations back on ice. Italy was one of Iran’s leading economic and trade partners before the sanctions time when annual exchanges amounted to 7 billion euros compared with 1.6 billion euros now, Eurostat said. On his first overseas trip since the nuclear deal came into force in January 2016, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani landed in Italy, clearing the way for Iran to rebuild its relationship with Europe.  Ever since, there has been a 50 percent hike in trade exchanges between the two countries, what Takhravanchi hailed as “successful” and “in the interest of both countries”.  In a separate meeting with Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, Amendola noted that Rome is awaiting Tehran’s thumbs-up to a memorandum of understanding on credit lines to finance finalized deals between the two sides.  AK/PA
