TEHRAN – Commander of Iranian Army’s Ground Forces Brigadier General Kioumars Heidari announced on Wednesday that the army plans to launch four production lines of necessary defense equipment and arms.
 Addressing a press conference in Tehran, General Heidari said that the ground forces will launch the production lines in the current Iranian year to meet the country’s need for military equipment and arms. He also said that the number and range of drones used during the ground forces’ operations throughout the country are increasing. “Since using drones in is a necessity for the armed forces, we have set up a drone group and we plan to equip the group with various tactics, used by the world’s advanced drone units, in the current [Iranian] year,” he said.  “We have plans to prepare the drones for night and long-range operations and increase their durability in operations," the commander added. Iranian military experts have made great achievements in recent years in manufacturing a broad range of indigenous equipment to make the country’s army self-sufficient in the arms industry. Tehran has on numerous occasions assured other countries, especially neighboring states, that its military might poses no threat to any country and that the Islamic Republic’s defense capability is merely a deterrent. In February, Iran held a three-day military exercise that showcased its military power with homegrown rockets, artillery, tanks and helicopters.
