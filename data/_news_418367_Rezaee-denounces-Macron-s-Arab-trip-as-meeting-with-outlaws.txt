TEHRAN – Iran Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezaee has expressed concern over French President Emmanuel Macron’s trip to Arab countries, urging him to tell “his friends” in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to end their massacre of Yemeni people. “As a member of the United Nations Security Council, France is supposed not to support the world’s outlaws,” Rezaee tweeted on Friday, referring to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Macron earlier spoke in unison with Saudi Arabia in accusing Iran for a recent missile attack on Riyadh by Yemen’s Houthis.
