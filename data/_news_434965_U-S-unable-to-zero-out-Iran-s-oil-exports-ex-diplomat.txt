TEHRAN – A former Foreign Ministry spokesman believes that the United States is not capable of forcing Iranian oil exports to zero. In an interview with the Arman newspaper published on Monday, Ramin Mehmanparast said the global energy market has certain restrictions and removing Iran from the market is practically impossible. “Everyone is well-aware that if it was possible for the Americans to drive Iran’s oil exports to zero, they would have done so in the previous years,” Mehmanparast argued. He added that the U.S. is merely waging a psychological war against the Iranian nation through such declarations.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
