The Houthi rebel group in Yemen said on Sunday it fired a cruise missile towards a nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, according to i24news.tv.
 The group made the claim via its television service’s website without providing any evidence. “The missile force announces the launching of a winged cruise missile...toward the al-Barakah nuclear reactor in Abu Dhabi,” a statement carried by the Houthi-linked Al Masirah website said. The group said the missile launch came after air strikes on rebel-held territory by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, of which the UAE is a part. The Saudi-led Arab military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to support President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi after the Houthis forced him into exile. Coalition air strikes have faced repeated international criticism over civilian casualties. Yemen's Houthi rebels also fired a missile at an airport near Riyadh on November 4.
