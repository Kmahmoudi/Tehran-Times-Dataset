Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin said on Tuesday that Iran, Russia and Turkey will hold the next top-level meeting on Syria in Astana, Kazakhstan.
 “We aim to use the consultations in this format to ‘synchronize our watches’ and to consider the situation on the ground and around Syria, in order to continue our successful cooperation in the Astana format, including organization and holding of the next top-level meeting in Astana,” TASS quoted Vershinin as saying during a meeting with Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal and Iranian special envoy for Arab affairs Hossein Jaberi Ansari in Moscow. The participants of the 10th International Meeting on Syria in the Astana format, held in Sochi in July of this year, agreed to hold the next meeting in November 2018. The Astana peace talks were launched on Jan. 23-24, 2017 with the aim of putting an end to the Syrian crisis. Kazakhstan has hosted multiple rounds of talks on Syria since January 2017, backed by the three power brokers, most of which involved delegations from the Syrian government and opposition.
