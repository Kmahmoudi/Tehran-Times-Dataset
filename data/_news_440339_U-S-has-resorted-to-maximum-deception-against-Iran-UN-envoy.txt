TEHRAN - Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, has said that the United States’ campaign of “maximum deception” is in line with Washington’s policy of “maximum pressure” against Iran. “This ‘maximum deception’ campaign is in line with and a living example of the so-called ‘maximum pressure’ policy of the United States against,” he wrote in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres published by ISNA on Friday. The letter by Ambassador Takht-Ravanchi came after the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran without any substantiated evidence for the September 14 drone strikes on the Saudi Aramco oil installations claimed by the Yemenis. In a tweet on September 15, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also said that the U.S. failed policy of maximum pressure on Iran has turned into “maximum deceit”. “Having failed at ‘maximum pressure’, Secretary Pompeo is turning to ‘maximum deceit’,” Zarif tweeted. Takht-Ravanchi said in the letter that following any incident, Washington declares Iran as the culprit immediately and without any investigation and evidence. Following is full text of the letter: I would also like to reiterated that Iran has not conducted any activity inconsistent with paragraph 3 of annex B to resolution 2231 (2015), and accordingly, it is determined to resolutely continue its activities related to ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles, both of which are its inherent rights under international law and are necessary for securing its security as well as socioeconomic interests, respectively. Ambassador Takht-Ravanchi also says, Iran “is determined to resolutely continue its activities related to ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles, both of which are its inherent rights under international law and are necessary for securing its security as well as socioeconomic interests.” At the same time, since Iran’s activities related to space launch vehicles and ballistic missiles fall outside the purview or competence of resolution 2231 (2015) and its annexes, the Secretary-General is therefore expected to seriously avoid reporting on Iran’s such activities in his next reports on the implementation of that resolution. Seizing this opportunity, I would also like to categorically reject the allegations against Iran made by the Permanent Representative of the United States at the 8619th meeting of the Security Council on 16 September 2019 (S/PV.8619). It has become a standard practice of certain officials of the United States who, following any incident -- no matter where and by whom – without exception, immediately and without any investigation and evidence, declare Iran as the culprit. This “maximum deception” campaign is in line with and a living example of the so-called “maximum pressure” policy of the United States against Iran. It is evident that no amount of smear campaign, disinformation and deception against Iran can change the realities about the illegal practices and irresponsible policies of the United States or distract attention away from its destructive policies, malign behavior and destabilizing measures, in particular in the Middle East. Instead of such futile attempts and baseless allegations, the United States must stop exporting an unprecedented amount of sophisticated weaponry to the Middle East, which are used including for death and destruction in Yemen by the closest regional allies of the United States. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council.
