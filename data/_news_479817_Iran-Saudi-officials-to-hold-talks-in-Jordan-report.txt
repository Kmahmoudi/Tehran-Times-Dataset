TEHRAN - The Lebanese online newspaper, El-Nashra, has claimed that a significant meeting will take place between Iranian and Saudi officials on the sidelines of the Iraq conference that will be hosted by Jordan.  The second iteration of the Baghdad Conference for Cooperation and Partnership will take place on December 20 in Amman, Jordan, according to a report from El-Nashra. At the summit, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, and several more Arab nations are expected to attend. Some Lebanese sources have speculated that Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet on the sidelines of the conference. The announcement comes while Iranian officials have yet to confirm such a meeting. Furthermore, sources said since there were no tangible outcomes from Iran-Saudi Arabia meetings in Baghdad, no breakthrough is expected in the talks.Â  Based on the reports, the Yemen conflict and a reopening of the embassies are the main topics of debate during the meeting between Iranian and Saudi officials. The sources claim that there will be no mention of Lebanon during the discussions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. On December 20, Jordan will host the second session of the Baghdad Conference for Cooperation and Partnership, to which Iraq, Egypt, and France have already made public announcements of their participation. Fuad Hussein, the Foreign Minister of Iraq, issued an invitation to both Turkey and Iran when he announced the conference's date last week. Along with French President Emmanuel Macron, the leaders of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Kuwait, Jordan, Qatar, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates were invited to the inaugural Baghdad conference, which was held in August of last year in collaboration with Paris.
