TEHRAN â€“ Tandorostoon is the name of a celebration, which is traditionally held by people in Kerman, southeast of Iran, 40 days after the beginning of the Iranian New Year, Noruz, on April 30. The history of the celebration, which literally means happiness and health, dates back to ancient times. Kermani families, especially grandmothers gather at the foot of Shivashgan and Ghaleh-Dokhtar mountains. They cook Aash, an Iranian soup, and play music. The family also entertains with fortune telling and smoking Zaq, alum, to protect them from evil eye. Various tribes and ethnic groups who live in different parts of Iran are just like colors, which make a great painting. Iran is home to about 20 ethnic groups who live in different regions of the country. SB/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
