 TEHRAN – The Iranian foreign minister has condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's latest speech against Iran as “inane,” stressing that using threats against the Islamic Republic will prove to be ineffective. “Allegations, threats and profanity will never intimidate Iranians. Trump will eventually discover this; as every predecessor did,” Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted. “Everyone knew Trump’s friendship was for sale to the highest bidder. We now know that his geography is too,” Zarif wrote in another Tweet, referring to Trump’s using of the "Arabian Gulf” instead of the Persian Gulf in his speech. “No wonder supporters of Trump’s inane Iran speech are those bastions of democracy in the Persian Gulf: KSA, UAE and Bahrain,” he noted. “Everyone knew Trump’s friendship was for sale to the highest bidder. We now know that his geography is too,” Zarif added. Iran protests Trump’s remarks at UN Meanwhile, Iran's Ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshroo sent a statement to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to protest Washington’s long-term animosity, interventionism, and destabilizing approach against the Iranian nation since the victory of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The statement pointed to U.S. support for terrorist plots and coup attempts as well as Washington’s support for the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussain during Iraq’s imposed war on Iran in the 1980s, as other examples of the U.S. animosity against the Iranian nation. The statement pointed to the IRGC’s role in fighting Takfiri terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria and expressed regret over the U.S. efforts to portray a wrong image of Iran’s actions against terrorism in the Middle East. The Iranian UN mission pointed to Trump’s claims about Iran’s non-compliance with the JCPOA, noting, “While the IAEA, as the only authority responsible to deal with the issue, has repeatedly confirmed Iran’s commitment to its obligations under the JCPOA, it once again proves that the U.S. is not a trustworthy negotiating party.” ‘U.S. playing with terrorism’  Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani also said he had held talks with Russian officials while in Saint Petersburg about the U.S. “troublesome measures” on the JCPOA. The United States’ unilateral actions have infuriated all parties, the Iranian speaker added, slamming Washington’s policy toward the JCPOA as a disdain for all of the efforts the parties involved in the nuclear talks made to achieve the nuclear deal.
