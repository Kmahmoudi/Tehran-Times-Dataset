TEHRAN — Generation of waste in metropolis of Tehran has dropped by 1,000 tons per day in the current year (started March 21) compared to a year earlier, director general of Tehran Waste Management Organization affiliated to Tehran Municipality has said.
 Over a session on smart waste management held on Monday Reza Abdoli explained that there are 62,000 villages and 1,280 cities in the country producing 58,000 tons of waste on a daily basis and Tehran’s share in waste generation constitute 15 percent of the total number. Decreased by 1,000 tons, Tehraners now produce some 8,400 tons of waste daily, ISNA news agency quoted Abdoli as saying. Reforming consumption habits among the citizens and taking effective measures in managing waste resulted in reduction of waste production in the capital, he added. Currently per capita waste production is 500 grams in rural areas and 800 grams in urban areas, he said, adding that the amount is about one kilograms for Tehraners. Nearly some 200 to 400 cubic meters of leachate is produced in Tehran which is being managed, he added. Before manufacturing any products some factors including using recyclable packages should be taken into consideration, he concluded. Waste management is metropolises especially northern cities of the country have become a serious issue for the past few years. Unfortunately waste segregation at source is not being fully practice in the country.  Effective segregation of wastes means that less waste goes to landfill which makes it cheaper and better for people and the environment.  It is also important to segregate for public health.  In particular, hazardous wastes can cause long term health problems, so it is very important that they are disposed of correctly and safely and not mixed in with the normal waste coming out of home or office.
