TEHRAN — The average number of children born per woman has increased in Iran thanks to the implementation of proper policies, a health ministry official said on Saturday.  The figure has risen from 1.8 to 2 in the wake of population growth policies outlined by the Supreme Leader, IRNA quoted Mohammad-Esmaeil Motlaq as saying. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei outlined general policies of the country’s population plans on May 20, 2014. The Supreme Leader stressed the need for making comprehensive plans to promote the country’s economic, social and cultural situations based on the new population policies.
 
“In order to live up to the standards the number should go up to 2.1 children per woman and that’s what we are trying to achieve,” Motlaq added. Intensifying infants care particularly infants in critical condition are of the effective measures taken by the Health Ministry, he highlighted. He went on to say that other schemes set up by the ministry such as marriage initiatives to empower young couples by providing them with jobs and housing, lowering the risks of divorce by giving couple therapy, preventing premature deaths, and improving critical care in pregnancy are of the other plans to increase population. Lower marriage rate, increasing average age of first-time moms, higher divorce rate, addiction, abortion, infertility, and dysfunctional family relationships can ultimately shrink the population.
