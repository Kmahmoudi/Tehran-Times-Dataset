TEHRAN – Rudkhan Castle, called Qal’eh Rudkhan in Persian, once used to be a military fortress with an architecture partly relying on natural elements and mountainous terrain. It is situated some 25km southwest of Fuman in Gilan Province, northern Iran, where birdsong chorus and sound of tapping woodpeckers are abundant.  The historical rampart loosely constructed on top of a mount still seems comprehensive. It embraces a number of photogenic towers and somewhat calcified arches and walls that are encircled by dense forests. Most of what visitors see nowadays date back to the Seljuk-era (1037–1194) but historians estimate its original infrastructure date from the Sassanid period (224-651). Access requires a steep, sweaty but stunning minutes of walk along a streamside full of mossy rocks and pebble-studded passageways. Here is a select of comments that visitors to the historical rampart have posted to TripAdvisor, one of the most popular travel websites in the world: “So worth the climb, early is best” Although quite a hike up (about an hour on concrete steps), it is definitely worth it. Beautifully located castle walls and towers. There are toilets and free fresh drinking water at the top. We spent the night in a place close by so we could start the climb early. This proved to be a good idea as while descending, there were some minor queuing. (Majo H. from the Netherland, visited September 2016) “Worth the long walk up!” As the guide book says, it is a long, sweaty walk up to the castle. The paved path weaves its way through the deciduous woodland and so it is not until the last 300m or so that one gets to see the castle, perched atop the mountain … There are nice views from the castle across the densely wooded hills. On the way up, at the start there are a few stalls selling food and drinks, but there is nothing to buy in the castle itself so one should make sure to take enough water. (Robin R. from Belgium, visited May 2016) “Interesting castle ruins set in beautiful surrounds!” To reach the castle is a beautiful and surprisingly verdant walk up the steps. It’s uphill all the way, but not overly challenging. The view from the castle are beautiful and well worth the visit and the greenery is so different from the rest of Iran!
