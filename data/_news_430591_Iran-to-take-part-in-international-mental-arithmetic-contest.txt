TEHRAN – Iran will attend the 18th PAN PACIFIC Abacus & Mental Arithmetic Association Global Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Championships which will be held in Malaysia on December 28. 
 The Iranian team is comprised of 35 talented children, Fars reported on Tuesday. The championship is an example of what can be achieved with early intervention in abacus math and mental arithmetic education.  The purpose of the competition is to allow for the observation of mental arithmetic skills from all countries, to promote abacus and mental arithmetic education, and to improve friendships among participants from around the world. On August 2, some 323 children aged 7 to 13 years took part in the 6th national abacus and mental arithmetic contest to solve some 7 mathematical test sheets using abacuses.  “Last year, Iranian students comprising 11 students aged 5 to 12 years, ranked first among 300 students from 21 countries at the 17th PAMA Global Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Championships held on December 28 in Sandton, South Africa,” head of Smart Kids institute Rouhollah Mokhberian said. He further expressed hope to win title at the competition, and highlighted that this year, we have a greater chance of claiming medals, since selected children are more skillful than the last year’s delegation.
