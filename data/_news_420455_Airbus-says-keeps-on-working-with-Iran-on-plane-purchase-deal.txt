TEHRAN - Airbus has said it keeps on working with Iran Air and the Iranian authorities on the execution of the plane purchase agreement in full compliance with the nuclear deal requirements and other applicable regulations, AFP reported.
 Iran warned Wednesday that its multi-billion dollar deals for Airbus planes had been thrown into doubt by U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on the nuclear deal. "Considering Mr Trump's stance on pulling out of the JCPOA (nuclear deal) we must make sure that the licences will remain valid... regardless of any decision taken by U.S.," deputy transport minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told ILNA news agency. "As long as uncertainties are not resolved, we will not provide down payments," he said. "Because of these negotiations, there can be delays in payments." "In the most pessimistic case, if America wanted to pull out of the JCPOA, then it can be expected that the executive apparatus too will obey this decision."
Iran Air has so far received three Airbus planes from its 100-plane order.
