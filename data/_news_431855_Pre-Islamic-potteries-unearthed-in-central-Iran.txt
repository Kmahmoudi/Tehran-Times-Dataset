TEHRAN – A total of 22 pieces of pottery have recently been unearthed in Khaveh rural district, central Iran. The objects were found by accident during an earth excavation, IRIB reported. “The relics certainly date from pre-Islamic times but giving an exact date needs further research work,” Shahin Ilbeygi, a cultural heritage expert, said. The Muslim conquest of Persia (633–654) put an end to the mighty Sasanian Empire and is a turning point in Iranian history.
