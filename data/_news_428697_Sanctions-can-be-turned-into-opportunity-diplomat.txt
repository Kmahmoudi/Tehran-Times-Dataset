TEHRAN – Iranian Ambassador to Russia Mehdi Sanaei said on Wednesday that although sanctions have big negative effects, countries under sanctions can turn them into opportunities, IRNA reported. He also predicted that removing Iran from the world oil market could raise the oil price beyond $100 per barrel. “However, it is impossible to remove Iran from this market,” Ambassador Sanaei added. Iran’s top diplomat to Moscow also suggested that in the current situation countries such as Iran, Russia and China should rely on cooperation within the framework of regional mechanisms. He added Washington’s unilateral and warlike measures is the real cause of trouble for the world. The ambassador said Tehran has proven its goodwill with regard to the 2015 nuclear agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions. The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on August 6 and the second wave of sanctions will return on November 4. The nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was struck between Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany on July 14, 2015.
