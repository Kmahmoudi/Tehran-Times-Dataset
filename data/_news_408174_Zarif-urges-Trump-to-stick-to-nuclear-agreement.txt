TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday U.S. president-elect Donald Trump should stick to international agreements including the nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and great powers including the U.S. in July 2015.
 Zarif added, “Iran and the U.S. has no political relations, but the U.S. should implement what it has accepted under the JCPOA (the official name for the nuclear deal.” Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday and elected as the new U.S. president. Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani said on Wednesday the result of the U.S. election shows that the majority of the American people are “frustrated” and “distrustful” of the system. Shamkhani also said the U.S. election will not influence Iran’s policies. Iran’s policies, contrary to some other regional countries, have never been influenced by change of governments in the other countries, the top security official noted. Shamkhani said Iran’s policies are reliant on public support and capacities. ‘New U.S. government’s performance matters to Iran’ Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram said on Tuesday that the “performance” and “executive policies” of the new U.S. government matters to Iran. Qassemi said “serious review” is required in the U.S. policies in the Middle East. The policies adopted by the former U.S. governments and their interferences in the regional countries’ affairs are the main reasons behind the spread of violence and extremism in the Islamic countries, the ministry spokesman pointed out.
