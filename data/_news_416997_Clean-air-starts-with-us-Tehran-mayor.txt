TEHRAN -- “If we need clean air as Tehran citizens, we should start with ourselves,” Tehran Mayor Mohammad Ali Najafi said. “Citizens can walk for short distances and in this way they can do exercise as well,” he proposed. He made the remarks during his symbolic walking in central Tehran accompanied by members of Tehran City Council on the occasion of the World Car Free Day on Friday. He said that the municipality plans to develop public transportation in Tehran, however there are some financial restrictions. “The commuters at Tehran’s subway face problems during rush hours each morning and evening, so we plan to increase the number of wagons the in near future,” he explained. Najafi said that 1,000 wagons will be added soon to Tehran’s subway fleet. The Tehran metro has five active lines with nearly 200 kilometers of track carrying hundreds of thousands of passengers per day. He also explained about plans to improve bus transport services, saying that the municipality will import new buses from Hungary in the next three months. He stressed the importance of Tehran’s vehicle inspection system and its effects on air pollution monitoring.  The World Car Free Day, which is celebrated on September 22, encourages motorists to give up their cars for a day.  The event promotes improvement of mass transit, cycling and walking, and the development of communities where jobs are closer to home and where shopping is within walking distance.  SB/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
