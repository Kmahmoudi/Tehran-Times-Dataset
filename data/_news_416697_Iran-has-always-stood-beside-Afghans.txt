TEHRAN – Mahmoud Saikal, the permanent representative of Afghanistan to the UN, has said that Iran has always stood beside the Afghans in fighting terrorism.
 Iran has always played an important positive role in developments in Afghanistan, he told IRNA in an interview. “The two countries have many affinities such as language, religion and culture.
