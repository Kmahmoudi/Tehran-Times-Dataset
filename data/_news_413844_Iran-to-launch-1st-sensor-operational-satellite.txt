TEHRAN – The director of the Iran Space Research Center has announced that Iran will send a new home-made sensing-operational satellite, named “Soha”, next year.
 Elaborating on the satellite's capabilities, Hassan Haddadpour said it can detect objects with the resolution of 15m and will be deployed in the 36,000-km orbit, Fars reported on Sunday.
