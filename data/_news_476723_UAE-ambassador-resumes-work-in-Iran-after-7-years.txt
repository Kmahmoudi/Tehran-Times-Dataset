TEHRAN — The UAE ambassador to Tehran, Saif al-Zaabi, has arrived in Tehran to resume his work after 7 years, according to informed sources.
 The UAE downgraded diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016 after the attacks on the Saudi embassy in Tehran and the Saudi consulate in Mashhad in protest against Riyadh’s execution of prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
