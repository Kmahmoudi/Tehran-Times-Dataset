TEHRAN – A number of top Iranian musicians, composers and conductors are slated to hold charity concerts to raise funds for children with cancer during Barana Music Nights, which will be held from August 10 to 19 in the lavish Golestan Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in downtown Tehran.    Seven concerts are on the schedule for the event that is being organized by Barana Institute of Art in collaboration with the Mahak Charity Society, a Tehran-based major medical center for safeguarding children with cancer.  World-renowned maestro Shahrdad Rohani plans to give a piano recital of his hits for the opening night while a duet by Iranian kamancheh virtuoso Sohrab Purnazeri and Spanish flamenco guitarist Antonio Rey Navas is slated to bring the event to end.
