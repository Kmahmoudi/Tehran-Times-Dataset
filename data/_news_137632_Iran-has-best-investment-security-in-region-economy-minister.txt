Addressing participants in First Iran’s Oil Refining Forum (IORF), Davud Danesh-Jafari said that Iran attaches much more importance to investment security in its oil and industry, “And it is the safest and secure regional country for investment.” The minister also noted, the country’s 20-Year Outlook Plan has set objectives for the development of oil and gas industry, terming them as the replacement of crude and natural gas exports with exporting oil products, increase in value-added in the industry, and expansion of international cooperation on exploration and production projects. Moreover, the official continued, efforts have been made to remove obstacles to participation of the private sector in energy industry. This is in line with the implementation of the Constitution’s Article 44, he added.
