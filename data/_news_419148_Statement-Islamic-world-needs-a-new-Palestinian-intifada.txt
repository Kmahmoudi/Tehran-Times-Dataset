TEHRAN – Participants at the International Islamic Unity Conference issued a statement on Thursday saying the Islamic world needs a “new Palestinian intifada”. The statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday declared that he recognizes al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of Israel and ordered the relocation of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds. The three-day Islamic unity conference attended by around 520 dignitaries, ministers, scholars, university professors, and representatives from various associations concluded in Tehran on Thursday. “Participants at the conference highlight the necessity of confronting the new U.S. policy to Judaize the noble Quds and dominate the Muslims’ sanctities and strongly condemn this action. So, the world of Islam needs a new Palestinian intifada which is supported by all the freedom-seeking countries,” the statement reads. The statement called the Zionist regime a “cancerous tumor” that should be confronted with resistance. In response to Trump’s move, the Iranian Foreign Ministry immediately issued a statement on Wednesday denouncing the move and said it stands in stark violation of “international resolutions”. Palestinian leaders declared Friday as the “day of rage” against Israel and the U.S. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
