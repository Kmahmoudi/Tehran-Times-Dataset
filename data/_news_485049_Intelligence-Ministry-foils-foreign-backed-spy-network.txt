TEHRAN- A foreign espionage network that was gathering critical information from important authorities has been dissolved and its agents have been apprehended, according to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence. In a statement released on Tuesday, the ministry declared that continuous monitoring had shown that an unidentified foreign intelligence service had been gathering data on Iranians leaving and entering the country, including those who worked in important government positions or had access to sensitive information in sensitive institutions. In the statement, the ministry said that it had been successful in locating a network of intermediaries and executive agents who had been gathering information from a number of significant institutions and agencies inside Iran. According to the statement, the agents attempted to improperly use the databases that were accessible in Iran to extract information about travelers entering and leaving the country and then provide the information to the relevant foreign intelligence services. It further stated that once the network’s executive agents and intermediates were located within Iran, they were detained right away at the behest of the nation’s legal authorities.
