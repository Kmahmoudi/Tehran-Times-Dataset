TEHRAN – The Islamic Republic will pardon or commute prison terms of fifty thousand inmates on the fortieth anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Iran’s top judge announced on Monday. In a meeting with senior judicial officials, Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani said many of these inmates will be freed and the others’ prison terms will be commuted. Article 110 of the Constitution grants the Leader the right to pardon or reduce the sentences of convicts upon a recommendation from Judiciary chief.
