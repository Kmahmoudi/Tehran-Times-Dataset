TEHRAN - Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (known as RAI) scrapped 100 worn-out passenger wagons, IRNA reported on Monday quoting the acting head of RAI. Saeed Rasouli said the wagons were over 30 years old. As previously announced, RAI scrapped 615 worn-out passenger wagons in the past Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20, 2018). By doing so the average age of the country’s fleet of passenger wagons fell by about 10 years. RAI was planning to reduce its fleet age range to 20 years by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019). Last week, the head of Raja Rail Transportation Company said 77 new passenger wagons have been added to the country’s railway transportation fleet before the Persian New Year (Nowrouz) holiday (which starts on March 21). “Despite financial issues, in the last 27 months, over 50 new passenger cars have been purchased and added to the country’s railway fleet.” ILNA quoted Mohammad Rajabi as saying. He also mentioned the renovation of more than 67 worn wagons, saying "In addition to renovating this number of wagons, we have managed to purchase 27 second-hand passenger cars that are in excellent condition." “A total of 77 new wagons have been added to the country’s passenger railway transportation fleet.” Rajabi added. Raja is an arm of the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways which is in charge of handling passenger transportation. According to Saeed Mohammadzadeh, the previous head of RAI, development of Iranian railways requires more than 32,000 wagons and locomotives in the next four years when the railway infrastructures are developed in the country. “The national network fleet needs over 30,000 cargo wagons, 2,000 passenger wagons and 650 locomotives in the next four years.” The official says.
