TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman condemned on Monday a terrorist blast near the holy city of Karbala which left at least six people killed.
 Bahram Qassemi reiterated Iran’s full support for the Iraqi government and people in the face of terrorist acts. A suicide bomber blew himself inside a house at Ain Tamr, 50 kilometers west of Karbala, and left six people killed and six others injured. “Six suicide bombers had sneaked into al-Jihad district at Ain Tamr precinct, west of Karbala. Security forces engaged with, and killed, five of them,” Iraqi News quoted Saad Maan, the Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman, as saying on Monday. The forces encircled the sixth suicide bomber and he fled into a home and blew himself up, killing six people and wounding six others, the spokesman said. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack; however, suspicion has fallen on Daesh which has come under a heavy attack by the Iraqi forces in Mosul. The attack comes as millions of pilgrims walk to Karbala to commemorate Arbaeen. Arbaeen is a Shia Muslim religious observance that occurs 40 days after the Day of Ashura. It commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, which falls on the 10th day of the month of Muharram. NA/PA
