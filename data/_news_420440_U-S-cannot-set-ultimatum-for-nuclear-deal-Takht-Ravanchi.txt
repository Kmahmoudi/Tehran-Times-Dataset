TEHRAN – Majid Takht-Ravanchi, the deputy director of the presidential chief of staff for political affairs, says the U.S. “cannot impose conditions or set ultimatum” for the nuclear deal. The remarks came after U.S. President Donald Trump set an ultimatum to fix what he called “disastrous flaws” in the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Takht-Ravanchi said the European Union regards the JCPOA as one of its major achievements, and its support for the deal is not for economic reasons, ISNA reported on Wednesday.  The EU considers the JCPOA as a foreign policy achievement and it is politically important for them to guard the agreement, added Takht-Ravanchi who involved in nearly two years of intensive negotiations in crafting the text of the nuclear agreement.
