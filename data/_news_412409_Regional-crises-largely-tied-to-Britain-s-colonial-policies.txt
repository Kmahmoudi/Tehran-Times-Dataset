TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Wednesday that instabilities in the Middle East region is largely due to “colonial” and “expansionist” policies of Britain and its allies.
 He made the comments in response to British Prime Minister Theresa May’s remarks during her trip to Saudi Arabia. In an interview with al-Riyadh newspaper, May claimed that Iran is undermining security in the region by interfering in Arab countries’ affairs. Qassemi said, “Selling weapons to aggressors to kill innocent people in the region especially the unjust and inhuman war in Yemen do not conform to May’s claims.” He described the British prime minister’s claims as “repetitive, unfounded and illogical” and noted that it is not the first time that she makes such allegations. He also said that Iran’s efforts and determination are in line with helping establish “security, peace and stability” in the “sensitive” and “strategic” region.  “The unjust accusations of Theresa May are being made while everyone is aware of Iran’s effective role in supporting security, stability and peace of the countries that have been attacked by the terrorists and asked Iran’s help,” Qassemi added. He urged the British officials to “understand the realities” and “use their experiences in the Persian Gulf region in past decades” and take actions in “correcting their wrong position”. NA/PA
