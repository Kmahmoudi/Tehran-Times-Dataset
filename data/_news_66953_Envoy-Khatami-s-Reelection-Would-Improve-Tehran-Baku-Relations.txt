"The presidents of the two countries have a great interest in the promotion of Tehran-Baku all-out cooperation," Hasanov was quoted by the Azeri unofficial news agency, Azer Press, as saying. He also said that the Azeri government is paving the way for the future visit of President Gaidar Aliyev to Iran. On the issue of the Caspian Sea legal regime, he noted, "Since finding a final solution for the issue, which is a time-consuming one, depends on the stances of the five littoral states, it should be dealt with apart from the two countries' bilateral relations." Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are the five littoral states of the Caspian Sea.
