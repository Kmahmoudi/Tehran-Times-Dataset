TEHRAN - Christophe Eck, a senior partner at GIDE, says that the French law firm will remain active in Iran regardless of Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. Eyeing Iran for a while, after the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) initiation, the reputable French law firm decided to open a branch in Tehran. The firm already had some exposure to Iran with consulting work for Iranian cellphone service provider, Iran Cell, and advising Iran’s government around some power and energy projects. “Iran is a big country with huge potential and smart, well-educated people. We decided to take the opportunity and enter Iran market,” Eck told the Tehran Times during the Iran oil show this year. The plan came to fruition in early 2017 when Mehrnoosh Aryanpour, a perfect candidate for the job, took at the helm of the international law firm in Tehran’s office. The firm, knowing all too well that it’s tough to build a “good reputation”, took its time opening an office in Tehran, because they didn’t want to “compromise” on the quality of staff that includes renowned Iranian professor Rabia Eskini who acts as a counselor for the office in Tehran. Thus, Eck said, the employees at GIDE provide “top services for major clients with high expectations.” The firm intends to remain in Iran despite the abrogation of the Iran deal by the U.S. President Donald Trump, because GIDE won’t be directly subject to sanctions as “legal advisor” and won’t provide advice for companies on the sanction lists. However, the firm can indirectly be affected by the U.S. sanctions on Iran, because some of the clients may “reconsider”, “postpone” or “halt” their investments in Iran. The firm has stayed ahead of the game with plans to explore other countries for investment in Iran in Eastern Europe and Asia, and to stay atop the adjustments to the changes ahead in Iran. “Business needs medium and long-term visibility and stability, but with Trump’s actions, we are in a gray zone which is not very satisfactory for businesses,” Eck said.  “Trump is a business man and wants to run the U.S. like his business. History will judge whether he succeeds or not,” Eck added. Although Eck remains optimistic about the medium and long-term regarding the JCPOA. It is just the matter of wait and see to discern the ultimate fate of the Iran deal, he said.  Eck hopes the regional countries stay together and carry on political discussions. “There are challenges to meet as the need for peace is pressing.” Gide, a reputable leading international law firm operating in France and Europe, operates in 14 locations worldwide and offers consulting services in various sectors of national and international law.
