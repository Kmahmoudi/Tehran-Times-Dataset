TEHRAN – Iran’s four main Asian oil buyers increased their crude imports from the country in September to their highest level since March, boosted by a surge in purchases in China and South Korea, Reuters reported citing government and ship-tracking data. Iran’s top four Asian oil customers imported nearly 5.1 percent more oil from the country in September this year compared to the same month in 2016. The figure was reported to be 20 percent higher than that of the preceding month. China, India, South Korea and Japan imported more than 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, however the figure still remain below highs that were hit earlier this year and last year as Tehran ramped up exports following the lifting of West-imposed sanctions. Chinese imports from Iran in September rose nearly 60 percent from a year ago to about 784,000 bpd, down from August when China imported the highest monthly amount since 2006, according to data on Reuters Eikon. South Korea’s imports rose by nearly a quarter to just over 504,000 bpd, a five-month high. India’s imports fell by a third to 415,400 bpd. Imports to Japan, which announced official figures on Tuesday, were down by more than 30 percent at a bit less than 216,000 bpd.
