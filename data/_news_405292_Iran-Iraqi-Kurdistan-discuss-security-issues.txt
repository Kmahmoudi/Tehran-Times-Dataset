TEHRAN– Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Ali Shamkhani and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region’s Interior Minister Karim Sinjari held talks on a range of issues, including ways to boost cooperation on security issues. In the meeting in Tehran on Sunday morning, Shamkhani and the visiting Iraqi official from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), exchanged views about enhancing security along common borders. The two officials also discussed the security situation in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region and ways to boost cooperation between the two sides in various security areas. In an earlier meeting in Tehran with former prime minister of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, Barham Ahmad Salih, Shamkhani reaffirmed Iran’s support for unity among all Iraqi groups, including Kurds. “Increasing integrity and friendship among the Kurdish groups for active partnership in the political and economic structure of united Iraq is the Islamic Republic of Iran’s unchanging policy,” he said in that meeting on Tuesday. Iraq has been facing the growing threat of terrorism, mainly posed by the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group, which made swift advances in much of northern and western Iraq over the summer of 2014 but has been forced by the Iraqi military and volunteer forces to withdraw from many of the areas.
