TEHRAN – An exquisite Persian carpet currently being woven in the Iranian city of Tabriz is set to deliver the message of peace and friendship of the Iranian nation to people all around the world. The carpet being woven by Hamid Kazemnia under the auspices of Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization will be unveiled at the 18th General Assembly of the World Crafts Council, which will be held in the city of Isfahan from September 24 to 27. “The carpet will be complete with several symbolic knots to be tighten by high-ranking officials and attendees to the conference,” the CHTN quoted Morteza Abdar, the director of East Azarbaijan Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Department, as saying on Saturday.     Being made of pure silk, the carpet interweaves symbols of the five continents with traditional Iranian designs and patterns such as mythical birds, he added.   Last year, the World Crafts Council picked Isfahan and Tabriz as world cities of handicrafts and carpets, respectively. The non-profit organization seeks to promote fellowship and foster the economic development of member states through income-generating craft-related activities.
