TEHRAN- The value of Iran’s annual fishery export is planned to rise at least 10 percent in the current Iranian calendar year (which ends on March 20, 2019), Hassan Salehi, the head of Iran’s Fisheries Organization, announced. The official put the country’s fishery exports at 125,000 tons valued at $500 million in the past calendar year, IRNA reported. He said shrimp accounted for the main part of the exports in the past year while over 16,000 tons of shrimp valued at $100 million were exported. Salehi also said that fishery output is planned to rise 8-10 percent to 1.25 million tons in this year. He had previously put the fishery output at 1.15 million tons in the past year and the fishery consumption per capita at 11.2 kilograms, indicating 500 grams rise year on year. Infrastructures required for boosting the fishery output have been provided in the country over the past three years and related plans have been approved by domestic and foreign investors, the official said, adding, “If the banking barriers for trade with Europe are removed we will have no concern in terms of production.” MA/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
