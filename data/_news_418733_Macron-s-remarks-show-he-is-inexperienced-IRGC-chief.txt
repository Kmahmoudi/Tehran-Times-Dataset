TEHRAN – The commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said on Thursday that French President Emanuel Macron’s remarks about Iran’s missile program show that the French leader is inexperienced.
 “This issue [missile program] is different from the nuclear issue. Missile power is a defensive capability,” Mohammad Ali Jafari said in a press conference. During a visit to Dubai on November 9, Macron said he was “very concerned” by Tehran’s missile program. The French president also called for a firm stance over Iran’s ballistic missile program, raising the prospect of possible sanctions on Tehran with regard to those activities. ‘Victories do not mean total annihilation of Daesh’ General Jafari also said that recent victories in defeating Daesh in Iraq and Syria do not mean a total annihilation of the terrorist group. The Sovereignty of Daesh has been annihilated, he noted. Daesh has not been completely annihilated and has gone underground in various countries especially Afghanistan, he said. “So, we put on agenda fighting their plots,” he added. Armed forces in Iraq and Syria, backed by popular mobilization units and Iranian military advisors, have managed to flush Daesh militants out of their last strongholds in both countries, declaring full victory over the notorious group. Commenting on Saudis’ hostile approach towards Iran, Jafari said that Iran is practicing “self-restraint” because the country seeks to counter the U.S. and Zionist regime of Israel and not their allies. He added Iran does not seek to enter “direct confrontation” with Saudi Arabia. NA/PA
