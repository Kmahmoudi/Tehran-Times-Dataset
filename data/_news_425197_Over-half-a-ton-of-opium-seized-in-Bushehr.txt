TEHRAN – Some 560 kilograms of opium have been seized in Kangan County in the coastal province of Bushehr in southern Iran, according the province’s marine commander, IRNA reported on Saturday. “The haul was unloaded from a boat when seized; one person was arrested during the operation,” said Colonel Vailiollah Rezaee-nejad, IRNA said. He added that in the first three months of the current Iranian year (beginning March 21) about two tons of narcotics have been seized in the province bordering the Persian Gulf. Iran, as the country neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan, is a transit road for drug-traffickers. Many Iranian soldiers get killed every year in the fight against drug traffickers.
