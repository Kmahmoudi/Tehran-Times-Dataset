TEHRAN- Mohammad Eslami, the chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), said on Sunday the Islamic Republic will retaliate strongly against a resolution that was passed by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Eslami stated as it has been previously stated the resolution is unquestionably an attempt to apply the greatest amount of pressure on Iran but it would not benefit them. “We had previously stated that the issuance of resolution is quite an unconstructive move for keeping maximum pressure and will not help the other sides for resolving the existing issues,” the nuclear chief remarked. The resolution, drafted by the European trio (Britain, France, and German also known as E3) and the U.S., was approved by the IAEA board on Thursday. Out of 35 members of the board, 26 voted in favor, five abstentions and two countries absent. Russia and China voted against the resolution.  Eslami also said the IAEA chief himself believes that issuing resolutions will not be helpful to address questions. “We had heard from the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi that the resolution would be detrimental,” maintained Eslami, who is also the vice president. The three European nations and the United States appear to be accustomed to using various methods of exerting pressure, such as issuing resolutions and imposing sanctions, he continued, warning that such demands would be futile. He also referred to the Islamic Republic's previous stance on the resolution, warning that any anti-Iran activity will be met with a harsh response from Tehran. Eslami went on to declare that Iran's nuclear program will be carried out in accordance with the Strategic Action Plan to Lift Sanctions and Protect the Iranian Nation's Interests, which was adopted by the Iranian parliament, and that repeated resolutions will have no effect on the nuclear program. All national-level activities are aimed at boosting the welfare of the nation and propelling it forward, he concluded.
