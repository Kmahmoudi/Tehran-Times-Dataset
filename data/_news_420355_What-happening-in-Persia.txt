The latest unrest in Iran was not by no means worse than what happened to the country during the Shah time and later during Saddam Hussein’s ruling in Iraq. I am not in the position to defend Iran, because the brotherly Muslims of Iran and their wise leadership don’t need our defense. They are capable and efficient in defense and can defeat their enemy. Their past experiences are known and their management of the recent mayhem is clear. No matter how we differ ideologically from the brothers in Iran, our agreement with Iranian Muslim brothers is much immense and greater. The Islamic Republic in Iran has provided support for the Islamic resistance in Palestine and Lebanon. The southern Lebanese will tell you about those who have provided finances and arms to their freedom fighters with no expectation. The dwarf Mohammed bin Salman is a total puppet of the United States. So, don’t even think that he was in charge of jeopardizing Iran’s ruling establishment or its security. The U.S. administration with dirty money provided by certain Persian Gulf Arab states as well as exploitation of harsh living conditions in Iran, which are the result of the brutal Western-led economic sanctions on the country for decades, provoked the simple-minded Iranians to spark unrest in the country. I believe the sedition in Iran will end soon, as we will finish it here, in Yemen, through faith and wisdom, despite the aggression and the brutal siege going on over the past 33 months. As the “kingdom of sand” began to raise prices madly this year, it will be the end of the regime of al-Saud, al-Nahyan, and their puppets.
There will be victory for the vulnerable people in Najd, and Hija, and loss for traitors of the nation’s religion and the Quran. The enemy will weep with their masters, Americans and Jews, and Jerusalem and Mecca will be liberated.  The future is bright.
