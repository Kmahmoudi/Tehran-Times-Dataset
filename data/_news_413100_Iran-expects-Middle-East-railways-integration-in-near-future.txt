TEHRAN - Iran expects an integrated railway transport system in the Middle East to be established in the near future. “As a linkage between East and West, the Middle East has a great role in boosting the region’s railway traffic,” IRNA quoted Saeid Mohammadzadeh, the managing director of the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRIR) as saying. Mohammadzadeh made the remarks in the 19th UIC Regional Assembly for the Middle East (UIC RAME) which was held in Tehran on Tuesday. The UIC (French: Union Internationale des Chemins de fer) or International Union of Railways is an international rail transport industry body aiming to promote rail transport all around the world. The UIC Middle East coordinator, regional office manager, and representatives of UIC RAME members including Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Jordan, and Turkey attended the assembly meeting. During the meeting, UIC Director General Jean-Pierre Loubinoux said that there are great potentials for cooperation in the region. Developing and completing railway transportation systems, sharing technical knowledge, and standardizing rail transport sector are among the main steps being taken by UIC in this regard, he added.
