TEHRAN- Iran attracted $12 billion in foreign investment during the past Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20), ISNA quoted Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Ali Tayyebnia as saying. The minister said that the country could manage to attract the mentioned volume of investment as a result of proper measures taken by the government and also the positive environment created in post-sanctions era.  Sustained and stable economic growth is a priority for the country, Tayyebnia said, adding all requirements for achieving this goal should come to attention. Iran has signed memorandums of understanding aiming to attract $50 billion of finance with other countries after the implementation of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in January 2016, which lifted the sanctions against Iran’s economy, according to the finance minister, who said the preliminary measures have been taken to finalize the MOUs. The minister put emphasis on the significance of investment making in economic plans by both domestic and foreign entities and underscored the necessity of attracting investors. According to a report released by the Finance Ministry in late March, the value of foreign investment in Iran stood at $3.1 billion in 2013, $2.1 billion in 2014, and $2.05 billion in 2015.
