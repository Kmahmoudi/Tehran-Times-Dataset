TEHRAN - Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has reiterated Tehran’s position that the Islamic Republic is ready to expand its interaction with the Persian Gulf Arab littoral states. In an interview with IRNA published on Tuesday, he said President Hassan Rouhani’s visits to Oman and Kuwait demonstrated Tehran’s “good will” and “willingness to have good relations” with its southern neighbors. “The trip also shows our determination to establish relations with our southern neighbors and the necessity of interaction and dialogue in the current international system,” Qassemi explained. He noted that Iran has always sought to have “constructive” and “logical” interactions with the neighboring countries on the condition that these countries show interest. The Foreign Ministry official also said security and stability in the Middle East region can be established through “collective solidarity”. Qassemi said that the Islamic countries should consult with each other and have good ties in spite of different views. He added Iran seeks relations based on the principle of sovereignty and non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs. Elsewhere, Qassemi expressed hope that all the Persian Gulf littoral states would become aware of the danger of terrorism and adopt “logical” policies. "The Persian Gulf littoral states should become aware of the fact that the states’ interests are intertwined and that all the countries are influenced by regional developments," the diplomat remarked. Rouhani visited Oman and Kuwait on February 15 on separate invitations sent to him by Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said and Kuwait’s Emir Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber Al Sabah.
