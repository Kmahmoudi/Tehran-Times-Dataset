TEHRAN - Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said on Sunday that Iran’s parliament will firmly support missile programs as the only pre-emptive weapon against constant threats.
 Iran is against having nuclear and mass destruction weapons and develops its missile capability as a “pre-emptive policy” against threats, he told reporters on the sidelines of an open session of the parliament. On June 18, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps fired six missiles into eastern Syria, targeting Islamic State strongholds in retaliation for the ISIS terrorist attacks in Tehran on June 7. Elsewhere, Boroujerdi said that the reason behind the U.S. Senate action in imposing new sanctions on Iran is its failures in Iraq and Syria. On 15 June, the U.S. Senate voted nearly unanimously for legislation to impose new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile activity, its alleged human rights violation and claims of support for terrorist organizations. Boroujerdi said such actions are intended to stop Iran’s influence in the region, the top parliamentarian said. He added, “Our policy is clear. We will firmly fight terrorists based on our strategic policy… and will not back down from our position.” NA/PA
