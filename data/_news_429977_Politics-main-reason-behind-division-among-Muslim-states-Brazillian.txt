TEHRAN – The division which is now seen among some Islamic states is mainly because of politics, said Muslim Brazilian activist Garcia Gomez. Gomez, who is a pro-Palestinian activist in South America, made the remarks in an interview with Mehr News Agency on Saturday on the sideline of the 32nd Islamic Unity Conference in Tehran. Here is the full text of the interview: Q: What is your opinion about this conference and what are the barriers in route to achieve unity among Islamic countries? A: It is important for Muslims and the world of Islam to understand the importance of unity because if you do not be united, it would be easy for enemies to defeat Islamic countries. In my opinion, the Muslim community needs to be gathered together to acknowledge the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) because I see now in the Islamic communities too much difference in opinions; ‘I’m Sunni’, ‘I’m Shia’, mainly because politics have divided people. It is very important for the Muslims to understand that unity is key to continuing existence. Q: And how do you see measures adopted by the Islamic Republic of Iran in creating unity among Islamic countries? A: Sure, it’s so excellent. The media have programs to lie about Iran and Shia community. The conference here is very a very compelling measure to bring about unity among Islamic states.
