TEHRAN - As the governor's rule comes to an end in Indian-controlled-Kashmir on Wednesday, the region reeling under violence is set to come under President’s rule from Thursday. According to a report in IANS, quoting government sources, the center recommended President's rule following a report submitted by state's Governor Satya Pal Malik on Tuesday. A communication from Governor's office was sent to the BJP government in New Delhi which gave its approval to the President's rule in the troubled state. The state plunged into a political crisis in June this year after People's Democratic Party (PDP) lost support of its coalition partner — India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over some irreconcilable differences. The 6-month Governor's rule, which means direct rule of the federal government in New Delhi, came into force following the breakup of PDP-BJP coalition. After six months, the state comes directly under President's rule for another six months after which elections have to be held, as per the Constitution. Meanwhile, the security situation remains tense in the conflict-torn region following the killing of seven civilians last week. All commercial establishments, schools and offices remained closed for three days in protest against the killings. The killings were condemned by politicians across the political spectrum, who urged the security agencies to exercise restraint in dealing with people's protests. Militancy in the troubled state, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan, has gained momentum in last few years especially since the killing of young rebel commander Burhan Wani.
