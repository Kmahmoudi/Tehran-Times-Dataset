TEHRAN- Gasoline production in Iran will increase 12 million liters within the next four months, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh announced on Monday. The official put the country’s daily gasoline production at 15 million liters in the past Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20), Tasnim news agency reported. Zanganeh also announced that Iran will have no gasoline import since the second half of the current calendar year (starting on September 23). In mid-December last year, the minister had said that Iran will reach a stable status in gasoline production once the second phase of Persian Gulf Star Refinery comes on stream. The refinery in the southern province of Hormozgan is the first of its kind designed based on gas condensate feedstock. Planned to have a total crude oil processing capacity of 360,000 barrels per day, Persian Gulf Star is projected to be complete by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2019). Once fully operational, the refinery will add over 36 million liters of Euro-4 and Euro-5 quality gasoline to the country’s gasoline production capacity to increase it to 100 million liters per day.
