In 2006, some 5.1 million people were 60 or older, but the number rose to 6.1 million in 2011 and to 7.4 million in 2016. Currently, the country’s total population stands at about 80 million, of which some 9.3 percent is 60 or older. In September 2018, Shahla Kazemipour, an Iranian demography expert, predicted that by the year 2050 older persons will make up 20 percent of the country’s population. “Older persons need special care and the clinic will not only provide the senior citizens with medical services but also rehabilitation services as well,” he added.  Examples of aging-associated diseases are cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, dementia, cataract, osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. The incidence of all of these diseases increases rapidly with aging, disabled-world.com wrote.  Some consequences of aging are age-related changes in vision, hearing, muscular strength, bone strength, immunity, and nerve function. Elsewher in his remarks he said that public are interested in Iranian traditional medicine and using herbal medicine to treat their diseases, so that the Iranian traditional medicine clinic will be inaugurated in an attempt to use such methods with scientific methods.  A traditional drugstore offering herbal medicine will be set up in the clinic as well, he added. The clinic will stop misuse of herbal remedies and traditional medicine which could have negative and adverse side effects, he concluded.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
