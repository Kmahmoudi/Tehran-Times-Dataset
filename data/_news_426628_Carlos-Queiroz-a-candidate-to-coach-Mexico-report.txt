TEHRAN – Iran national football team coach Carlos Queiroz has been added to the list of candidates for the vacant Mexico national team job. Following the departure of Juan Carlos Osorio as Mexico national football team coach, the Mexican Football Federation’s managing director Guillermo Cantu has met with Queiroz, FOX Sports reported. Queiroz has coached Portugal, the UAE, South Africa, and most recently, Iran in the 2014 and 2018 World Cups. The Portuguese also served as an assistant to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United for some time, while worked as a coach at Real Madrid, Sporting Lisboa, NY Metrostars, and Nagoya Grampus Eight. The news of the interest for Queiroz comes after Tigres coach Ricardo “Tuca” Ferretti seemed to have taken his name out of the list of potential candidates. Mohammad Reza Davarzani, Iran's deputy sports minister, has recently said Queiroz would lead Team Melli in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup in the UAE. Queiroz has yet to extend his contract with Iran national football team. Under guidance of him, Team Melli earned a shock win over Morocco and impressed against Spain and Portugal.
