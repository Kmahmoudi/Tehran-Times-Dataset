TEHRAN- The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has been called to an urgent meeting by Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi to discuss the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories after Israeli forces stormed the al-Aqsa Mosque violently overnight, fired stun grenades, and attacked Palestinian worshipers. During a phone call with his Indonesian counterpart Joko Widodo on Thursday, he demanded that the 57-member body call an emergency meeting to come to a consensus on how to defend the rights of defenseless Palestinians and confront the crimes of the Tel Aviv regime. The Iranian president stressed that “support for the rights of the Palestinian nation and fight against the Zionist regime constitute an underlying principle of the Muslim Ummah,” referring to Palestine as the “beating heart of the Muslim world.” “The unity of the Muslim world remains essential in order to face down the aggression and crimes committed by the Zionist regime,” he continued. The Iranian president stated that the Muslim world, as a powerful bloc in global politics, needs more unification. Raisi declared that Iran supports any activity aimed at fostering better ties among Muslim nations as a result. Widodo, for his part, supported his Iranian counterpart’s request for an urgent OIC conference on Palestine in the hopes that it would strengthen ties between Muslim-majority countries. The OIC General Secretariat announced shortly after the call that an urgent, extended meeting of the Executive Committee at the level of Permanent Representatives would be held on Saturday at the OIC’s Jeddah headquarters to discuss the incursions and assaults committed by Israeli occupation forces against the al-Aqsa Mosque and its worshippers. Iran FM talks to OIC chief over attack on Al-Aqsa Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian also telephoned OIC Secretary General Hussain Ibrahim Taha on Thursday night requesting an urgent meeting to discuss atrocities of the Zionist regime at the Al Aqsa Mosque. The Iran’s top diplomat also stated that the emergency meeting should take place at the level of the foreign ministers and declared that Iran is prepared for whatever type of cooperation required for the successful convening of the emergency meeting.   He also pointed to President Raisi’s phone conversation with his Indonesian counterpart on the subject, and informed the OIC chief about Iran’s other plans in this regard. In a tweet on Thursday, Amir Abdollahian criticized Israel for defiling the Al-Aqsa Mosque and asserted that the tide of Islamic world unity has bewildered the Israelis. “The desecration of al-Aqsa Mosque by Israeli forces and their night raid on worshipers of the holy site created painful scenes that are the result of the behavior of human rights advocates who turn a blind eye to Zionism’s crimes,” he added. Israeli troops attempted to drive Palestinian worshipers from the holy site on Wednesday by firing rubber bullets and grenades during their second consecutive raid on the location. In reaction, worshipers flung items at the Israeli soldiers. At least six individuals were hurt in the most recent flare-up, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Concern and dismay about Israeli soldiers’ invasions inside the mosque have been voiced by the UN, Iran, Turkey, and several other nations and organizations. Images showing Israeli security personnel abusing individuals at the Al-Aqsa Mosque surprised and disgusted UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, his spokesperson said on Wednesday. Guterres found it particularly upsetting because the “violence and beating” took place “during a time of a calendar which is holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims that should be a time for peace and nonviolence,” Guterres’ spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. He said, “Places of worship should only be utilized for lawful religious practices.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
