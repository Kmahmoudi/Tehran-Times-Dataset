Iran is geostrategically positioned to play an integral role in Russian-South Asian connectivity. President Putin told the Valdai Club during its annual meeting in October 2019 that “there is one more prospective route, the Arctic – Siberia – Asia. The idea is to connect ports along the Northern Sea Route with ports of the Pacific and Indian oceans via roads in East Siberia and central Eurasia.” This vision, which forms a crucial part of his country's “Greater Eurasian Partnership”, can be achieved through the official North-South Transport Corridor (NSTC) and tentative W-CPEC+ projects that transit through the Islamic Republic of Iran. The first one refers to the creation of a new trade route from Russia to India through Azerbaijan and Iran, while the second concerns the likely expansion of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC, the flagship project of China's Belt & Road Initiative [BRI]) westward through Iran and largely parallel to the NSTC. W-CPEC+ can also continue towards Turkey and onward to the EU, but that branch is beyond the scope of the present analysis. The NSTC's terminal port is the Indian-backed Chabahar, but delays in fully developing its infrastructure might lead to Bandar Abbas being used as a backup in the interim. CPEC's Chinese-backed terminal port of Gwadar is in close proximity to Chabahar, thus presenting the opportunity of eventually pairing the two as sister cities, especially in the event that rumored negotiations between China and Iran result in upwards of several hundred billion dollars worth of investments like some have previously reported. The combination of Russian, Indian, and Chinese infrastructure investments in Iran would greatly improve the country's regional economic competitiveness and enable it to fulfill its geostrategic destiny of facilitating connectivity between Russia and South Asia. What's most intriguing about this ambitious vision is that Iran is proving to the rest of the world that it isn't “isolated” like the U.S. and its closest allies thought that it would be as a result of their policy of so-called “maximum pressure” against it in recent years. While it's true that India has somewhat stepped away from its previously strategic cooperation with Iran out of fear that it'll be punished by “secondary sanctions” if it continued its pragmatic partnership with the Islamic Republic, it's worthwhile mentioning that Chabahar curiously secured a U.S. sanctions waiver. While the American intent behind that decision is unclear, it might have been predicated on the belief that the Iranian-facilitated expansion of Indian influence into Central Asia via Chabahar might help to “balance” Chinese influence in the region. It could also have simply been a small but symbolic “concession” to India in order not to scare it away from supporting the U.S. anti-Chinese containment strategy. It's difficult to tell what the real motive was since American-Indian relations are currently complicated by Washington's latest sanctions threats against New Delhi in response to its decision to purchase Russia's S-400 air defense systems. Nevertheless, even in the worst-case scenario that Indian investment and infrastructural support for Iran can't be taken for granted in the coming future, that still doesn't offset the country's geostrategic plans. Russia could still use the NSTC to connect with W-CPEC and ultimately the over 200+ million Pakistani marketplaces. In theory, Russian companies in Pakistan could also re-export their home country's NSTC-imported goods to neighboring India, thereby representing a pragmatic workaround to New Delhi's potential self-interested distancing from that project which could also provide additional much-needed tax revenue for Islamabad. Iran must therefore do its utmost to ensure Russia's continued interest in the NSTC regardless of India's approach to the project. Reconceptualizing the NSTC from its original Russian-Indian connectivity purpose to the much broader one of Russian-South Asian connectivity could help guarantee Moscow's support. In parallel with that, Tehran would do well to court Beijing's investments along W-CPEC+'s two branch corridors to Azerbaijan/Russia and Turkey/EU. Any success on any of these fronts, let alone three of them, would advance Iran's regional interests by solidifying its integral geo-economic role in 21st-century Eurasia.   Andrew Korybko is a political analyst, journalist and regular contributor to several online journals, as well as a member of the expert council for the Institute of Strategic Studies and Predictions at the People’s Friendship University of Russia.
