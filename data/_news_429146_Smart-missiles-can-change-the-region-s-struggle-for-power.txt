TEHRAN - Yemeni army forces, supported by allied fighters from Popular Committees, have achieved much in the past four years in their resistance against the Saudis crimes. On Sunday, Brigadier Yahya Saree, spokesman of Yemeni Armed Forces and Popular Committees addressed last week’s military operations and missile tests prior to unveiling Badr P-1 missile. The spokesman for Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement Mohammad Abdulsalam, too, congratulated the production of the very first the precision-guided missile called P1, calling it a sign of Yemenis capability and creative and innovative minds.   The Mehr news agency has recently conducted an interview with Abdulaziz Ahmad al-Bakir, deputy minister of the Yemeni National Salvation Government to discuss the issue further.  Following is the full text of the interview. Q. Recently, the Yemeni army forces unveiled a new generation of ballistic and ‘smart’ missiles. How do you assess the significance of this military achievement for the Yemenis? A. The achievement will encourage the Yemeni army forces to do more and better and rely on their own capability and shift the power in the region. Q. What plan do the Yemeni army forces have to counter the UAE and Saud Arabia? Can the Yemenis directly target Riyadh and Abu Dhabi?    A. Defending our homeland is our legitimate rights approved by Abrahamic religions and human principles and laws, and we don’t allow its violation. Q. The brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi has made some of the western governments to halt the sale of munitions to the Saudis. What is your stance on that? A. First things first. In Yemen, we only trust in God. Second, our resistance to the crimes committed by the Saudis will eventually change the balance of power in the region. The Yemeni War has entered its fourth year and the people of Yemen continue to show patience and stand against atrocities of the House of Saud. God has promised victory to the oppressed and pious people, and we count on His promise. Q. Do you believe Muslims help the Yemenis when taking part in massive rallies like the Arbaeen March? A. Yemenis are God-loving people and descendants of the Ansar [the people from Medina who supported Prophet Muhammad], Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) and Ahl al-Bayt (People of the House). Therefore, from the historical and Islamic point of view, we follow these great figures, in particular, Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (Cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad).
