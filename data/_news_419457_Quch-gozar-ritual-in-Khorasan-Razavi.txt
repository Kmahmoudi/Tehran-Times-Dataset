In mid-summer, nomads in Khorasan Razavi Province, northeastern Iran, hold Quch-gozar ritual. The ritual is held by cattlemen to choose their shepherds for the coming year. They gather people in villages with playing dohol (a large cylindrical drum) and sorna (an ancient Iranian woodwind instrument). Women attend the ceremony in traditional dresses holding trays containing especial bread called fatir and some fruits.  During the event, they pray for an affluent year and entertain with traditional games. At the end, a kind of traditional food called ‘yakhni polo’ is served for the guests. Various tribes and ethnic groups who live in different parts of Iran are just like colors, which make a great painting. Iran is home to about 20 ethnic groups who live in different regions of the country. SB/MQ/MG
