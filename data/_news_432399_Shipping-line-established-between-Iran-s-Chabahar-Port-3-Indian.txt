TEHRAN- A shipping line was established between Iran’s southeastern port of Chabahar and three Indian ports of Mumbai, Mundra, and Kandla, an official in Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization (PMO) announced. Behrouz Aghaei, the director general of Sistan-Baluchestan Ports and Maritime Department, said the line was set up by the arrival of the first container ship to Shahid Beheshti Port of Chabahar on Sunday, IRNA reported. The official said the ship will unload its 3,700 TEU cargo at Shahid Beheshti Port. Having the loading and unloading capacity of 8.5 million tons of commodities per year, Shahid Beheshti Port can berth the ocean liners with the capacity of up to 100,000 tons, Aghaei noted.
