TEHRAN - Iranian Intelligence Minister Seyed Mahmoud Alavi announced that his forces have foiled dozens of terrorist plots in different parts of the country last year. "We identified over 20 terrorist teams who were trying to conduct sabotage activities last year, killing some of them and arresting others," Alavi said, addressing pre-sermon speech of Tehran's Friday prayers. The Iranian intelligence minister also noted that his ministry's forces killed leader of Ansar al-Forqan terrorist group. In mid-April, Alavi announced that the country's security forces had arrested a dangerous terrorist, adding that he was supported by certain regional countries. "A terrorist whose mission was conducting blasts was arrested by the security forces... in the Western parts of the country," Alavi said. "Certain regional states are behind this ominous and failed operation," he added. His remarks came after Commander of Iran's Law Enforcement Border Guards Brigadier General Qasem Rezayee announced that his forces had disbanded three terrorist groups with plots to carry out sabotage acts in the country in the past Iranian year (ended on March 19). "Members of three terrorist groups were arrested at the country's Eastern and Northwestern borders," Rezayee told reporters in a press conference in Tehran. "These terrorist groups were identified and arrested in separate operations by Iran's dedicated border guards at the Eastern and Northwestern borders last year," he added. Rezayee explained that one of the disbanded terrorist groups included a Pakistani and two Iranian nationals who were carrying advanced equipment.
