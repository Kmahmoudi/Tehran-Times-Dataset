TEHRAN -- Iranian female professor, Marzieh Moosavi-Nasab, from Shiraz University, has gained 2019’s Suffrage Award in Science and Technology in the UK, IRNA reported. The Suffrage science award is granted in order to promote the leading roles held by women in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The award, introducing women's scientific success, makes attempts to remove gender inequality in scientific fields.  Moosavi-Nasab has presented more than 250 scientific papers and she has provided guidance to more than 60 graduate students. Dr. Zohreh Azimifar, Associate Professor at the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shiraz University, was the previous winner of Suffrage science award, 2017. For Iranian women, the family is the foundation of life and society and Iranian women make special efforts to encourage their offspring to study hard in different fields of basic sciences, arts and literature, said the female scientist speaking at the award grating ceremony in UK. MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences tweeted that Azimifar, associate professor of Shiraz University and adjunct professor of University of Waterloo has passed her heirloom to Marzieh Moosavi-Nasab, also of Shiraz University, for having numerous impacts in motivating and encouraging young students, in particular female students, to continue in higher education. The Suffrage Science scheme celebrates women in science for their scientific achievement and for their ability to inspire others. It encourages women to enter scientific subjects, and to stay. This public engagement scheme was initiated in 2011, by the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC), a biomedical research institute of the UK’s Medical Research Council.  The award was granted on the occasion of the International Women's Day, March 8th.
