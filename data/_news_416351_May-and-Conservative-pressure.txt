TEHRAN_ The British prime minister is going through difficult days. A new round of negotiations on Brexit is set to begin soon. The members of British Conservative Party are also pressing Theresa May to abandon power. Some Conservative members, who are still in shock over the recent general election, believe that May's history of political power has expired and she should resign as Prime Minister David Cameron did. However, May has been able to remain in power with the support of senior party members. The British prime minister has set the date for her resignation, during meetings with some members of the party. According to the Mirror, May has revealed that she will quit on August 30, 2019. It means she has two years to get Britain out of the European Union. It seems that party pressure on May to resign from power has intensified. Conservatives rightly believe that May's action in early elections not only led to a reduction in the number of Conservative party representatives in the House of Commons, it also increased the power of Jeremy Corbyn and other Labour party officials. May's incorrect calculation of the domestic situation in Britain and her hopes for victory in the early elections, have put the Conservatives in a difficult situation. It means that the prime minister won’t be able to lead her party into another election and will be gone by September 2019. But in the world of politics nothing is foreseeable. This is also true for May. Undoubtedly, the outcome of the Brexit talks could have a great impact on the prime minister's political future.  Certainly she will have a difficult way ahead in dealing with the members of the party. Now the question is: Can she manage the turmoil in the Conservative party? All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
