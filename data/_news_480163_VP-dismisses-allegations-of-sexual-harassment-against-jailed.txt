TEHRAN- The allegations made by the Western media outlets concerning treatment toward female inmates have been denied as completely false by the Iranian vice president for family and women's affairs. Ensieh Khazali said on Monday that she recently paid a visit to the women's wards at Tehran’s jails and had a conversation with every single jailed woman.  "I talked to every woman there for a long time, and the women officials who were with me also talked to every woman, and we received their letters, and are still investigating their cases," Khazali explained. The vice president emphasized the charges that female prisoners were “being sexually harassed are at all untrue." Khazali continued by emphasizing that "officials at the office of the vice president for women's affairs talked to the female prisoners in private sessions."
