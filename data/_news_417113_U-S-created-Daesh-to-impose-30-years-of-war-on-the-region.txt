TEHRAN – The Iranian ambassador to Baghdad has said the United States created Daesh so that the region “would be at war for 30 years.”  Iraj Masjedi said Washington is deeply concerned over the imminent collapse of Daesh, noting the terrorist group has been defeated in Iraq and Syria with the help of the Islamic Republic, the Hamshahri newspaper reported on Monday. Iran only wants peace and prosperity for neighboring Iraq, he added. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
