TEHRAN— According to media reports, officials from Tehran, Baku and Moscow will hold a tripartite meeting intended to assess ways to enhance economic ties between the three regional powerhouses. 
 In this regard, Seyyed Abbas Mousavi, Iranian ambassador to the Republic of Azerbaijan met Shahin Mustafayev, Deputy Prime Minister and the Azerbaijani Chairman of the Joint Economic Commission with Iran on Friday. In this meeting, discussions were held regarding the latest developments in economic and trade relations between the two countries and its 22% increase, as well as joint projects, especially in the field of transportation. The upcoming tripartite meeting between Iran, the Republic of Azerbaijan and Russia regarding regional transportation corridors which is scheduled to be held next week was also discussed.  The North-South corridor and the Rasht-Astara railway in particular is on the agenda of this tripartite meeting which is going to be held in Baku. In an exclusive interview with the Tehran Times published on August 2, Mousavi named a few projects besides the North-South corridor as major joint projects between Tehran and Baku.  “As I said, our relationship with the Republic of Azerbaijan is one of kinship and neighborliness. Many people tried to influence this relationship and prevent it from being warm. It is natural that if two Muslim countries are close to each other, many people will be unhappy and upset. We do not want to please anyone,” the diplomat said of Iran-Azerbaijan ties. He then noted, “We have big joint projects. We are building a new and big bridge in Astara, and if this bridge is inaugurated by the end of this year, the volume of transit between Iran and Azerbaijan, which is about 200 trucks per day from the Astara region, can reach 800 or even 1000. We are pursuing a joint dam construction project.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
