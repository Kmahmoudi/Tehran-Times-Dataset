At the meeting, the two ministers singed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on bolstering cultural and tourism cooperation between the two sides. From early days of the Islamic Revolution, Iran was determined to broaden ties with African countries and has always viewed Sierra Leone as a friendly country, said the Iranian minister. "We have always supported the struggles of the African people for independence as well as safeguarding their identity," he said. Referring to the new colonial approaches in the world, he recalled that in the past the colonial powers through directly tried to rule over nations but today they resort to hypocritical and satanic approaches to disrupt relations between newly independent counties and their neighbors and friends. To deal with cultural inroads, countries should bolster and deepen their cultural ties, he underlined. Given common religion between Iran and Sierra Leone, he said there are now good opportunity to help broaden cultural ties between the two sides. An agreement on cultural, scientific and educational cooperation between the two countries would help further broaden relations between the two countries, he said and enumerated such cultural cooperation as exchange of movies, and holding cultural and book fairs by Iran and Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone's minister, on his part, expressed the hope that his visit to Iran would lead to expansion of cultural ties between the two sides. Referring to Iran as a civilized and cultured nation, he said the Sierra Leonean nation knows the Iranian nation quite well and their common religion would give them the incentive to further broaden ties. Sierra Leone has always backed Iran at international forums, he underlined. The MOU underlines exchange of news and information, books, movies, cooperation in tourism, scientific and educational fields, as well as bolstering ties between the two sides radio and televisions.
