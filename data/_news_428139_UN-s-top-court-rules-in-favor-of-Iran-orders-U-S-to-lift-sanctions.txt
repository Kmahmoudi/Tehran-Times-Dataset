The United Nation's top court on Wednesday ordered the United States to lift sanctions on "humanitarian" goods to Iran that President Donald Trump reimposed after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal, The Daily Start reported.
 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) unanimously ruled that Washington "shall remove by means of its choosing any impediments arising from the measures announced on May 8 to the free exportation to Iran of medicines and medical devices, food and agricultural commodities" as well as airplane parts, said judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf. The court said sanctions on goods "required for humanitarian needs... may have a serious detrimental impact on the health and lives of individuals on the territory of Iran." U.S. sanctions on aircraft spare parts also had the "potential to endanger civil aviation safety in Iran and the lives of its users." On May 8, Trump exited the U.S. from the historic deal to the dismay of Washington’s European allies and slapped the first round of sanctions on Iran in August. The second round of punitive measures is due in November. The ICJ rules on disputes between United Nations member states. Its decisions are binding and cannot be appealed, but it has no mechanism to enforce them. ‘ICJ ruling makes it imperative for the world to counter malign U.S. unilateralism’ Following the ICJ verdict, Iran’s foreign minister called on the international community to collectively fight U.S. unilateralism. “UN top court rules that US must comply with obligations violated by re-imposing sanctions on Iranian people when exiting #JCPOA. Another failure for sanctions-addicted USG and victory for rule of law. Imperative for int’l community to collectively counter malign U.S. unilateralism,” Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted. Following the ruling, the Iranian Foreign Ministry also released a statement saying it “sees eye to eye” with the ICJ which has ruled against sanctions on Iran. “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s Foreign Ministry sees eye to eye with the International Court of Justice with regards to its ruling, and the tribunal regards itself as having the preliminary competence to look into Iran’s lawsuit against the U.S. and, hence, has foiled efforts by the U.S. government and its lawyers to dismiss the court’s competence and shirk its legal responsibilities. “… [Today] the world public opinion and all independent countries have more assurance and are determined to show off their resolve to respect international agreements, observe international law and respect governments’ responsibilities with regards to the preservation and implementation of the JCPOA,” the Foreign Ministry stated. “The injunction issued by the International Court of Justice showed once again that it is the U.S. government that is becoming more and more isolated due to its wrong and extremist policies and, as a result, excessive demands from other countries. Hence, the U.S. should drop its wrong habit of, and inappropriate addiction to imposing unfair and illegal sanctions against people and citizens, and turn into a responsible member and an ordinary country of the international community. In this path, the international community and independent countries shoulder a heavier responsibility to foil the illegal attempts of this country, which has a long history of reneging on its commitments and non-compliance with its international obligations.” SP/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
