TERHAN – 227 Iranian lawmakers issued a joint statement on Sunday calling on the Iranian Judiciary to decisively deal with the recent riots and implement the Qisas sentence for those charged with Moharabeh. The statement was read by Ahmad Amir Abadi Farahani in the parliament’s open session. The lawmakers said the recent unrest in Iran was a passive reaction by the enemies in the face of Iran’s extensive victories. They said the United States and other enemies have been implicated in the unrest and have provided weaponry and funding to the rioters. They called on the Judiciary to quickly deal with those charged with Moharebeh by implementing the Qisas against them. The lawmaker also urged the Judiciary to decisively counter those who involved in the unrest. Iranian authorities have said that the unrest erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini was engineered by the U.S. and its allies in the West Asia region. Iran’s President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi said late on Friday that the enemies sought to turn Iran into Syria and Libya, but they failed. In a 4-hour meeting with the students participating in the first course of the "Paths of Progress Camps", Raisi stated, “Riots and attempts to disrupt the country are different from protests, and riots and those who create insecurity must be confronted.” Stating that Iran and its various cities are safe today, the president said, “Americans and our enemies sought to make the country insecure by implementing their patterns in Libya and Syria, but they failed.” Also, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said Saturday that Iran’s recent unrest was a Plan B pursued by the United States but failed in implementing it. Speaking to reporters, Amir Abdollahian said, “What our nation has seen over the last 40 days was the implementation of the very Plan B that the Americans wanted to pursue. But they failed in this regard due to the nation’s intuition and the guidance of the Supreme Leader.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
