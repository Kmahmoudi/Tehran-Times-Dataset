TEHRAN – Iran international defender Morteza Pouraliganji has been linked with a move to Brighton and Hove Albion. Pouraliganji, 26, is available for nothing after his contract with Qatari side Al Sadd expired on July 1, Daily Mail wrote. On Thursday, the Turkish media reported that the free agent center-back is on the verge of joining Trabzonspor. Pouraliganji has 30 Iran caps and played every minute of their 2018 World Cup campaign, where they impressed against Morocco, Spain and Portugal. Pouraliganji can become Brighton’s second Iranian player after the club record signing of Jahanbakhsh. Jahanbakhsh penned a five-year contract with Brighton on Wednesday on a deal worth £17 million ($22.36m).
