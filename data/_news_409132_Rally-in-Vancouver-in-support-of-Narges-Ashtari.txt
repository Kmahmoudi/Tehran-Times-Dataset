TEHRAN - On Tuesday, a crowd of people held a rally in Vancouver outside the Indian consulate office in support of former resident of Vancouver Narges Kalbasi Ashtari. The crowd raised strong objection to the recent judgment made in a local court in Rayagada where Narges was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to a year in jail and fined $4,300. In 2011, Narges, an Iranian-British girl, moved to Rayagada District, Odisha State in eastern India, and opened two children’s homes for the most underprivileged and abandoned children of the area. After her first home was taken from her by a local NGO, ASSIST, through forged document, then came her second home. But this time Narges fought back, making the corrupt organization quite displeased. Narges’s life took a turn for the worst when she found herself charged with involuntary manslaughter. In a one-day field trip set for her visually impaired children in 2014, a couple who both worked for her school brought their two children along for the day out.   However, during the picnic the couple alleged that their older son, a healthy 5-year-old boy, who was not part of Narges’ children, was missing.  They called the police for investigation but a month later they changed the story and accused Narges of killing their son by throwing him into the river and watching him drown. Though later their story changed once again, as they called the picnic area not a suitable location for the excursion for the children. Narges will appeal the Rayagada court decision in a week.
