TEHRAN – On Saturday, Iran’s Expediency Council started deliberations on the bill to join the CFT, a legislation to combat financing of terrorism.
 The council decided to study conformity of the CFT to the general policies of the Islamic Republic system in the future meeting. The Iranian parliament voted in favor of the CFT on October 7. A total of 143 lawmakers, out of 268 ones present in the 290-seat parliament, voted in favor of the bill. To become a law, however, the oversight Guardian Council should vet the bill for compliance with the Constitution. In certain cases when the Guardian Council rejects a ratification by the parliament (Majlis), the Expediency Council acts as an arbiter between the two bodies.
