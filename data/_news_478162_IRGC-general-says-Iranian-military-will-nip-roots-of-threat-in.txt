TEHRAN- The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps Navy has stressed that the main obligations of all military forces are to uproot the provenances of threats to the stability and security of nationals. Speaking to commanders and staff officials of the IRGC Navy, Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri emphasized that the Iranian military has monitored all the enemy’s moves, striving to eliminate all kinds of hazards to the security of the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. The naval commander also decried the recent terrorist attack on the shrine of Hazrat Ahmed Bin Musa (AS), known as Shah-e Cheragh, in Shiraz, saying that Iranian armed forces will never neglect their main mission and task, which is vigilance, monitoring and eradicating threats at the source. He continued, "We keep paving the path of the Islamic Revolution under the auspices of wise Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khamenei, and will by no means back off or feel exhaustion at all.” Daesh has claimed responsibility for the Wednesday attack in Shiraz, capital of southcentral province of Fars province. Tangsiri said any act of terror signifies lack of logic and represents the adversaries’ weakness and decline. He highlighted that slaughtering innocent and civilians will make people more united. The IRGC commander also vowed all perpetrators to receive decisive and crushing response. “Today, the perseverance of zealous nation of Islamic Iran has terrified, confused and greatly embarrassed the enemies and hypocrites, and they have realized that they are in the process of decline and decay. They themselves know that their edifice is about to crumble,” Commander Tangsiri pointed out. The IRGC naval chief underscored that as Imam Khomeini said “we neither oppress nor accept oppression,” underlining that “we keep going the way of standing with the oppressed and dealing crushing blows to oppressors until the full devastation.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
