TEHRAN – Iran’s Ambassador to Copenhagen, Morteza Moradi, said on Sunday that Tehran’s proposal for dialogue among Middle Eastern countries is still up for grabs, ILNA reported. “We are waiting for a day when our neighbors accept this invitation and also encourage their allies in Europe and the West to join in,” Moradi said during a ceremony marking the 39th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. He also pointed to Iranian foreign policy’s success, especially in the region, saying Tehran’s cooperation is a necessity in the fight against terrorism and establishing peace in the region.
