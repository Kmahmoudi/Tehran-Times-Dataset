TEHRAN — Iran’s Foreign Ministry has reacted to recent anti-Iran comments by British Prime Minister Theresa May, saying England which has bred insecurity and waged wars in the region itself is in no position to launch accusations against others. “Countries whose irresponsible interventions in other countries have caused insecurity, war, violence, and terrorism to increase are not in a position to accuse others of interference in regional affairs,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi. Qassemi was making the comments in response to remarks by May during the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council’s annual summit in the Bahraini capital Manama on Wednesday. Recommending ongoing vigilance towards Iran, May had said she is “clear-eyed” about what she called “the threat” Iran poses to the region. Tehran sees the remarks in line with England’s efforts to clinch more arm sales deals with Arab countries. “It seems that such comments aim to pave the way for conclusion of new, hefty arm sales contracts between England and some littoral countries of the Persian Gulf,” he added. During the meeting, May had called for deeper military cooperation with members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council. May said Britain planned to invest more than $3.7 billion in the region over the next decade.  AK/AK  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
