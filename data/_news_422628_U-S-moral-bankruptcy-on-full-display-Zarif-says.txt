TEHRAN – U.S. moral bankruptcy on full display, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Friday, pointing to Washington’s anti-Iran sanctions despite being aware that Tehran was not seeking nuclear weapons. “U.S. moral bankruptcy on full display in CIA chief's admission of U.S. policy: in the past Iran was sanctioned over false claims that it sought nuclear weapons. Now, sanctions must be reimposed because we seek no nukes?” Zarif tweeted. He was pointing to recent comments by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who said, “Iran wasn't racing to a weapon before the [nuclear] deal. There is no indication that I'm aware of that if the deal no longer existed that they would immediately turn to racing to create a nuclear weapon today.”  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
