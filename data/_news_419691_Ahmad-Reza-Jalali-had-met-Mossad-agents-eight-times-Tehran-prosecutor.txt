TEHRAN – The Supreme Court has approved the death sentence against an Iranian researcher for spying for Israel’s Mossad spy agency, Tehran Prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi confirmed on Monday. Ahmad Reza Jalali, who has been in prison since April 2016, was shown on national TV earlier this month confessing to providing information to Mossad about Iranian military and nuclear scientists, including two who were assassinated in 2010. The convict had admitted that he had eight meetings with Mossad’s agents and that he had received money in exchange, Jafari-Dolatabadi told a meeting of judiciary officials, IRNA reported. The prosecutor said Jalali had passed information to Mossad agents about projects related to the Defense Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), including information about the AEOI plants, the ministry’s plans and blueprints of important buildings belonging to the ministry and the AEOI. He had also provided Mossad with the names and information of top executives of the AEOI and the Defense Ministry, Jafari-Dolatabadi said, adding that according to Jalali’s confessions, he had used flash memories to gather information from the individuals’ computers. “Most of the information provided by the aforementioned person included complete and documented information about thirty top figures working on research, military, defense and nuclear projects, including the two martyred [scientists] Ali Mohammadi and [Mohammad] Shahriari,” he remarked. The convict was given money and Swedish citizenship for himself and his family in exchange for the information, he added.
