TEHRAN – Over 500 billion rials (roughly $12.5 million) will be channeled into building new eco-lodge inns across Hormozgan province in southern Iran. The fund has been earmarked for paying loans of maximum 1 billion rials (about $25,000) at four percent [annual] interest rate to each eligible applicant, Mehr quoted Mohsen Ziaei, the provincial tourism chief, as saying on Sunday. “The eco-lodges should bear traditional architecture and texture and have at least 16 beds.” “Catering for travelers with local cuisine and traditional music and taking advantage of indigenous traditions and codes are amongst the most important features of such eco-lodges,” the official explained. Over the past couple of years, Iran has witnessed a boom in its ecotourism market, drawing more domestic and foreign backpackers to its pristine and relatively undisturbed natural landscape.
