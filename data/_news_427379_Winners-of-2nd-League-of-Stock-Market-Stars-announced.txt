As reported, 34 teams from 34 universities of the country participated in a two-month competition organized by Securities and Exchange Organization (SEO). It is while the number of participating teams was just 10 in the previous edition of the competition held in August 2017.

Addressing the Sunday ceremony, SEO Head Shapour Mohammadi said: “In this event, we tried to focus on investing on the principles of science and observance of ethical standards in order to gain a better market experience in the field of capital, while many participants in this contest had a very good learning and some kind of culture for transactions in the capital market.” The aim of the event was to familiarize the society with the capital market and to test the practical knowledge of business and finance students, in a bid to elevate the financial knowledge in the society. Holding the first edition of this league was among the first-ever successful experiences of Iran’s stock market in the past Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20, 2018). Of the other first-ever achievements it could be referred to the data vending deal which was signed between Iran Financial Center (IFC) and Greece’s Inforex S.A., and also the first offering of wheat at guaranteed price in Iran Mercantile Exchange (IME) instead of the guaranteed purchase of the grain by the government.
