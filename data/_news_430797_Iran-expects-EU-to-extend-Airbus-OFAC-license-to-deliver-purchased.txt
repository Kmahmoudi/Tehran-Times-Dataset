TEHRAN - Farzaneh Sharafbafi, the managing director of Iran Air, Iran’s national flag carrier, said on Monday that Iran expects EU to get the U.S. approval for extending the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)’s license for importing the airplanes Iran bought from Airbus. Speaking in a press conference, the official mentioned the deals Iran Air has with foreign aircraft makers and said Iran is strictly following these contracts. On January 28, 2016, Iran Air signed a deal with the French giant plane maker Airbus for the purchase of 118 Airbus jets worth $27 billion, however only three are delivered to the country. Iran Air also signed a contract in April 2017, to buy 20 planes from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR. Sharafbafi further noted that ATR has delivered five new aircrafts to Iran by extending its OFAC license. “As done for ATR, EU should also get the Airbus’s OFAC license extended”, she said. Of its total purchases, so far Iran has only received 13 ATR airplanes and three Airbuses.
