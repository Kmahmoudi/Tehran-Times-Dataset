TEHRAN - Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, said on Saturday that the Iraqi Kurdistan’s independence referendum is tantamount to strengthening Daesh, the Tel-Aviv regime, new regional anarchism, and instability. “Strong support for Iraq’s national unity is the real support for the Iraqi Kurds,” he tweeted. Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government held independence referendum last Monday. KRG President Masoud Barzani turned a cold shoulder to international calls against the referendum.
