TEHRAN – Benefactors in Tehran have donated some 18 billion rials (nearly $400,000) for the financially struggling students through a charity event prior to the upcoming school year (starting September 23), head of the provincial Relief Foundation has said. Known as Jashn-e Atefeha (literally meaning the festival of kindnesses), the event which solicits contributions in-kind or cash by referring to schools, mosques or online banking, has been held for 22 years by Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation. The second phase of the event will be held at schools on October 3, where students can grant their donations to those students in need, Fars quoted Hamidreza Shiran as saying on Wednesday. “Some 18 billion rials (about $400,000) have been donated in Tehran to help underprivileged students for the current school year,” he stated. Currently, some 11,334 students in different educational grades and 1,933 college students in Tehran province are provided with the educational services of the Foundation, he concluded.
