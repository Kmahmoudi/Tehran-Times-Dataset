TEHRAN- Two platforms of phase 14 of developing Iran’s South Pars gas field (in the Persian Gulf) will be installed on their offshore spots by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2018), Mohammad Meshkinfam, the managing director of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), said on Sunday. Meshkinfam made the remarks on the second day of the 22nd Iran International Oil, Gas, Refining and Petrochemical Exhibition (Iran Oil Show 2017), which is running at Tehran Permanent International Fairgrounds, Shana reported. Phase 14 is expected to produce 56.5 million cubic meters of sour gas and 75,000 billion barrels of gas condensate per day, one million tons of liquefied gas and one million tons of ethane per year, and 400 tons a day of sulfur. POGC is in charge of implementing development phases of South Pars gas field. The huge offshore field, shared with Qatar, covers an area of 9,700 square kilometers, 3,700 square kilometers of which, called South Pars, are in Iran’s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf. The remaining 6,000 square kilometers, called North Dome, are situated in Qatar’s territorial waters.
The field is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate. MA/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
