Photo depicts people visiting Bagh-e Dolat Abad, a richly manicured historical garden in Yazd, central Iran, on July 10, 2017. An octagonal pavilion surmounted by an imposing wind tower is seen in the picture as well. The interior of the pavilion seems superb to almost all visitors, with intricate latticework and exquisite stained-glass windows. For centuries, such indigenous design has brought comfort to dwellers in summer times. It is part of an innovative architecture when combined with cold and fresh subterranean waters flowing beneath mudbrick houses of the ancient city.Â  Located on the margins of a desert, Yazd is famous as the city of wind towers. Moreover, the city enjoys a very harmonious public-religious architecture. On July 9, the historical structure of Yazd was made a United Nations World Heritage site. The genuine concept of the Persian Garden that is deeply rooted in time interweaves natural elements with manmade components to embody an idea of creating a paradise on Earth by the means of artistic, philosophical, figurative, and religious notions.
