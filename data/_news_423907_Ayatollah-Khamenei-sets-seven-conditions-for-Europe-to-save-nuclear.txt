TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei set out seven conditions for European powers if they want Iran to stay in the nuclear deal after the U.S. exit.
 The Leader set the conditions at a meeting with the heads of the three branches of government, ministers top managers, military commanders as well as political and cultural figures late on Wednesday. These are the list of conditions: 1- Given dishonesty of the three European countries [Germany, the UK and France] in the early (13)80s [Iranian calendar years] on the nuclear issue, the Europeans must prove that they do not intend to repeat that dishonesty. 2- The three European countries did not complain about the U.S. repeated violations of the spirit and text of the JCPOA and they must make up for this ignorance. 3- The U.S. withdrawal is violation of the 2231 resolution of the UN [Security Council]. The Europeans must take a resolution against the U.S. to the UN Security Council and file complaint against the U.S. move. “The heads of the three European countries must pledge to avoid mentioning Iran’s missile program and presence in the region.” 4- The heads of the three European countries must pledge to avoid mentioning Iran’s missile program and presence in the region. 5- The Europeans must counter any kind of U.S. sanction against Iran. All must know that the Islamic Republic will not abandon its factors of power especially its defense capabilities. 6- If the U.S. impedes Iran’s sale of oil, the Europeans must guarantee purchasing oil from Iran as much as the country’s needs are met. 7- The European banks must guarantee transactions with Iran. ‘Iran reserves the right to resume nuclear activities if conditions not met’ Elsewhere in his remarks, the Leader said, “Iran does not seek confrontation with the three European countries, however, we do not trust them based on their record. So, they must give actual guarantees.” Ayatollah Khamenei said, “Economy of the country cannot be built by European JCPOA.”  “The European banks should guarantee transactions with Iran.” Ayatollah Khamenei added Iran has the right to resume its restricted nuclear activities if the Europeans failed to meet the Islamic Republic’s demands. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also called on the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) to prepare itself to resume enriching uranium to the purity level of 20 percent if Iran’s conditions are not met. “We do not resume [uranium] enrichment at 20 percent purity now, however, you should be ready to resume activities which were restricted under the JCPOA if the JCPOA is no more useful,” he said. On May 8, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the UN-endorsed nuclear agreement and vowed to reimpose sanctions on Iran. After the U.S. withdrawal, Iran wants assurances from the remaining parties that its interests are guaranteed or it will resume its nuclear activities with a higher speed.
