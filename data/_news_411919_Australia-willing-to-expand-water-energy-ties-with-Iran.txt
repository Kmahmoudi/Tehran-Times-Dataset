TEHRAN – Australia is willing to expand economic ties with Iran especially in water and energy sectors, IRNA quoted South Australia’s Minister for Investment and Trade as saying on Sunday. According to the report, Martin Hamilton-Smith made the remarks in a meeting with Iranian Deputy Energy Minister for Planning and Economic Affairs Alireza Daemi in Tehran.
“With the post-sanctions opportunity presented, we hope that the two countries take necessary measures for expansion of ties in various sectors including water management, technology, energy efficiency, renewable energies, and seawater desalination,” Hamilton-Smith said.
The official also expressed hope for expansion of academic and research cooperation between the two countries saying that some of the world’s leading universities are located in South Australia and they are ready to share their experiences with Iran.
Mentioning the trade turnover between the two sides, Hamilton-Smith noted that the worth of annual trade between the two sides is about $1.5 million which is relatively low. 
Iranian deputy minister for his part said Iran is open to new investment and financing in areas like climate change, renewable energies and seawater desalination and the country welcomes interested Australian companies in this regard.
"There is also a very good potential for cooperation between universities of the two countries to conduct joint research in water and energy,” Daemi said. EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
