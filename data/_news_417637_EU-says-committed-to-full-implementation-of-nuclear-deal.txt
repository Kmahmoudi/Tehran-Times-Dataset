The European Union issued a statement on Monday after a foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg insisting the 27-nation bloc is committed to the “full and effective” implementation of the nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 “The EU is committed to the continued full and effective implementation of all parts of the JCPOA,” the statement said. It also encouraged the U.S. to maintain its commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal. Following is the full text of the statement published by the EU website: The European Union says the JCPOA, which is the culmination of 12 years of diplomacy and endorsed by UN Security Council, is crucial for the security of the region. 1. The JCPOA, the culmination of 12 years of diplomacy facilitated by the EU, unanimously endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2231, is a key element of the nuclear non-proliferation global architecture and crucial for the security of the region. Its successful implementation continues to ensure that Iran’s nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful. The EU underlines that the International Atomic Energy Agency has verified 8 times that Iran is implementing all its nuclear related commitments following a comprehensive and strict monitoring system. 2. The EU is committed to the continued full and effective implementation of all parts of the JCPOA. The EU underlines that the lifting of nuclear related sanctions has a positive impact on trade and economic relations with Iran including benefits for the Iranian people. It strengthens cooperation and allows for continuous dialogue with Iran. 3. The European Union considers President Trump's decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the Joint Comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) as being in the context of an internal U.S. process. The EU encourages the U.S. to maintain its commitment to the JCPOA and to consider the implications for the security of the U.S., its partners and the region before taking further steps. 4. While the EU expresses its concerns related to ballistic missiles and increasing tensions in the region, it reiterates the need to address them outside the JCPOA, in the relevant formats and fora. The EU stands ready to actively promote and support initiatives to ensure a more stable, peaceful and secure regional environment. 5. At a time of acute nuclear threat the EU is determined to preserve the JCPOA as a key pillar of the international non-proliferation architecture.
