Here are some of these rituals, which are done by Iranians in different parts of the country to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan:  Welcoming Ramadan in Mazandaran People in the northern province of Mazandaran welcome the holy month of Ramadan by fasting three days before the beginning of the month. They begin to fast from the last days of Sha’ban – the month before Ramadan - which is one of the meritorious months in Islam. They also hold Khatm-e An’am, a kind of ceremony during which the attendees read the Surah Al-An’am from the Holy Quran before the Iftar meal - when people end their fast at sunset. The attendees break their fast with some bread, pinch of salt and some water, which the host put in a large tray by the host.  A bag of blessing in East Azarbaijan On the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan, women and girls of each family in the northwestern province of East Azarbaijan gather together and sew a bag for their family.
