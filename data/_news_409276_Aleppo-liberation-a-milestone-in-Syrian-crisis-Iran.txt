TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Monday that liberation of Aleppo is important event which will help boost security in Syria.
 During a meeting with Sergio Sousa Pinto, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Portuguese Communities, Larijani said that Iraq and Syria have made good advances in wars on terrorism.
