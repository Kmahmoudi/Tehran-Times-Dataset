TEHRAN – A top Russian official says Moscow and Tehran continue to coordinate steps to bolster security in Syria and put an end to hostilities in that country. Mikhail Bogdanov, the Russian president’s envoy for the Middle East and Africa, made the remarks at a meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Jaberi Ansari on Tuesday. “We will continue our consultations. We began them with the Syrian issue, discussed the situation in North Africa (as well),” Bogdanov said. “We are very interested in such vigorous, productive exchange of views and assessments based on trust, the joint analysis of what is going on in the region.” Russia, Iran and Turkey brokered a Syrian peace initiative in the Kazakh capital of Astana in the beginning of 2017. Ever since, the Astana talks have brought representatives from the Syrian government and opposition groups to the negotiating table in order to find a solution to the Syrian conflict.  So far, the sides have convened at the Kazakh capital five times with the sixth round due to take place at the end of August. “The most important thing is the forecast of agreeing specific steps on how to help the peoples in that region, above all the Syrians, to develop optimal specific solutions concerning security, the cessation of hostilities, while effectively fighting terrorists and tackling humanitarian issues,” Bogdanov said. “There are two important platforms here - Astana and Geneva. We appreciate Iran’s contribution [to that process] very much,” the senior diplomat noted. “We have contacts with the Syrian parties, naturally, with Damascus.” Jaberi Ansari arrived in Moscow on Tuesday morning to hold talks with top Russian officials on the latest developments in the Middle East.
