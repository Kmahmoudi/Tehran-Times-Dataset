TEHRAN – Iranian Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian said that his ministry is going to inaugurate 125 major projects under the framework of the A-B-Iran scheme, by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2021). Speaking in the inauguration ceremony of a water supply project in the northern province of Semnan on Monday, Ardakanian noted that so far 125 projects have gone operational across the country under the framework of the mentioned program. According to the official, some 320 trillion rials (about $7.61 billion) so far has been invested in the mentioned 125 projects. Based on the mentioned program, a total of 500 trillion rials (over $11.9 billion) worth of energy projects are planned to be inaugurated and put into operation during the current Iranian calendar year.
