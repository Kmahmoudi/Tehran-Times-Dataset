Russian jet fighters have taken off from an airfield in Hamadan, Iran, to target Daesh terrorists in Syria, the Russians Defense Ministry has said. The announcement demonstrates strong cooperation between Iran and Russia in fight against terrorists in Syria.
The Russian statement on Tuesday said Su-34 and Tu-22M3 bombers took off from Hamadan airbase to target Daesh and al-Nusra Front in Aleppo, as well as in Deir el-Zour and Idlib, destroying five major ammunition depots, training camps and three command posts, according to the Guardian.
The Russian Defense Ministry released a video showing a Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bomber dropping bombs in strikes described as “terrorist objects in Syria”.
It is the first time that Russia has struck targets inside Syria from Iran since it launched a bombing campaign against militants in September last year.
The ministry said the deployment would allow the Russian air force to cut flight times by 60 percent and increase bombing payloads.
Iran and Russia have been supporting the Assad government in Syria. However, the so-called moderate militants have been backed by the West.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
