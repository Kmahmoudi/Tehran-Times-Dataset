TEHRAN- Transit of goods through Iran’s railway network rose 50 percent during the first six months of current Iranian calendar year (March 21-September 22), compared to that of the previous year, Hossein Ashouri, the deputy head of Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (known as RAI), announced, IRNA reported. As RAI has previously announced, transit of goods via Iran’s railway network is planned to reach three million tons in the current Iranian calendar year (which ends on March 20, 2019). Some 1.58 million tons of goods have been transited via Iranian railways in the past calendar year, registering a record in this field. The data released by Iran’s Road Maintenance and Transportation Organization (RMTO) and also Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA) prove that the transit of goods via Iran has been experiencing an increasing trend in the past Iranian calendar year. This trend which indicates importance of the country in regional trade is anticipated to continue in the current calendar year through some underway development plans. In this due, development of transit via railway is on the agenda of the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways. Development of railway network in the border areas is a good opportunity for elevating transit which plays some significant role in bringing more income for the country and also more employment, according to Ebrahim Mohammadi, the previous deputy head of RAI for operation and traffic.
