TEHRAN – Defense Minister Amir Hatami on Tuesday highlighted Iran’s strong opposition to any separatist move in neighboring Iraq, saying Iraq’s disintegration would lead to chaos in the region. “We will spare no efforts in supporting the territorial integrity and stability of neighboring countries,” Mehr news agency quoted Hatami as saying. He added that Iran will expand its cooperation with the Iraqi government in order to confront such “destructive moves”. The minister also warned that such moves would only be to the benefit of the U.S. and the Zionist regime.
