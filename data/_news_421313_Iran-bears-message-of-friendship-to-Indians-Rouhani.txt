TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday that he bears the message of friendship and brotherhood to the people of India.

The president added his presence among the people in Hyderabad shows the “historical and cultural” links between India and Iran goes far beyond economic and political ties. The two great Iranian and Indian nations who have a “common history and culture” have been on the side of each other for centuries, Rouhani pointed out. He also pointed to efforts to cause division among Muslims, saying, “The Muslims are brothers and Islam is the religion for happiness of all human beings.” The president also noted that Iran is following a “view to the East” policy.
