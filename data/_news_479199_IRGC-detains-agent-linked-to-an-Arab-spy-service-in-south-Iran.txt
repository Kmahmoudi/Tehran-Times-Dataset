TEHRAN - The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) has apprehended a spy from a Persian Gulf Arab state's reactionary regime in Bandar Lengeh, southern Iran. The operative from the spy service of the hostile country was plotting anti-security activities in Iran's Hormozgan Province. The arrest was made with advanced intelligence and prompt surveillance, before he could cause insecurity. The eruption of protests in Iran, which followed the death of Mahsa Amini, gave foreign foes a chance to meddle in Iran's domestic affairs and sow as much trouble as they could. The tragic incident, which happened on September 16, provided a pretext for countries and certain figures hostile to Iran to use the death as a pretext to unsettle Iran. The Forensic Medicine found out that Mahsa Amini had died due to complications from a chronic disease rather rumors of a blow to her head by morality police.Â  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
