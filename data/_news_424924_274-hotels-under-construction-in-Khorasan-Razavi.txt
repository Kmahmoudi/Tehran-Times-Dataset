TEHRAN – A total of 274 hotels are being constructed with an average completion of 60 percent across Khorasan Razavi province, northeast Iran.  Over 80 trillion rials (some $2 billion) has been channeled into constructing the hotels that would generate 20,000 jobs when inaugurated, CHTN quoted provincial tourism chief Abolfazl Mokarramifar as saying on Friday. Over 900 hotels, apartment hotels and guest houses are catering to travelers across the province, he said earlier in March. A total of 28.5 million travelers and pilgrims including some 1.7 million foreign nationals visited Khorasan Razavi during the first 11 months of the past Iranian calendar year (started March 21, 2017), Mokarramifar added.
