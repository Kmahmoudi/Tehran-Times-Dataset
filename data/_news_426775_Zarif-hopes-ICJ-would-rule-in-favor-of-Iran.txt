TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that he hopes the International Court of Justice would rule in favor of Iran in its lawsuit against the U.S. sanctions.
 “We believe that the lawsuit is totally legal and we hope that the court would rule in favor of Iran,” ICANA quoted him as saying on Friday in an interview.  He noted that Iran’s “position in the Hague court is very strong”. The ICJ issued a statement in July, announcing that a hearing on Iran’s lawsuit against the U.S. over its move in re-imposing unilateral sanctions will be held in August. “The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, will hold public hearings from Monday 27 to Thursday 30 August, in the case concerning the Alleged violations of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the seat of the Court,” the ICJ website quoted the statement. On July 16, Zarif said Iran had filed a complaint at the ICJ against the U.S. for reintroducing sanctions. “Today Iran filed a complaint @CIJ_ICJ to hold U.S. accountable for its unlawful re-imposition of unilateral sanctions. Iran is committed to the rule of law in the face of U.S. contempt for diplomacy & legal obligations. It’s imperative to counter its habit of violating int’l law,” Zarif tweeted. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and said sanctions will be restored against Iran. According to the U.S. Treasury, the first batch of sanctions will be snapped back on August 6 and the second batch on November 4. Iran and the U.S. signed the Treaty of Amity in 1955 which is still valid according to international law. The treaty consists of an introduction and twenty-three articles and emphasizes encouraging mutual trade and investments.
