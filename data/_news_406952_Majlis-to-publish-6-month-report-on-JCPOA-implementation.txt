TEHRAN – A lawmaker said on Saturday that the Majlis will release its six-month report on implementation of the JCPOA by the end of the current month, which ends on October 21. Speaking to Mehr news agency, Mojtaba Zonnour, head of the parliament’s Nuclear Committee, said, “In order to complete the report, members of National Security and Foreign Policy Committee will visit the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities.” He further said that the exact time of the visit will be announced by the committee in the coming days. “Since the committee is very busy these days, the preparation of the report has taken more time than expected,” he explained. Under the Islamic Republic’s law, the Foreign Ministry must submit every three months a report on the implementation of the JCOPA to the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee. The committee, for its part, must also publish a report on the issue every six months. Iran and the 5+1 group (the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany) finalized the text of the JCPOA in Vienna in July 2015. In July 2015, the UN Security Council turned the JCPOA into an international law by endorsing a resolution, setting the stage for the lifting of the Security Council sanctions against Iran. The nuclear agreement went into effect in January 2016. The IAEA has issued several statements since January confirming Iran’s is abiding by the obligations under the JCPOA.
