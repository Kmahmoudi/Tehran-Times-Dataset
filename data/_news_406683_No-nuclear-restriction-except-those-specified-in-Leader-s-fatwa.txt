“After ten years of restrictions, according to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran will accept no limitation except for the Leader’s fatwa,” Shamkhani told a group of families who lost their dear ones in Iraq’s war against Iran in the 1980s. Under the nuclear deal struck in July 2015 between Iran and great powers the Islamic Republic agreed temporary limitations on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of sanctions. Shamkhani also said that the Western countries’ “historic mistakes” for an instrumental use of terrorism, support for “deviant ideologies” and “double standards” in fighting terrorism have resulted in the current volatile situation in the Middle East. He said that the U.S. government has repeatedly called for negotiations with Iran on the regional developments which shows the failure of its plans. “Overt” and “covert” supports of the U.S. for the terrorist groups have discouraged Iran from holding talks with the U.S. government, he added. The top security official said Iran’s distrust on the U.S. is because of “repeated violations of promises”, “double standards” and “contradictions between its interests and those the Islamic Revolution”. Elsewhere, Shamkhani said that the “Leader’s wisdom”, the “people’s insight and altruism” and “vigilance of various military and security bodies” have empowered Iran and protected the country against foreign plots. He also highlighted the importance of “convergence” among the Islamic countries to counter threats against the world of Islam. “Unfortunately, some reactionary countries’ overt and covert relations with the Zionist regime of Israel are betrayal to the Palestine cause and interests of the world of Islam, and the Muslim nations will not tolerate continuation of such behaviors,” he explained. He said, “Instead of adopting law to restrict the countries’ pilgrims in attending Hajj rituals or form coalition to kill the Muslims, the Islamic countries’ parliaments and leaders should counter threats being posed by the U.S. and the Zionist regime who seek to disintegrate the countries and create division among them.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
