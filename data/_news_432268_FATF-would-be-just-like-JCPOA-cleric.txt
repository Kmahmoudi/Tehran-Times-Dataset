TEHRAN – The interim Friday prayer preacher of Tehran says the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has been created by the think tanks of plundering countries who are after disarming the Islamic Republic. Addressing worshippers in Tehran on Friday, Hojatoleslam Kazem Seddiqi said joining the FATF, like signing the JCPOA, would only lead to harsher sanctions and increased pressure against Iran, ILNA reported. “In the economic war, they want to monitor our spending and know from where we earn our revenues and with whom in the world we have economic interaction,” Seddiqi underlined. “A wise person would never tell its secrets to the enemies,” he warned.
