According to sources in the Iranian Embassy, the main topics of discussion at Ahani's meeting with the leadership of the Russian Foreign Ministry will be the Caspian Sea's problem and issues of mutual interest. Also, a meeting between Ahani and the Russian deputy foreign minister, Russia's Special Envoy Viktor Kalyuzhy is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, August 8. Earlier at a telephone conversation between Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi the sides expressed a common view that the main task of Russia, Iran and other Caspian Sea states must be that the Caspian must remain a sea of peace and tranquility. The conversation was held on the initiative of the Iranian side, says the Russian Foreign Ministry report faxed to TASS on Tuesday. The ministers deem it necessary sooner to agree on the new status for the Caspian, which would make it possible to create a durable legal base for mutually-advantageous cooperation of all Caspian states. The issue of determining the status of the Caspian Sea was discussed at a meeting between President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in early August in Sochi.
