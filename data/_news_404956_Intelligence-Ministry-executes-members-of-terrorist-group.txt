TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Wednesday announcing that it has executed members of a terrorist cell which called themselves “Tawhid and Jihad group”.  According to the statement, some 10 members of the group had been killed in clashes with security forces and some 102 have been identified, tried, and sentenced. 
The group had committed a number of terrorist attacks in western Iran, killing 20 people and injuring 40 others over the past seven years. 
Particularly, the group was active in Kurdistan province, predominantly inhabited by the Kurdish people, it said.   
The statement enlists crimes such as violence, adventurism, ideological extremism, armed burglary, etc. 
In June, Iran’s Intelligence Ministry issued a statement announcing it had foiled one of the “biggest terrorist plots of Takfiri-Wahhabi groups” in Tehran and some other cities.
Western and eastern borders of Iran have been witnessed cases of terrorist activities, mainly influenced by weak border monitoring of neighboring countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
Usually, Iranian forces bust terrorists groups in the regions, while losing forces, keeping a vigilant eye on its mainland.
The country’s intelligence officers have already proven themselves, preventing terrorist blasts in the country, while its vast borders are surrounded by terrorist teams.
This is while terrorist groups have conducted operations in almost all regional countries, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon.
Even European counties have not been safe from terrorist attack. AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
