TEHRAN - Barack Obama, who has ended his presidency with pride and success with the completion of plans such as Iran's nuclear deal, has once again attracted the attentions of the political and social circles inside and outside the U.S. recently. Trump's attempts in destroying whatever that was signed or confirmed during the Obama's presidency, has encouraged Democrats, and most of all, Obama in trying to pull Trump down. The termination of Obamacare subsidies, cancelling Cuba Deal, pulling out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), withdrawal from the international treaties, has mobilized many groups within the United States against the Trump's government. Moreover, it has led to the formation of an anti-American front among Washington's former allies. This is while the United States is facing the Congress elections in November 2018, an election that could turn to a prelude to the 2020 presidential election. Based on the results of the upcoming Congress elections, it can be somehow predicted that which party is going to find way to the White House in the next U.S. presidential elections. On November 6, 2018, which is the day for the U.S. midterm elections, all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate will be contested.   The party which receives 235 seats in the upcoming elections, will have a majority of the House of Representatives and will be the head of the parliament. Right now, in the House of Representatives, Republicans hold the majority with 235 out of 435 seats in this House, while 193 seats belongs to the Democrats. Obama has therefore proceeded to prepare the Democrats' victory in the 2020 presidential elections, through their winning the in the U.S. midterm elections. This is the reason for his meetings with prominent figures of the Democratic Party in recent months. In the same vein, the Express Daily wrote in a report referring to Obama's meetings with Democrats; "BARACK Obama has been preparing for the next U.S. presidential election in 2020 as the world leader has met with at least nine contenders to run against Donald Trump including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Deval Patrick for one-on-one meetings at his Washington office." The report then continued; "It is understood the meetings have taken place at Obama’s personal office on the third floor of the World Wildlife Fund building, and have included discussions on the future of the Democratic Party." In another report, the Daily Express revealed more of Obama's plans and activities regarding the presidential elections; "PRESIDENT Obama is set to return to U.S. politics by leading a fundraiser to help Democrats challenge the Republican Party by changing voting boundaries. The former U.S. president will throw his weight behind a Democratic fundraiser that looks to challenge gerrymandering through state races and lawsuits. The report also noted that "Obama’s spokesman Kevin Lewis said the 44th President wants to support the committee’s “efforts to address unfair gerrymandering practices that leave too many American voters feeling voiceless in the electoral process”. Perhaps it's for fearing Obama's actions that Trump is emphasizing the need for Republicans to win the midterm elections in 2018 in his tweets. Although some experts believe that Obama's return to power would be possible if he decides to nominate himself for the 2020 election, given the traditions existing in the United States, many analysts state that Obama isn't going to be the Democratic Party's candidate for the 2020 election. The eyes are rather fixed on the popular figures of the Democratic Party like Michelle Obama and Joe Biden. Although Michelle Obama has formerly announced that she doesn't have any inclinations to be involved in the electoral campaign, but it is quite likely that the former first lady of the United States would decide to face Trump. On the other hand, Joe Biden, one of the most prominent figures in the Democratic Party, and Obama's vice president, spoke of his desire to participate in the electoral campaign. Meanwhile, some Democratic donors think former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick could beat any of the other major potential party candidates in a 2020 primary. Under these circumstances, and while Trump uses every opportunity to attack Democrats and ridicule Obama's actions, it's hard to foresee the results of the competition between the Donkeys and the Elephants. In the 2016 election, Russia was accused of supporting Trump and taking additional steps which led to his victory in the presidential competitions. Who knows, maybe in the 2020 elections, Europeans, the Washington allies who are seriously disturbed by Trump's lack of commitment, would be accused of supporting American Democrats and attempts for their victory in the elections.
