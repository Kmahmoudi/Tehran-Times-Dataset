TEHRAN - Ukrainian officials have not provided any proof for their accusation that Russia is deploying Iranian drones in its war with Ukraine, according to Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Ashtiani. Ashtiani made the comments following a technical discussion between Iranian and Ukrainian experts. "At the technical meeting, the Ukrainian side did not give any evidence of Russia's deployment of Iranian drones in the fight with this state," he remarked. In the conflict in Ukraine, he continued, allegations that Russian forces utilized drones built in Iran are meaningless since they are based on "baseless statements and speculations." Russia and Iran have both vehemently refuted allegations that Tehran sent Moscow drones for use in the conflict in Ukraine. In July, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made the first anti-Iran allegations, claiming that Washington had "information" indicating that the Islamic Republic was getting prepared to provide Russia "up to several hundred drones, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline" for use in the conflict. In November, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian denied media speculation over Iran's purported backing for Russia in the Ukraine war, but said that Tehran had sold Moscow a small number of drones months before the war began. He also stated that if it is revealed that Russia employed Iranian drones in the fight, Iran will not be apathetic.
