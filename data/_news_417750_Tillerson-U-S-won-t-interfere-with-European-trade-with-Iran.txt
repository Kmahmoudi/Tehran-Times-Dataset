U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the Trump administration does not intend to disrupt European business deals with Iran, a week after Trump’s refusal to certify the Iran nuclear deal. “The president’s been pretty clear that it’s not his intent to interfere with business deals that the Europeans may have under way with Iran,” Tillerson told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday. “He’s said it clearly: ‘That’s fine. You guys do what you want to do.’” Trump has time and again threatened to exit the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was clinched in July 2015 between Iran and six world powers. A week ago, he announced his decision to disavow the accord, leaving the fate of the deal to the U.S. Congress. The decision prompted European Union leaders to reaffirm their full commitment to the deal. “We fully stay committed to the complete implementation by all sides of the Iranian nuclear deal. We see this as a key security interest for the European Union and the region,” said the bloc’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini. Tillerson told the Journal that Washington has been working with the Europeans for six months. “They have been brought along with this same thought process. It doesn't mean that they necessarily agree entirely with it ... Now we will start a more formalized process with them now that the policy's been adopted.” Since the deal went into effect in January 2016, European trade with Iran has surged. However, most large European banks remain reluctant to invest in Iran, fearing U.S. fines.
