TEHRAN – Tehran will welcome with open arms Iranian technicians that are based in the United States, the head of Iran’s presidential office said on Sunday.

 “Unlike those who are so unwise to deprive themselves of scientists and the elite, we will welcome them,” Mohammad Nahavandian told Tasnim in response to the new situation that U.S.-based Iranians are facing after President Donald Trump’s ban on visa for nationals of seven countries including Iran. “The Innovation and Development Fund can help them found their science-based companies.” SP/PA
