TEHRAN – In view of Tehran’s “strategic principled policies” there is a “political solution” to the Yemen crisis, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said Iran insists on a full lifting of blockade on Yemen, inclusive ceasefire, respect to Yemen’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and political dialogue with the involvement of all Yemeni groups. “The Islamic Republic of Iran, based on its principled policy, never sees war as a solution to problems and regional crises and always insists on resolution of problems based on dialogue,” Kanaani said, Iran’s official news agency IRNA reported. He added Iran will use all its energy to press on a just peace based on “the realities of Yemen and establishment of peace, stability and security” in the country and “we hope to see return of stability, security and reinforcement of calm in this great Islamic country.”  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
