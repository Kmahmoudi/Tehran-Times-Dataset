TEHRAN- The IAEA and Iran are currently in official and informal talks, says Abolfazl Amouie, the spokesman for the National Security Committee of the Iranian Parliament.  He added the path for interaction between the two sides is open, but actions like passing a resolution would undermine Iran's cooperation with the IAEA secretariat. In reaction to a resolution passed by the IAEA Board of Governors against Iran on November 17, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) on Tuesday started enriching uranium to purity of 60 percent at the Fordow nuclear plant. In an interview with IRNA published on Wednesday, Amouie said the 2015 nuclear deal – JCPOA - essentially created a balance between commitments by Iran and other countries party to the agreement and each party must honor its obligations. Under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to put limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions. However, the U.S. ditched the agreement in 2018 and the European parties to the JCPOA did not fulfill their obligations.  Iran waited for year and fully respected its commitment. However, after a year Iran said its strategic patience is over and started to gradually remove bans on its nuclear activities. "It was highlighted in paragraph 26 of the JCPOA that the Islamic Republic of Iran has the authority to take compensatory measures if it is determined that the other party does not meet its responsibilities," MP Amouie stated. Iran has reduced its JCPOA responsibilities in accordance to paragraph 26 of the JCPOA. This issue is included in both the JCPOA text and as an annex to UN Security Council Resolution 2231. The parliamentary committee spokesman called the Western and European countries' comments on Iran's compensatory measures “absurd”, noting that the Europeans are abusing institutions like the IAEA board to put more pressure on Iran. Accordingly, such resolutions are superfluous and detrimental to Iran’s cooperation with the IAEA that undoubtedly will elicit a response from the Islamic Republic, Amouie pointed out.  The MP said Iran will take actions in response to resolutions within the confines of the country's civilian nuclear program, which will be reported by inspectors to the IAEA. The November 17 resolution was the second passed in six months criticizing Iran for what it calls insufficient cooperation with the IAEA. Both resolutions were introduced by the U.S. and the E3 – France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Iran responded to the previous resolution in June by removing what remained of the IAEA’s cameras that were installed as part of the JCPOA. The resolution, which its tone was harsh, said Iran has failed to provide answers to nuclear particles found in 2018 at three sites.  Iran has said claims of nuclear traces are bogus invented by Israel. Amouie emphasized that there should be no pressure or charges placed on Iran-IAEA collaboration, adding that Iran has previously responded in text about claims of nuclear particles and has indicated that it is prepared to clarify any doubts.
