TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has praised UNESCO for defending the Palestinian people’s rights and denounced the Israeli regime for its reactionary move. UNESCO on Thursday adopted a draft resolution that strongly condemned the escalating Israeli aggression and illegal measures against the freedom of worship and Muslims’ access to al-Aqsa Mosque in the occupied al-Quds (Jerusalem). A day after the resolution, which twenty-four countries voted in favor of, the Israeli regime suspended cooperation with UNESCO. Pointing to the UNESCO draft resolution, Qassemi encouraged the international body for taking actions in favor of Muslims’ right to access their holy site. Qassemi further condemned Israel for its illegal activities in the Palestinian territories. He also said “the regime’s reactionary move shows its frustration and reveals its deceptive activities.” MH/PA
