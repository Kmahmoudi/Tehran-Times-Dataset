And do you still imagine you can break the will of this great nation & its people?” the chief diplomat asked. Zarif also emphasized, “End of malign U.S. presence in West Asia has begun.” On Sunday, millions of angry mourners from all walks of life participated in separate funeral ceremonies held in the southwestern city of Ahvaz and the northeastern city of Mashhad.
