TEHRAN- The Tehran Jewish Committee has denounced weeks of unrest the followed the death of a young woman in police custody in September, warning of division in the society. The committee, an umbrella body of Jewish groups advocating for Jews in Iran, expressed its support for the Islamic Republic system in response to the unrest in a statement. The committee asserted that it has consistently adhered to the principles set by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei that serve as a guide to counter those who seek to create disorder and insecurity in the country. It maintained that all Iranians’ feelings were wounded by the recent "unfortunate" events. “National unity is in the crosshairs of the enemies of the Islamic establishment, who ostensibly want to undermine security in the Islamic Republic,” it added. The group urged all nationals to avoid dividing the nation and instead interact with authorities in a calm manner about some issues, which, it stated, would surely be to everyone's advantage. The committee anticipated that soon Iran will experience harmony, tranquility, safety, and happiness. Also, a prominent Iranian Sunni cleric appealed for calm last week in the face of adversary intended to destabilize the country, stating that inciting turmoil and causing damage to people's property are obviously at odds with the battle for freedom and democracy. Islam forbids all forms of violence, homicide and acts of sabotage committed during the riots, said Mamousta Fayeq-Rostami, the Friday prayer leader of the Kurdish city of Sanandaj. These acts are opposed to the principles of the holy religion of Islam, the cleric added. Following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in a hospital on September 16, three days after she had fainted in a police station, riots erupted in certain cities in Iran. Amini's death was linked to her medical condition, not to any alleged abuse by police, according to a probe. The past two months have seen rioters and thugs go on the rampage, using the protests as a cover to carry out attacks on security personnel, committing acts of vandalism, desecrating holy sites, and claiming false-flag civilian killings to implicate security forces. Many of these individuals were later discovered to have connections to foreign parties. Amid the riots, Daesh found the opportunity to commit a terrorist act in a holy shrine in Shiraz, capital of Fars province, on October 26 which led to the death of 13 worshippers and injury of 30 others.
