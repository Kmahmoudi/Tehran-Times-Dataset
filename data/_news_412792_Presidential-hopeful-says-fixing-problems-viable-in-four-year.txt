TEHRAN – Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the incumbent Tehran mayor and one of the six qualified presidential hopefuls, said he would overcome problems if he wins the May 19 presidential vote.  “In my opinion, it is not impossible to solve problems in a four-year period and put the country into the orbit,” Ghalibaf said in comments on Friday in the western, borderline city of Illam, implicitly chiding President Rouhani for the sluggish economy. “Bulk of banking loans are in the hands of 400 people,” he lamented.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
