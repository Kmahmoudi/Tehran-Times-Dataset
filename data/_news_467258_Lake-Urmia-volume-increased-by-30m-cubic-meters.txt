TEHRAN – The volume of water in Lake Urmia has reached 2.48 billion cubic meters, which shows an increase of 30 million cubic meters compared to the last [Iranian calendar] month (September 23- October 22). The level of Lake Urmia has now reached 1,270 meters 57 cm above the sea level, which is 63 cm less than the lake’s level compared to the same period last year, IRNA quoted Yaser Rahbardin, director of West Azarbaijan’s water company, as saying on Sunday. Currently, the area of Lake Urmia has been reduced to 1,835 square kilometers, while last year at the same time, the area was recorded above 3,488 square meters, he stated. Of course, the lake’s surface area has increased by about 135 square kilometers compared to the past month, he concluded. Lake Urmia shrinks Lake Urmia level has decreased by about 61 cm compared to last [Iranian calendar] year (March 2020-March 2021), Mehran Nazari, West Azarbaijan province’s department of environment chief, said on October 16. The surface area of Lake Urmia has been reduced to 1,835 square kilometers.In other words, 1423 square kilometers of the Lake’s surface has been reduced, losing 2 billion cubic meters of water, he added. He went on to say that this environmental problem has increased the risk of salt dust storms in the region, which can have adverse effects on human communities and the lakeshore. Shared between West Azarbaijan and East Azarbaijan provinces in northwestern Iran, Lake Urmia, was once the largest salt-water lake in West Asia. It was home to many migratory and indigenous animals including flamingos, pelicans, egrets, and ducks, and attracted hundreds of tourists every year who had bathed in the water to take advantage of the therapeutic properties of the lake. However, decades of long-standing drought spells and elevated hot summer temperatures that speed up evaporation as well as increased water demands in the agriculture sector shrank the lake drastically. In 1999 the volume of water which was at 30 billion cubic meters drastically decreased to half a billion cubic meters in 2013. Moreover, the lake surface area of 5,000 square kilometers in 1997 shrunk to one-tenth of that to 500 square kilometers in 2013. Lake's surface area reached up to 2,917 square kilometers, indicating 1,582 square kilometers increase in comparison to 2013 when the Lake Urmia Restoration Program began. The level of Lake Urmia has reached 1,271 meters, which indicates an increase of over 1.39 meters compared to the lowest volume recorded. However, it still needs 9.5 billion cubic meters of water to reach its ecological level. The above normal levels of rain came to help conservation measures to preserve Lake Urmia, but, this year, the drought and low rainfall are threatening the lake again.
