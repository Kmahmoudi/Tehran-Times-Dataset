TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said on Monday that the Payam satellite will soon be launched into space with an altitude of 600 kilometers.
 Addressing a gathering of people in Golestan Province, he said that scientists in Amirkabir University of Technology have built the satellite. The satellite will observe weather condition, waters and forests, he stated. Elsewhere, he noted that the Iranians are not scared by the enemies’ threats and will overcome all problems. “Neither the U.S., nor the Zionists and their allies are able to bring the great Iranian people to knees,” he remarked. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4.
