Joe Biden, the former vice-president of the U.S., has said that annulling the 2015 nuclear will isolate the U.S. from its allies.
 He defended the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in an interview with PBS NewsHour published on Thursday. The nuclear deal was signed between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia - in July 2015. The agreement went into effect in January 2016. Under the deal, Iran is obliged to put restrictions on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions.  So far the International Atomic Energy Agency has issued nine reports each time confirming that Iran is abiding fully to the terms of the agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump, in a statement issued on October 13, refused to certify Iran’s compliance to the nuclear deal and asked Congress to decide about the fate of the nuclear deal. However, Congress passed the ball back to Trump by letting the deadline on reimposing sanctions on Iran pass. Trump must decide in mid-January if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions on Iran.
