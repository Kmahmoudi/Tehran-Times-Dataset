TEHRAN – Iran’s Foreign Ministry summoned Denmark’s Ambassador Danny Annan on Thursday to lodge protests over a second attack on Tehran’s diplomatic mission in Copenhagen since January.   “Denmark’s ambassador to Tehran was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and Iran’s strong objection was conveyed to him over the action,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi. Any future attacks without serious measures to punish attackers will question the Danish government’s intentions and damage bilateral ties, Qassemi added.
 
Tehran also called on the Danish government to act “decisively, responsibly, and seriously.” Voicing regret over the attack and calling it unacceptable, Ambassador Annan said he would echo the concerns to the Danish government. It was the second time this year that Iran’s diplomatic mission in Copenhagen has been targeted.
 
On January 19, Danish police arrested six people who had earlier scaled the walls of the Iranian embassy in Copenhagen, drawing a strong condemnation from Tehran. The six, described as four Iranian expatriates seeking asylum in Sweden and two others holding Swedish residency, violated the Iranian diplomatic premises in the Danish capital. The incident saw the invaders enter the mission’s courtyard earlier in the day, putting up profane placards and forcing down the Iranian national flag from the flagstaff. Following the incident, the ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Ministry, being notified of the Islamic Republic’s protest over the attack. Also in April 2016, Iran summoned Denmark’s temporary chargé d’affaires over acts of vandalism and destruction carried out by four anti-Iran protesters.  AK/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
