TEHRAN – A collection of handicrafts bearing needlework embroideries has been put on show at the headquarters of the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization in Tehran. Handcrafted by some 30 female breadwinners who are native of the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, the collection contains women’s wear, household furniture, and sets of personal ornamentation amongst others, Mehr reported. Needlework (Souzan-douzi in Persian) is a very common occupation among people of the province. It is the art of drawing images on plain fabrics by sewing delicate stitches using needle and colorful yarns. Organized under the auspices of the CHHTO exports department, the weeklong showcase comes to an end on December 27.
