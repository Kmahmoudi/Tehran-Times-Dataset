TEHRAN - Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that it is Tehran’s policy to settle conflicts through dialogue.
 During a meeting with a European delegation headed by Janusz Lewandowski, a member of the European Parliament, Larijani also said Iran is committed to fulfil its obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal. “Iran remains committed to the JCPOA [the official name for the nuclear agreement] and the U.S. and some of its allies’ baseless accusations must not impede the process of implementing the deal,” Larijani remarked. He added U.S. President Donald Trump tries to prevent other countries from interacting with Tehran through his repeated anti-Iran comments and demonizing the Islamic Republic. The nuclear agreement was signed by Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia - in July 2015. It took effect in January 2016. The U.S. under the Trump administration is the only party which has made repeated attacks against the nuclear deal. In his new Iran strategy declared on October 13, President Trump decertified the nuclear deal and asked Congress to decide about the fate of the agreement.  The U.S. administration has called for a renegotiation of the nuclear agreement, a request vehemently rejected by all other parties. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, has issued nine regular reports each time confirming Iran’s adherence to the international deal.   Under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions. ‘Intl. determination required to eradicate terrorism’ Larijani also said that Iran has made every efforts in fight against terrorism, however an international determination is required to eradicate this phenomenon. For his part, Lewandowski said that Iran plays an “effective” role in fighting terrorism.  He also noted that recent victories in defeating Daesh in Iraq and Syria are not the end of the story. Armed forces in Syria and Iraq, backed by Popular Mobilization Units and Iranian military advisors, have managed to flush Daesh militants out of their last strongholds in both countries, declaring full victory over the notorious group. Elsewhere, Lewandowski called for expansion of relations between Iran and the European Union. NA/PA
