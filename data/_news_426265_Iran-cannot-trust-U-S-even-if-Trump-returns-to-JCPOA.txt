TEHRAN – Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said on Tuesday that Iran does not trust talks with the Trump administration even if the U.S. returns to the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 “Even [U.S. President Donald] Trump’s return to the JCPOA will not guarantee that the U.S. will not violate its commitments. Iran has no trust on talks with the U.S. based on experience,” he said during a visit to Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province. He also noted that the U.S. credibility has been questioned after its withdrawal from the JCPOA. Trump, who unilaterally withdrew Washington from the UN-endorsed 2015 nuclear agreement in May, said on Saturday that holding talks with Tehran is up to the Iranians. First in a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on July 30 in the White House Trump said he is ready to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without any pre-conditions. “It’s good for the country, good for them, good for us and good for the world. No preconditions. If they want to meet, I’ll meet,” Trump said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised program late on Monday that he has no precondition for talks with the U.S., except that Washington “compensate” the past damage that it has done to Iran. “America owes Iran both apologies and reparations for the meddling and damages he has been doing to Iran since 1953,” Rouhani said. “Trump should stop ‘bullying’ and ‘deceptive’ behavior”  Intelligence chief Alavi said that it has been for 40 years that the Iranian people have been resisting sanctions and pressure. Trump should stop “bullying” and “deceptive” behavior towards the Iranians, the intelligence chief added. Alavi said the U.S. seeks to disappoint the Iranians and cause division between the government and people through exerting pressure and launching “psychological warfare”. “Trump should know that the Iranian people cannot be deceived by the U.S. officials’ evil plans and childish games,” he said.
