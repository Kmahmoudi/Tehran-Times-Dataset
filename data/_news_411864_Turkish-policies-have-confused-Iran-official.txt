TEHRAN - Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific Affairs Ebrahim Rahimpour has said that Iran is unable to understand some policies adopted by Turkey.
 “We have make efforts to help Turkey after the coup attempt…, but the fact is that we do not understand some policies of the Turkish government,” he told ISNA in an interview published on Saturday. Rahimpour said, “Some problems may have made Turkey to resort to the Zionist regime of Israel, Saudi Arabia and Trump.” He expressed hope that the Turkish officials would adopt policies based on “realities” and “long term objectives”. “Some of Turkey’s actions in Syria have not been in line with Iran’s interests; however, we did not create a commotion and waited for Ankara’s government to understand that Iran is the best help,” the deputy foreign minister remarked. Rahimpour also said that Iran and Russia are making efforts to involve Turkey in efforts to settle the long-running conflict in Syria. “We think that we can forget everything about Turkey and have more serious cooperation in settling the crisis in Syria and preventing interference in Iraq’s affairs,” he noted. The Foreign Ministry official said that Iran can still trust Turkey given the economic interaction between the two countries. Elsewhere, Rahimpour said that Iran has never “played the cards of the U.S., Israel and extra-regional powers” to fulfill short term objectives. Commenting on Iran’s relations with Russia, the diplomat the two countries will continue cooperation as long as it benefits the two sides. “We will interact with the Russians to the extent that they cooperate with us and we will not be willing to cooperate with them when they are not willing to do so,” the deputy foreign minister pointed out.
