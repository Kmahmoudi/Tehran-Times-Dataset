He further said, “Other exceptional cases will be handled at the request of the highest level official of the relevant body and confirmation of the vice president,” the announcement read. “The decision has been taken to reduce possible disease transmission to the country from foreign states.

On Tuesday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said it essential that citizens follow health guidelines to help boost the country’s battle against the coronavirus outbreak. “These guidelines must not be disobeyed, because God has made us duty-bound to feel responsible for the health of ourselves and others,” he said. He added, “Anything that helps prevent the spread of coronavirus is a good deed and anything that helps spread it is a sin.” The Leader also said that all must fully cooperate with the Ministry of Health, which is at the forefront of the fight against Coronavirus.  “The Armed Forces and the sectors related to the Office of the Leader have also been ordered to do the same,” he added. Elsewhere, Ayatollah Khamenei said, “Coronavirus has affected many countries. Our officials have reported with sincerity and transparency since day one. However, some countries where the outbreak has been more serious have tried to hide it. Of course, we ask God to heal the sick in those countries too.” MJ/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
