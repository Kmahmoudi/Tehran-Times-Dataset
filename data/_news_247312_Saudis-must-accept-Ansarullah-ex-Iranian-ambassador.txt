A coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia launched on March 26 a military campaign in Yemen against Ansarullah revolutionaries, otherwise referred to as Houthis. The Saudiâ€™s goal was to restore to power former President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who had resigned on Jan. 22, just days after he and the Houthi had reached a power-sharing deal. Hadi is currently in exile in Saudi Arabia.
