TEHRAN – More than 50 consecutive tremors, with different levels of severity, shook the city of Sumar in the western province of Kermanshah on Thursday.
 The chain of earthquakes began at 10:29 a.m. (local time) with a magnitude 5.6 tremor. Till the end of the day, consecutive tremors kept hitting the region, five of them measuring more than 5 on the Richter scale. Professor of engineering seismology Mehdi Zare said to Khabaronline on Thursday that if all these tremors had accumulated and occurred in one earthquake, most likely a massive magnitude 7 tremor could have resulted.  The quakes could be triggered by the magnitude 7.3 earthquake of Kermanshah which hit Azgaleh on November 12; this could be domino effects of that earthquake, Zare explained.  Such chain of quakes are not farfetched in Zagros region and are totally normal, he added.  No damage and fatalities have been reported, said the Rescue and Relief Organization spokesman Mostafa Mortazavi, adding that the epicenter of earthquakes were an area largely home to nomads, Fars reported on Thursday.
