TEHRAN – The Iranian president’s special aide for ethnic and religious minorities has said the Islamic Republic will support any country that fights Israel.

 “We are defending a government which has stood up against Israel. If Jordan or Saudi Arabia made the same resistance, we would support them,” Ali Younesi told ISNA on Sunday. Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia are trying to misrepresent Iran’s support for resistance as a sectarian policy, which they know is not true, he said.
