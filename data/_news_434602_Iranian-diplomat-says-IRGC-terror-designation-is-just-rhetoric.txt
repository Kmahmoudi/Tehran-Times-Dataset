TEHRAN – Iran’s Ambassador to the UK Hamid Baeidinejad has said that designation of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps as a terrorist organization by the U.S. is just a rhetoric.
 “I think this is a part of the rhetoric because in fact the realities show that they are not at all interested to see what are the implications of making such decisions for example in the region and within the Iranian nation,” he said in an interview with CNN. “The leaders in the region are very concerned and they have contacted the people in Washington and ask for revision of this kind of decision. They are objecting this policy by the U.S.,” the ambassador added. He noted that the IRGC enjoys great support among the people and it has a very solid position in terms of receiving support from the people. Elsewhere, he called the act a gift to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was facing reelection on April 9. “They are not interested to see the consequences and just want to help Netanyahu,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump labeled the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization on April 8.
