TEHRAN - Chinese relief and rescue teams have located bodies of two of the Iranian oil tanker’s crew on Saturday morning, six days after the ship collided with a bulk freighter and caught fire off China’s east coast. Sirous Kianersi, managing director of the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), said although the rescue team was able to retrieve the ship’s black box but they were turned back by high temperatures and lack of oxygen, Shana reported. Last Saturday, the tanker Sanchi, owned by NITC, which was carrying one million barrels of condensate to South Korea, collided with the freighter CF Crystal that was carrying grain from the United States about 184 km off China’s coast near Shanghai.
