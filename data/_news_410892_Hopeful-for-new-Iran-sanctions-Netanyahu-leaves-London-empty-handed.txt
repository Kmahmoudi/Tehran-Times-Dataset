TEHRAN – The visit to London by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must have had a serious impact on his confidence as he failed to gain London’s support for imposing fresh sanctions on Iran. The trip came ahead of Netanyahu’s get-together with U.S. President Donald Trump, due to take place later this month. Reportedly, England’s Prime Minister Theresa May has resisted pressure from the Israeli regime to re-negotiate the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and impose new sanctions.
 
Prior to his London visit, Netanyahu had spoken of a coalition with England and the U.S. to combat what he called Iran’s “extraordinary aggression.”
 
Reacting to Netanyahu's efforts, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman described them as “flogging a dead horse.”
 
“Israel has always been trying to pick sides and make efforts to damage Iran’s interests and those of the oppressed Palestinian people,” he added. AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
