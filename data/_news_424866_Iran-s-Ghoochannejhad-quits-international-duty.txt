TEHRAN – Iran national football team striker Reza Ghoochannejhad has retired from international duty on Wednesday. Ghoochannejhad, nicknamed ‘Gucci’, was a member of Iran national football team in the 2018 World Cup but remained an unused substitute in three matches against Morocco, Spain and Portugal. He made his senior national team debut on 16 October 2012 in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier against South Korea, where Team Melli edged past the Korean team 1-0. Ghoochannejhad also scored Iran's only goal at the 2014 World Cup against Bosnia and Herzegovina. He did not play for Team Melli in Russia, while Carlos Queiroz’s team lacked the cutting edge in three matches against Morocco, Spain and Portugal. “To wear Iran jersey was a dream which came true for me but I think it’s time to bid farewell to Team Melli. I would also like to thank all my coaches and teammates for helping me grow as a player in the previous six years and wish them all the best,” the Heerenveen striker wrote on his Instagram account. Ghoochannejhad won 44 caps for Iran national football team and scored 16 goals.
