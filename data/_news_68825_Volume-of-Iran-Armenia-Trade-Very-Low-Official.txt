He told IRNA that only 19 percent of Armenia's foreign trade is exchanged with the Islamic Republic of Iran. If the existing obstacles in the way of expansion of bilateral trade are removed, volume of the two countries' trade exchanges will increase to 35-40 percent, he added. Some $120 million worth of Iran's non-oil products is exported to Armenia annually, Mohammadzadeh said adding that agricultural and chemical products as well as foodstuff are major items exported to that country. Referring to his meetings with senior Armenian officials including president, prime minister and ministers of energy, transport, industries, trade and foreign affairs, he said that further expansion of economic ties between the two countries were discussed in the meetings. East Azarbaijan Province, as one of the Iranian major economic provinces, and due to its joint border with the Armenian Republic, may play a key role in further expansion of Iran-Armenia bilateral cooperation, he stressed. Recently, an exhibition of Iranian products was held in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, Mohammadzadeh said. He stressed that Armenian businessmen will actively take part in Tabriz International Trade Fair to be held within August 13-20.
