The technically detailed nuclear deal is working and there is no reason to change its terms, the EU official says  
 Helga Schmid, the secretary general of the European External Action Service, has said that the 2015 agreement on the Iranian nuclear program is working and there are no reasons to change its terms and conditions. The agreement is a very clear, technically detailed document and it is working, she said during her speech at the 2017 Moscow Nonproliferation Conference on Saturday, according to TASS. She noted that Iran’s missiles are not a subject of discussions on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name for the landmark nuclear agreement clinched between Iran, the European Union, Germany, and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. She also said President Donald Trump’s claims about the JCPOA are related to the inner political situation in the United States and cannot influence implementation of the agreement. Schmid said that she plans to visit Iran and discuss with counterparts in Tehran the JCPOA and the energy issues. Wendy R. Sherman, a former undersecretary of state for political affairs who was heavily involved in the nuclear talks with Iran during the Obama administration, also said that about two thirds of the Americans including a number of Republicans support the JCPOA. She noted that only nuclear issue was discussed during the negotiations. 40 countries who had also participated at the nonproliferation conference supported the 2015 nuclear deal.
