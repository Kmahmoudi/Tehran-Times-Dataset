TEHRAN – Veteran painter Ali-Akbar Sadeqi’s book series, which includes “Life”, “Love” and “Loss”, was unveiled during a ceremony at Shirin Gallery in Tehran on Friday. The book “Life” is a review of primary works by the artist such as his graphic designs, illustration works and pictures of his early animated films. “Love” focuses his paintings created over the past 30 years, and “Loss” centers on the poems Sadeqi composed during 2005 and 2006, the years he was suffering from depression. The ceremony was followed by screening a selection of Sadeqi’s early animated films and a short film made by his son Ashkan on the life and works of his father, the Persian service of ISNA reported on Saturday. A number of Sadeqi friends also delivered speeches. Illustrator Farshid Mesqali called Sadeqi an artist who was not impressed by the paintings of the West during his years of activities and remained independent. “He is the only artist who behaves with an artwork like an artisan, that is, if one enters his atelier, greets him, talks to him or even argues with him, he will not be interrupted, and I have not seen this characteristic in many individuals,” he added. Author Javad Mojabi praised Sadeqi for the sense of humor observed in his works, saying, “Satire has made his works seem fresh.” “Sadeqi observes everything with his sense of humor. Scenes of war are seen in his works but when you look closely, you will find out he has made fun of the war scenes instead,” Mojabi told the participants. And a collector of his works, Ali Bakhtiari, said that he has always envied the talent of Sadeqi. “During the years there were no courses on graphic design, he used to work on graphics, and his works have made a good impression on the younger generation of today,” he stated. “When art goes far beyond its time and affects the society, it is praiseworthy. This influence is observed in Sadeqi’s watercolors. They go back to the years of Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) and appeared on postcards and posters to bring back hope and liveliness to the lives of people,” he explained. A collection of Sadeqi’s animated films will be screened during a five-day program at the gallery located at No. 5, 13th St., Karim Khan Zand Ave. Photo: Painter Ali-Akbar Sadeqi delivers a speech during the unveiling his book series “Life”, “Love” and “Loss” at Tehran’s Shirin Gallery on April 15, 2016.
