Poupeh Mahdavi-Nader will start pedaling as of the first day of new Iranian year (March 21, 2003). Talking to IRNA on Monday, she said the main objective behind her one-year tour is to witness signs of the Almighty God, give the message of peace and friendship, practical dialogue, confer with girls and women of different countries, and raise fund for the unattended and poor families. The 29-year-old Mahdavi-Nader added the most high is very kind and has bestowed particular and unique capabilities to every human he has created. "My tour starts in Tehran on March 21," the cyclist said adding that she will pedal to Karaj, Qazvin, Zanjan, Mianeh, and Tabriz. She leaves Tabriz for Istanbul by train and travels to Greece and then heads for Italy by ship.

She flies from London to New York. She moves toward the southern border of the United States on bicycle, passing Miami, California, and Seattle. "Hawaii is my next destination," she said adding "I will conquer the 4,201-meter-high Mauna Kea summit in Hawaii." She will travel to Japan to conquer Fujiyama peak that is 3,777 meters high and then leave for New Zealand. The cyclist-cum-mountaineer has in mind to reach the 3,764-meter-high summit of Mount Cook and thereafter departs for China and India respectively. She walks for three months in China and India and later heads for Oman and then Saudi Arabia.
