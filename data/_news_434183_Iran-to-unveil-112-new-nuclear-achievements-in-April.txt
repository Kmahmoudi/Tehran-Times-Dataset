TEHRAN – Iran is set to unveil 112 new nuclear achievements in April, according to the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI).

 Speaking at a press conference in Tehran on Saturday, Behrouz Kamalvandi described the achievements as “very important” that would cover various fields such as exploration, extraction, fuel cycle, power plants, science and technology as well as laser. The achievements would be unveiled on April 9 which Iran celebrates as National Nuclear Technology Day. “The unveiling of these achievements under the country’s current circumstances will convey this message to enemies that the Iranian nation has resisted economic sanctions and has turned threats into opportunities,” Kamalvandi said. He said the U.S. has waged a “full economic war” against Iran and currently resorts to every ploy to pressure Tehran. “In this war, America puts pressure on all of its allies and non-allies to stop their economic relations with Iran. However, the Iranian nation will strongly pass this phase as well,” Kamalvandi said optimistically. He said Iran should make utmost use of its capabilities to counter the economic war. U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington in May last year from the landmark Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and reimposed sanctions against Tehran. Under the deal reached between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries in 2015, Tehran undertook to put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of nuclear-related sanctions. The sanctions, which the Trump administration has described as the “toughest” ever, have targeted Iran’s banking sector and oil exports. Despite Washington’s withdrawal, Iran has not left the deal yet. However, Iran has stressed that the remaining signatories to the agreement have to work to offset the negative impacts of the U.S. pullout from the agreement if they want Tehran to remain in it. This comes as earlier this month the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) once again affirmed Iran’s compliance with its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA. “Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” Yukiya Amano said in his introductory statement to the IAEA’s Board of Governors in Vienna on March 4.
