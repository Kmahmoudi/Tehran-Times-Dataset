“Now the nightmare of war disturbs all of humanity,” Ahmadinejad stated at the “Islamic World, a Victim of Terrorism” conference, which is currently underway in Tehran. The Zionist regime’s attempt to destroy Lebanon in last summer’s war is another example of terrorism, he said. Terrorism is not only bombing to kill the people; dominating the people and taking control of the natural resources of other countries is also terrorism, he opined. Everyone knows that terrorist organizations are created and planned in the lair of hegemonic powers or are operating with their support, he added. Nowadays, the Islamic world is the victim of organized terrorism, and Iran is the symbol of this victimization, Ahmadinejad stated. There is no terrorism worse than occupying a country under the pretext of saving a nation and causing the massacre of 600,000 people in four years, he said. UN unable to counter terrorism The director of the Foreign Ministry’s Department of Research and Educational Affairs said that since there is “no comprehensive definition of terrorism, the United Nations is unable to fight terrorists.” Differences over terrorism have blocked efforts by the UN General Assembly to formulate a comprehensive definition of terrorism, Manuchehr Mohammadi told the conference participants. He called for a new definition of terrorism in which the use of force by certain countries, which is called state terrorism, would be considered terrorism, and liberation struggles would not be labeled as terrorism. He said, “Today, Iran is more sensitive toward terrorism than others and strongly condemns it because it has suffered from it more than others.” The West has divided terrorism into good and bad terrorism, he added. The “survival and activities” of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) are a result of such a double-standard approach toward terrorism, he noted. Jaafari warns of plot to drag Islamic world into war Former Iraqi prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari told the conference that certain elements seek to drag the Islamic world into “war and bloodshed”. Jaafari, whose compatriots have been fighting terrorism day in and day out, said resistance against terrorism is a “divine act”. He stated that the Iraqi people have always sought freedom and will not abandon this “sacred objective”. He also insisted that it was the “Iraqi people who toppled Saddam Hussein.”
