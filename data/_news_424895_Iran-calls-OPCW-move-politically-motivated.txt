TEHRAN – Iranian Ambassador to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Alireza Jahangiri has said the recent move by the organization is “politically-motivated”. The OPCW voted on Wednesday to support a British-led motion for the body to have the power to attribute responsibility for chemical attacks. The decision was opposed by Iran, Russia, Syria, China, Kazakhstan, India and Sudan. “The West is publicizing obligations of the OPCW to mislead the organization from its duties,” Jahangiri said, according to ISNA. The Western-sponsored mechanism would politicize the atmosphere of cooperation among the member states, he stated. He also warned that the organization is in serious danger with approving the mechanism. This week, Russia, Syria and Iran led the opposition to having the OPCW alter its role. Russia, in particular, used a series of delaying tactics on Tuesday, the first day of the organization’s meeting, to try to call into question its legitimacy or prevent a vote, and on Wednesday the Russian delegation tried again to delay the vote. In addition, Belarus, Syria, Iran, Kazakhstan, Venezuela and others introduced a series of amendments to Britain’s proposal. But all of the amendments were defeated, according to diplomats who were present. MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
