TEHRAN – Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli has said that resistance economy is not restricted to any specific administration, noting it is associated with the Iranian nation and state. “Since the beginning of the revolution until now, many economic systems were recommended for the country and all of them have been tested, but the resistance economy is among the new systems that is approved by everyone,” ISNA quoted Rahmani Fazli as saying on Friday. He also stressed that having faith in the resistance economy is a determining factor for the success of economy. He also said that sustainable security requires a strong economy. Emphasizing that the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is a staunch supporter of resistance economy, Rahmani Fazli said the Iranian nation has the ability to reach any step through resistance. “Today, as the country faces many obstacles, we are witnessing the numerous successes that the Iranian nation has achieved,” he said. The senior official further said that the current administration is determined in pursuing resistance economy, due to its faith in the approach. He also said that in order to realize the resistance economy, Iran needs domestic capabilities and resources as well as foreign market, technology and investment. This, in turn, can open more paths to development, he added. The interior minister further noted that the current administration is attempting to accelerate economic development. He also expressed satisfaction with the current harmony between the three branches of the government, hoping that it would lead to prosperity and economic opportunities for the country.
