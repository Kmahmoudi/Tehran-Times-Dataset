The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was successfully held in Beijing in October. H.E. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, delivered an important report which set forth fundamental policies to guide China’s future development, including deepening the reforms comprehensively, adopting a new vision for development and advancing law-based governance. The CPC’s new leading group was elected and H.E. Xi Jinping was re-elected as General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee for the next five years. As the world's biggest political party with 89 million members, the CPC is leading the country with the largest population and the second largest economy in the world. Over the past five years, by implementing a series of significant policies, actions and plans, the CPC has overcome a lot of long-lingering difficulties and accomplished many long-aspired development goals. Being held at the critical moment of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, the 19th CPC Congress is of epoch-making significance for China’s future.  In H.E. Xi Jinping’s report, it is highlighted that “ the dream of the Chinese people is closely connected with the dreams of other peoples of the world”. With the rise of its position and influence in the world, China is making more and more contribution to the development of world economy and international community. China will adhere to the path of peaceful development and continue its unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace, contribute to global development and uphold international order. China will stick to fostering new international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice, win-win cooperation and building a community of shared future for mankind. China and Iran have enjoyed friendly exchanges for a long time. The ancient Silk Road witnessed the profound friendship between the two peoples. After President Xi Jinping’s successful visit to Iran early last year, frequent high-level visits between China and Iran have been maintained, economic cooperation have achieved fruitful results, and the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership has been promoted to a new level. The 19th CPC Congress provides new opportunities for our bilateral cooperation. China is committed to further expand its opening-up, which will provide huge market potential and more cooperation opportunities for Iran and other countries. I am confident that within the framework of Belt and Road Initiative and with our two peoples’ joint effort, the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership will enter a brand-new era and our cooperation in various fields will embrace a brighter future.
