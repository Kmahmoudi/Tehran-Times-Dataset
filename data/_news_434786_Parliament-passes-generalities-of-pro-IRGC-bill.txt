TEHRAN – Iranian legislators on Tuesday passed the generalities of a bill to support the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) against the United States. The bill received unanimous support, with 204 MPs voting in favor of it and 2 against, Tasnim reported. A few lawmakers who spoke against the bill were in fact arguing that it was not a “strong enough” move to counter U.S. measures. On Monday, the United States officially designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization, a week after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the decision. Iran has condemned the move and warned of its consequences for peace and security in the Middle East.
