TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Sunday that the U.S. Treasury move in imposing new sanctions on a number of Iranian individuals is in line with the Iranophobia project.
 Qassemi’s comments referred to new cyber-related sanctions on seven Iranian individuals and two entities by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday. “The recent action of the U.S. is simply in line with continuation of the anti-Iran policy of Iranophobia by the officials of the White House,” he explained. The official described the U.S. act as contrary to international law and regulations. “Wrong and unfounded accusations of cyber-attacks against the Iranian citizens are contrary to the individuals’ basic rights to access the cyber area,” he added. Warning Washington about its continued hostile policies against Iran, the Foreign Ministry official advised U.S. officials to be aware of the “wrong” and “defeated” policies and avoid behaving “unwisely”. The new U.S. sanctions freeze any assets of the sanctioned individuals and companies and prohibit American citizens and residents and U.S. companies from doing business with them. The sanctions were imposed at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump must decide in October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the agreement. If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. NA/PA
