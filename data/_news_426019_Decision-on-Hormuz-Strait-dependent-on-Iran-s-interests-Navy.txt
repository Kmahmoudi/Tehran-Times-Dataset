TEHRAN - Navy Commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi said on Tuesday that any decision on the strategic Strait of Hormuz is dependent on Iran’s interests.
 Iran has threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz if it cannot export its crude oil.  The Trump administration, which withdrew the U.S. from the international nuclear deal in May, is pressing other countries to cut their oil imports from Iran by November. “Our decision (toward the Strait of Hormuz) depends on Leader of the Revolution’s view,” Admiral Khanzadi told a press conference. Strait of Hormuz is a highly important strategic location for international trade. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates a record 18.5 million barrels per day of sea-borne oil passed through it in 2016. Chief of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari said on July 5 that Iran is ready to implement Rouhani’s threat to block the Strait of Hormuz if Iran would not be able to export its oil under threat of Washington’s sanctions. Elsewhere, Khanzadi said that the Iranian Navy plans to hold war game in future months. He also added that the armed forces will hold drill at the end of the Iranian calendar year in which the Navy will also participate.
