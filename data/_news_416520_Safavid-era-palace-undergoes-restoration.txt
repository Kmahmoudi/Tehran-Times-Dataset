TEHRAN – Several schemes of restoration work have recently been started on Hasht Behesht Palace, an exquisite Safavid-era (1501–1736) structure in Isfahan, central Iran, CHTN reported on Sunday. The restoration project includes missions to buttress the main hall and eastern iwan (portico) of the palace and it also touches upon delicate frescos, plasterwork and wooden embellishments in the interior, said Fereydun Allahyari who presides over Isfahan province’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Department. “Due to the vulnerability of the frescos of this palace, all of which will be protected against [potential] physical damages by installing glass shields in all rooms and the main hall once the emergency restoration is completed,” the official explained. The mural paintings have been damaged during history, the Qajar era (1785 to 1925) in particular, Allahyari added. Hasht Behesht, meaning “Eight Paradises”, was completed in 1669 as one of forty-some mansions which erected in Isfahan during the rule of Safavids. The palace bears intricate plasterwork, woodwork and gorgeous murals even on the ceilings yet retains a domestic simplicity, most of its rooms and chambers are in octagonal patterns. The exterior tilework on the other hand is a source of charm for having a naturalistic style, depicting peacocks, trees, angels alongside other creatures.
