TEHRAN - Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the parliament speaker, said on Tuesday that the emergence of terrorism in the region is due to military interventions in regional countries.
 “Presence of al-Qaeda and spread of it in Afghanistan, and Daesh in Iraq and Syria is product of foreigners’ military interventions,” he said during a meeting with Boubacar Gouro Diall, the Malian ambassador to Tehran. Amir-Abdollahian also said Tehran attaches great importance to the status of Mali in Africa. “Countries in West Asia and Africa have been targeted by Takfiri terrorism and Mali has been able to leave the crises behind,” he said. Amir Abdollahian, a former diplomat, also said terrorists active in south Yemen threaten security of international waters. For his part, Gouro Diall condemned instrumental use of terrorism and said countries which support terrorists will not remain safe from the horrors of terrorism. Elsewhere, he said that the issue of Palestine is very important for Mali. He added Africa supports the Palestinians. The Malian ambassador also said his country prioritizes expansion of parliamentary relations with Iran. Gouro Diall expressed willingness to establish security cooperation with Iran.
