“Elections have not been automated in our country before, but we will try to hold electronic Majlis elections in the provincial centers,” Musapur stated. On the decision to hold the Majlis elections on March 14, 2008, he said that the date was suggested by the Guardian Council, and due to time constraints, the Interior Ministry approved the proposal. The Interior Ministry originally proposed that the election be held on April 11, 2008, but the Guardian Council was concerned that the eighth Majlis might not be able to start its work by May 27, 2008 if the poll was held in April, he explained. He went on to say that the Interior Ministry has made all the necessary preparations to stage the election.
