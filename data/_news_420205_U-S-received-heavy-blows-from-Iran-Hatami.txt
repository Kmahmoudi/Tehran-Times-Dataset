TEHRAN – Defense Minister Amir Hatami on Wednesday warned the United States against any anti-Iran move, pointing to a history of heavy blows the U.S. has received in response. Hatami was reiterating recent remarks by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei about Washington’s repeated defeats when dealing with Iran. “In these few days Iran suffered damage; this will not go unavenged,” the Leader said on Tuesday. It came after riots, backed by the U.S. and Israel, broke out in several cities and town across the country. The riots died down after a week. MH/
