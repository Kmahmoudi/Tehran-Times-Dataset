TEHRAN – Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami said late on Saturday that the ministry under his leadership promotes missile power as first priority and air defense as second.
 “Our priority in the Defense Ministry is missile power and then air defense. Along with that we focus on aerial, naval and ground power,” he said in a televised interview. “We promote our missiles based on threats and for deterrent purposes,” the defense chief remarked. He added, “Proxy wars in the region showed that we must pay attention to ground forces’ power. We make efforts to keep balance among our defense power’s elements.”  The minister said that the home-made Bavar 373 missile shield has passed final tests and will be delivered to the armed forces by the end of the Iranian calendar year, which falls on March 20, 2019. He also said the newest homemade fighter aircraft will be unveiled on Wednesday. Hatami added that Karrar tank has been given to the armed forces for final tests. On August 13 the Defense Ministry unveiled a new generation of homemade pin-pointing missile named “Fateh Mobin”. The radar-evading, tactical and pin-pointing missile is equipped with an advanced and smart explorer and is also capable of penetrating anti-missile defense shields.
