TEHRAN -- About 100,000 Iranians die of high blood pressure annually, Afshin Ostovar, the Health Ministry’s director for non-communicable diseases has said, ISNA reported on Tuesday. Hypertension is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. The National Campaign for Controlling Hypertension, which begins on May 17, World Hypertension Day, focuses on the issue as one of the most important disease lead to cardiovascular disease, which has about 40 percent share of the death in Iran. Hypertension causes about 100,000 deaths in the country, he said, adding that 22 percent of Iranian women and 21 percent of Iranian men suffer from high pressure. In addition, one third of Iranian population above 30 suffer from hypertension, he noted. During past 25 years, the number of Iranians suffering from hypertension has increased by three-fold in Iran, he explained. Some 60 percent of people who have hypertension are aware of their disease and about 6 million ones do not know about their hypertension, he said. One of the main issues lead to hypertension is salt intake, which is three times more than standard amount is twice as much as global standards, he lamented. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults consume less than 5 grams (just under a teaspoon) of salt per day; however, based on global statistics, most people consume too much salt—on average 9–12 grams per day that is around twice the recommended maximum level of intake. Besides over 50 percent of Iranians are insufficient physical active and smoking and alcohol consumption is on the third rank, he said. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) insufficient physical activity is one of the leading risk factors for death worldwide. It is a key risk factor for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes. More than 80% of the world's adolescent population is insufficiently physically active. As a part of national campaign, the blood pressure is checked in stations established in different places like schools, hospitals and mosques, he said.
