TEHRAN – Despite promises, the nuclear deal did not improve people’s livelihoods, the Friday prayer leader of Tehran said.

 “This is while it was said that [with the deal] both [nuclear] centrifuges and people’s lives will be running fine,” Hojjatoleslam Kazem Seddiqi said, Mehr reported. Before Seddiqi’s speech, Hojjatoleslam Qolamreza Mesbahi Moqaddam, a member of the Expediency Council, told worshippers that Iran’s interests are important in ratifying or rejecting FATF. SP/PA
