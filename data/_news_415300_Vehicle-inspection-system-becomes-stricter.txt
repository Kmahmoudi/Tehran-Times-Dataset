TEHRAN – Cars are now being checked up stricter in vehicle inspection centers across the country with a focus on catalyst inspection and emissions control, the deputy chief of Iran’s Department of Environment said. Prior to this, the inspection of vehicles was done according to a bill adopted 22 years ago and the upgraded standards were not considered in the vehicle inspection system, ISNA quoted Saeed Motesaddi as saying. “Nowadays, cars have more efficient systems for emissions control. So, we should update the inspection system as well,” he added. Motesaddi expressed his hope that people would welcome the new vehicle inspection system and have their cars checked up to meet the latest standards. “I hope that the new system would decrease air pollution by 10 percent,” he said. He also pointed out to the inauguration of an integrated vehicle inspection system in Tehran, through which the traffic police can detect any violation and enforce the law by seeing whether vehicles display up-to-date decals stickers using special cameras. As cars are now a part of our daily life and they release substantial amounts of chemicals they appeared to be one of the main culprits for the persisting air pollution in the metropolises of Iran. Majlis (the parliament) has tasked responsible organizations and executive bodies with combating and eliminating air pollution. In this line, the Department of Environment has been authorized to shut down pollutant industries worsening the effects of air pollution in metropolises and decreased the vehicle inspection five-year interval to four years.  SB/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
