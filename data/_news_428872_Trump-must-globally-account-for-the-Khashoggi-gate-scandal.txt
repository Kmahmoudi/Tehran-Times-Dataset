TEHRAN – Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior foreign policy advisor to the Iranian parliament speaker, said on Sunday U.S. President Donald Trump must globally account for the Khashoggi-gate scandal. “Trump must globally account for ‘#Khashoggi_gate’ & support for #Riyadh's death squad. At same time Saudi must be expelled from #UN Human _Rights Council for violating #human rights in #Yemen, #Bahrain & for murdering Khashoggi,” Amir Abdollahian said in a tweet. Dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed weeks ago inside Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul. The incident has been greeted with international condemnation.
