TEHRAN – A pictorial record of the religious ritual of Arbaeen, which is the end of the 40-day mourning period following the martyrdom of Imam Hussein (AS) and his loyal companions on Ashura, has recently been published in a book in Tehran. “The Fortieth” containing photos of the pilgrims flocking to the Iraqi city of Karbala during Arbaeen to visit the shrines of the Imam (AS) and his brother Hazrat Abbas (AS) was unveiled during a ceremony at the Imam Ali (AS) Religious Arts Museum on Friday. The book published by the Shia Art and Culture Institute contains photos by 14 Iranian photographers who have covered the annual ritual from 2009 to 2016. The photos have been captioned by Mohammad-Taqi Ekhtiari. Ekhtiairi, who was attending the unveiling ceremony, said that he has tried to provide information about each photo to make them more attractive. Jasem Ghazbanpur, Saeid Mahmudi, Mehdi Tirani, Ali Bayat and Masud Zendehruh Kermani are among the photographers whose works are published in the book.
