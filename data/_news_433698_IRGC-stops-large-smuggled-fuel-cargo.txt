TEHRAN – Forces of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Intelligence have successfully intercepted the export of a large cargo of smuggled fuel before it could leave Iran, a report by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting said on Monday.

 The cargo consisted of over 10 million liters of gas oil and kerosene and was intended to be carried away by a large smuggling band through legal terminals, the report said. A severe depreciation of the Iranian currency, the rial, against international currencies while the fuel prices have remained unchanged has multiplied the lucrativeness of fuel smuggling in Iran.
