TEHRAN– Gholam-Hossein Shafe’i was elected as the new chairman of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) on Sunday, IRIB news reported. Shafe’i gained the top position in the Iranian Chamber of Commerce by winning 198 votes while his rival Masoud Khansari only needed four more votes to get the position.
Shafe’i replaces Mohsen Jalalpour, whose resignation had been accepted about one month ago.
As he told Mehr news agency on the sidelines of his election ceremony, improving domestic business environment will stand among top priorities of ICCIMA during his tenure, which will last for the next three years. The ICCIMA chairman called for the administration and Ministry of Economy to assist his organization with reaching this goal.
He, elsewhere, told Tasnim news agency that expansion of ties with neighboring and Muslim countries is the other priority of ICCIMA under his tenure.
“We will also seek developed countries cooperation to transfer knowledge into the country,” he added.
Shafe’i addressed the large number of the paid visits by foreign trade delegations to Iran during the past recent months following the removal of sanctions and said that ICCIMA will for sure sign various pacts with applicant countries in the near future.  HJ/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
