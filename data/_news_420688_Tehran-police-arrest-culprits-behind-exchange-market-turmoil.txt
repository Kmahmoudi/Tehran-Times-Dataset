TEHRAN – Police in Tehran have shut down several currency exchange shops and arrested a number of money changers suspected of being behind a recent turmoil in exchange rates. The police intervened after opportunists have been promoting rumors that foreign currencies will gain strength against the national currency. “We are investigating those who impact the foreign exchange market and those who support them behind the scenes and today it has become clear who these individuals are,” Press TV quoted chief of the Police Criminal Investigation Department as saying.
