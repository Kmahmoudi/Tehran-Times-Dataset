 Following the publication of some images on social media alleging the presence of Iranian trucks carrying goods in Karabakh, the Iranian embassy in Baku, denied the report, stating that the images and videos are “incorrect.” The embassy added that at a time when relations between the two friendly and brotherly countries are developing, groups that do not want these relations to develop publish such baseless and false information.
