TEHRAN - President Hassan Rouhani extended condolences on the sad demise of Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, describing him a valuable asset of Islam, a great figure of Iran, a brave guide of the Islamic Revolution and a wise, unparalleled figure of the state. President Rouhani's full message is as follows: In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful "We are from Allah, and to Him we shall return" "And there is the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure of Allah: And Allah is full of kindness to (His) devotees" (Holy Quran) In the days of H. H. Fatemeh Ma'sumeh's (SA) mourning and Amir Kabir's sad martyrdom, Iran sat mourning for its worthy commander and the national hero in fighting tyranny and colonisation went to meet his maker. Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was Rouhollah [Khomeini]'s steadfast son, long-standing companion of the leader, distinguished and history-making figure of Islamic Revolution and somebody who was truly sympathetic towards people. How meaningful it was in history that the legend of faith, patience, tolerance and moderation passed away on the very day that people's uprising in defending the great Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Revolution. Taking about Hashemi, whom I was beside for many years, is very difficult. He was a perfect example of a revolution-backer during the Iranian nation's fight under the leadership of late Imam. Years of prison and torture did not separate him from that path. He always was one of the distinguished forerunners of the Islamic Revolution. It was him who never left Imam alone from Qom to Najaf, and from Paris to Tehran. Hashemi is among the distinguished architects of the Islamic Republic of Iran; the Constitution, the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Assembly of Experts of Leadership, the Presidency, the Expediency Discernment Council of the System, the Islamic Republic Party, the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, the Construction Jihad and all institutions of the Islamic Revolution are indebted to this man of future and his wisdom and foresight. Today, Islam lost a valuable asset; Iran a great figure; Islamic Revolution a brave guide; the state a wise, unparalleled figure. He was loved by Imam [Khomeini] and a servant to people. Wherever he was responsible for, he was a source of serenity for Imam, the leader and the people. He was a capable analyst and knew the world well. His sermons during the hard times of the Sacred Defence filled people with tremendous spirit. In being subject to persecution, he was like his old companion, martyr Ayatollah Beheshti, easily enduring ingratitude. Hashemi never feared war and always sought peace; he was both a courageous commander of Jihad and martyrdom, and the hero of negotiation for ending the war. Talking about a man who truly was the foundation of state is not easy. He was Imam's confidant and the Supreme Leader's incomparable companion. He had lofty wishes for Iran and Iranians and made tireless efforts for the pride of our Islamic homeland until the last moment of his life. He was subject to unkindness and showed loyalty. He did not agree with deviating from the path of moderate Islam and considered the expediency of the system above all things. The understanding people of Iran are grateful of their servants and will pay their debts to the Commander of Construction. Hashemi's name is so great that nobody can deny his effective role in every page of the history of the Islamic Movement from the first campaigns in the 1340s until the victory of the revolution and from his incomparable and excelling history in managing the country through the Sacred Defence era to all critical points until the last minutes of his life and his eternal life in the hearts of the grateful people of Iran. As our old and beloved Khomeini said once: "The hostiles should know that Hashemi is alive because the movement is alive".  I therefore, announce 3 days of public mourning and a day of public holiday and express my sincerest condolences over the loss of the great national hero, Islamic intellectual and incomparable asset of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Imam Mahdi (AS), the Supreme Leader, great Maraji, scholars and clerics, prominent figures of the revolution and the state, the grateful Iranian nation, especially the noble people of Kerman province and Rafsanjan town, all his companions and followers, especially his respectful family, his patient wife and also his children and brothers, praying to the Almighty for the great man's mercy and highest places before Him, as well as sitting close to the Immaculate Imams (AS) and his companion, Imam Khomeini (RA), his comrades and martyrs of the Islamic Revolution and all people.
