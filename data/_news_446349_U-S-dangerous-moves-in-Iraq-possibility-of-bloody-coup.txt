A member of the Iraqi Parliament Mohammad Albeldawi referred to this issue and maintained that based on evidence, the US seeks to orchestrate a coup in Iraq by activating ISIS in the Iraqi Governorates of Nineveh, Saladin, and Diyala. According to the Iraqi MP, what is currently being reported in the media affiliated with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf is a beginning for the US Plot. Moreover, US efforts to pressure the Iraqi government to release ISIS prisoners with the excuse of coronavirus outbreak is considered another proof. Meanwhile, a Kuwaiti newspaper quoted an informed source on Sunday saying that the US is planning a military coup in Iraq to seize power and it has informed its allies in Baghdad. Alquds Alarabi Newspaper also quoted a special source and noted, “The upcoming attacks against US troops prompted them to withdraw from some of their bases and focus on special ones. These forces have not fully withdrawn and have left some military advisors behind.” “There is no evidence that US troops are leaving Iraq because heavy equipment and weapons are brought daily into the country and we notice the presence of Special Forces. The US seeks to protect its forces by deploying the Patriot Missile Defense System. Currently, their focus is on Iraq and they intend to increase their troops in western Iraq, Kurdistan Region, and Baghdad.” The source added. It is clear that Iraq will have a difficult time in the coming weeks and months, especially as the political situation is not stable in the country and Adnan al-Zurufi is facing numerous challenges to form his cabinet.
