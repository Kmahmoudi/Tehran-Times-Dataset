TEHRAN- South Pars Gas Complex (SPGC) plans to increase production of gas by seven billion cubic meters (bcm) in the current Iranian calendar year (which began on March 21, 2019), the managing director of company announced. According to the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC), Hadi Hashemizadeh Farhang said the boost is expected to be made possible by precise and targeted planning for reduction of overhaul time in the refineries during summer, Shana reported. SPGC owns onshore refineries that process natural gas received from phases of the supergiant South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf. He said based on the plans, overhaul time of the facilities are expected to decrease by 27 days this year. The huge field, which Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, covers an area of 9,700 square kilometers, 3,700 square kilometers of which, called South Pars, are in Iran’s territorial waters. The remaining 6,000 square kilometers, called North Dome, are situated in Qatar’s territorial waters. South Pars is divided into 24 standard phases of development in the first stage. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment. MA/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
