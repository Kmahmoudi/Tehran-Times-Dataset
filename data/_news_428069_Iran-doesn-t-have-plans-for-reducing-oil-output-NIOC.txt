TEHRAN - National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) doesn’t have any plan for reducing oil output and will continue production at its full capacity, NIOC’s Managing Director Ali Kardor said on Sunday. The official noted that NIOC is accessing all its revenues and oil incomes have even increased compared to last year, Tasnim news agency reported.
