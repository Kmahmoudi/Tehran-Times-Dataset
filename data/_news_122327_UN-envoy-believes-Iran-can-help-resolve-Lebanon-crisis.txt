In an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC, Roed-Larsen said the UN secretary general is adamant that all regional countries notably Iran and Syria should be invited to cooperate with the UN to resolve the crisis. Without participation of the two nations, achieving a cease-fire will be very difficult and for this reason Kofi Annan is in contact with all sides specially Iran and Syria, Larsen underlined. He also expressed hope that the situation will allow the UN peace keeping force United Nation Interim Force for Lebanon - UNIFIL - to be deployed quickly in the area between Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories. Currently it appears that neither Israel nor Hezbollah is interested in accepting a speedy cease-fire and both sides are uttering statements in favor of continuation of the hostilities, the UN envoy said. He also said "establishing an immediate cease-fire needs a firm political underpinning to create adequate incentives." He stressed on the immediate dispatch of humanitarian relief to the affected Lebanese under the barrage of Zionist artillery and the need for creating grounds for deployment of a unilateral force under the auspices of the UN. Responding to a question on the form that a security zone between Lebanon and Israel will take, he added "it is too early to answer such a question although it appears that Israel is trying to establish a blue line with its border with Lebanon." The main issue is to find a way for the Lebanese army - and international force who could be called upon to help - to deploy in order to control the area without any violence. "Our hope is that Israel would withdraw from the occupied territories." He further warned on the deteriorating situation of the area saying that those who oppose a cease-fire could worsen the crisis and jeopardize the security of the whole region The Zionist regime which has killed or injured hundreds of the innocent Lebanese civilians and made many more homeless opposes a cease-fire. Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said here Friday the UN Security Council has so far failed to fulfill its main duty in supporting the Palestinian and Lebanese people in the face of Zionist regime's brutal attacks. The Security Council failed because a hegemonic power is dominating over it, he told reporters at a press conference. "The UNSC was unable even to establish a cease-fire in the region. We believe all these shortcomings stem from the domination of a hegemonic power over the Security Council, which dictates its will to others." Mottaki was talking to reporters after five foreign ministers of the group of Eight Developing Islamic countries -- Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia and Iran-- issued a statement on the ongoing developments in the Middle East in general, in Lebanon in particular. Foreign ministers of Group Five, in their statement, expressed their deep concern over deterioration of situation and escalation of tension in the occupied Palestinian lands and Lebanon. Mottaki said, "We expect the Security Council to recognize the Zionist regime as responsible for all the crimes and damage committed in Lebanon and Palestine and put in force an immediate cease-fire." He added Iran's stance is based on full cooperation with the international community to settle the crisis in Lebanon. However, he said, "A collective will is needed to materialize this goal." "Islamic states will do their utmost to resolve the case. Iran, as a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), will do its best to help settle the dispute in Lebanon with all its power."
