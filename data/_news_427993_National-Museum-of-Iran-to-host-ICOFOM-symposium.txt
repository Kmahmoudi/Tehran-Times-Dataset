TEHRAN – The National Museum of Iran will play host to the 41st annual symposium of ICOFOM -- International Committee for Museology – from October 15 – 19. A host of Iranian and foreign experts and academia have been invited to deliver speech at the event, which will revolve around “Museology and the Sacred” as its major theme. Officially known as the ICOFOM Annual Meeting, the symposium is to create a worldwide forum for a high level discussion on various musicological topics. The ICOFOM was founded in 1977 at the initiative of Jan Jelinek, in order to promote research and theoretical thinking within the museum world. It addresses the study of the theoretical foundation that guides museum activities around the world or, more generally, the analysis of the different forms that museums can take. Some Three million historical objects are being kept in Iran’s museums which are affiliated with the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization. CHHTO-affiliated museums hosted 19 million visitors during the past Iranian calendar year (ended March 20). There are some 600 heritage museums across the country, some half of which are associated with private collectors or various institutions, according to Mohammadreza Kargar who presides over CHHTO’s Museums and Historical Moveable Properties Office.
