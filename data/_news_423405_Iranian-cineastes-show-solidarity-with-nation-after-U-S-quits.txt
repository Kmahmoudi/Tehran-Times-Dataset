 “The world is witnessing a strange and difficult time that has begun in the wake of disorders caused by ignorance and disloyalty to agreements,” the house wrote in a statement published on Wednesday. “Under the shadow of national authority and the long history of art and culture, Iranian cinema and its cineastes with all their international honors will stand beside the great nation of Iran to defend their reputation,” the statement added.       Trump pulled the United States out of the deal worked out in 2015 by the United States, five other world powers and Iran.
