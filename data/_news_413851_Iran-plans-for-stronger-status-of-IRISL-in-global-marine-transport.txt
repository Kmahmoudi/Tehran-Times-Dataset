TEHRAN- Given removal of sanctions against Iran, the government plans for more strengthening of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) in the world’s marine transportation, IRNA reported on Sunday quoting Mohammad Baqer Nobakht, the government spokesman as well as head of the Management and Planning Organization, as saying. IRISL has resumed its routes to various destinations across Europe in the post-sanction time, IRISL managing director Mohammad Saeedi said last April. The sanctions barred IRISL fleet of about 170 vessels from sailing in international waters. They also prohibited international shipping companies from calling on Iranian ports.   International shipping lines have been stepping up port calls to Iran as the country’s massive maritime trade sector emerged from sanctions.    MA/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
