TEHRAN – Iran’s Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said on Sunday that Arbaeen pilgrims have been using the Mehran, Shalamcheh, and Chazzabeh border crossings to travel to Iraq in full security. Alavi said more than two million people have crossed the country’s border into Iraq to attend the Arbaeen pilgrimage, ISNA reported. Arbaeen marks the 40th day following Ashura, the 10th day of the lunar month of Muharram, when Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad and the third Shia Imam, was martyred.
