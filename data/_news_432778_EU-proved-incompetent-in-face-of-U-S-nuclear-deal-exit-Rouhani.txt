 Speaking to foreign envoys in Tehran on Wednesday on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, Rouhani said by quitting the deal, the U.S. complicated situations not only for Iran, but for the region and the larger world. “In these years we showed that we are very meticulous in signing a commitment, but stand faithful to it. The JCPOA is a symbol of Iran’s commitment to international treaties,” he said, adding, “We upheld our commitments more thoroughly than the other parties.” “We have created security in a volatile region.”The president then referred to Washington’s Iran policy and said, “America has always faced defeat in its plots, including disintegration, coup d’etat, war, and sanctions on the Islamic Republic.” The president added, “Even if America abandons its wrong path, apologizes for the past interference, and talks respectfully to our nation, we are prepared to accept their repentance.” Underlining that the Iranian nation relied on its domestic capabilities to withstand war, terrorism, and sanctions, Rouhani said, “We have created security in a volatile region.” “Those who created al-Qaeda and Daesh planned to create a fake Islamic revolution. But they realized their big mistake.”  SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
