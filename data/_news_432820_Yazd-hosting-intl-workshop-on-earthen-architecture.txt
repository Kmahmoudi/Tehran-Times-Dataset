Titled “First International Workshop on Earthen Architecture, World Heritage City of Yazd: Conservation Problems and Challenges”, the one-week event opened on February 10, and is being held in the cities of Yazd and Fahraj, both in central Yazd province, IRNA reported. Amongst instructors of the workshop are Finnish architect and urban planner Jukka Jokilehto, Mariana Correia, an International Consultant in World Heritage for the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) as well as Thierry Joffroy, an architect, researcher and President of the International Centre for Earth Construction. Attendees are also exchanging views about conservation and restoration approaches towards adobe architecture. Further recognition of earthen architecture values is other objective set for the event. Dominated by abundant badgirs (wind catchers), mud-brick houses, atmospheric alleyways and centuries of history, Yazd is a delightful place to stay, referring as a ‘don't miss’ destination by almost all travel associates in the region. A UNESCO World Heritage, the oasis city is wedged between the northern Dasht-e Kavir and southern Dasht-e Lut on a flat plain ringed by mountains.
