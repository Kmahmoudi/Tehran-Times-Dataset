TEHRAN –Iran and Oman launched their fourth direct shipping route to connect Iran’s port city of Jask to the Omani port of Al Suwaiq, the portal of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) reported on Wednesday citing Iran-Oman Joint Chamber of Commerce. The first shipping route between the two countries was put into operation in March 2015 between Iran’s Bandar Abbas and Oman’s Sohar.

With this new shipping line launched, more Iranian goods and agricultural products will be shipped to Oman.
