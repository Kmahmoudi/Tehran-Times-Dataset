TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry has censured a new series of Saudi bombings of residential areas and civilians in Yemen, urging international reaction to “such crimes against humanity”.

 In comments late on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi deplored inaction by the UN Security Council and the organizations claiming to be advocates of human rights on the Saudi crimes against Yemeni people, saying such muted response has encouraged the Riyadh regime to continue devastating the Yemeni infrastructure, killing civilians and keeping a blockade on the country which is in need of humanitarian aid. Qassemi also called on the UN and those arming the Saudi military to take effective steps to end the attacks on Yemen and ensure the safety of civilians, particularly women and children. SP/PA
