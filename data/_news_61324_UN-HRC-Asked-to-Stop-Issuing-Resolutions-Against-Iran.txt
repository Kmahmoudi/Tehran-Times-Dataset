Pointing to the rapid changes that have occurred in Iran, and the positive remarks made by many countries in this regard, he said, "Many of the members of the commission, such as the members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and the 17-member LMG (Like Minded Group) from Asia, Africa and Latin America, have called for the special monitoring of human rights in Iran to be stopped, and called it unfair." Khorram added that Iran is going through considerable changes which special UN observer Maurice Capithorne has pointed out in his report and that the European Union has also confirmed this. However, the EU has suggested the issuance of another resolution against Iran, based on some isolated incidents. The European Union has ignored the fact that Iran is undergoing social and political changes and is proceeding step by step. The changes are based on the strong decision of the people and the leader of the revolution, as well as the endeavors of government branches to reform and develop human rights in Iran. He further said that the special UN observer on human rights, Maurice Capithorne, has traveled to Iran three times. Khorram added that Iran would welcome his future visits to Iran if the EU shows its readiness to stop special monitoring of human rights in Iran and to cooperate with Iran on human rights issues. Khorram pointed out the active participation of Iran in the programs of the UN Human Rights Commission, which includes finding fields for technical cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. He reiterated that the official in charge of the UN Human Rights Commission traveled to Iran last month and visited the human rights center of Tehran University.
