TEHRAN – Russia’s special envoy on Syria Alexander Lavrentiev has conveyed an important message to Iranian officials, Ali Akbar Velayati, the Iranian Supreme Leader’s senior advisor, said on Saturday. Lavrentiev was in Tehran to convey a very important message, Velayati said without elaborating.
“Today, we see hope-inspiring advance on the ground in Syria by Syrian forces and according to Lavrentiev’s report, government forces are advancing from the west to east of Aleppo. This is a great achievement in pinning terrorists into the city quarters,” said Velayati.
During the meeting the two sides agreed that Syrian army and government as well as Iranian and Russian allies and Hezbollah will continue the fight until Aleppo city is fully liberated, he added.
