TEHRAN – The mission of the Iranian ambassador to Berlin officially came to an end on Saturday, Mehr reported. Speaking at his farewell ceremony, Ali Majedi called on all Iranian officials to spare no efforts in serving their country. It comes as part of a parliamentary legislation that bans the employment of retirees. The rule also applies to Iran’s ambassadors to Turkey and the United Nations in New York who resigned their posts on Friday. All Iranians whose employment status meets the conditions stipulated in this law are required to submit their resignations by November 17.
