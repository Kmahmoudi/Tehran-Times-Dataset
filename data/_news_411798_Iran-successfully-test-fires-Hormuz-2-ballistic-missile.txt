A top Iranian commander confirmed on Thursday the Islamic Republic has successfully test-fired Hormuz-2 ballistic missile. Iran "fired Hormuz-2 this week and the missile successfully destroyed a target at a distance of 250 kilometers,” commander of the Aerospace Division of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh said Thursday.    Hormuz-2 is a naval strike ballistic missile that can hit mobile targets at sea with high precision. It has a range of almost 300 kilometers. The missile is very similar to anti-ship Khalij-e-Fars (Persian Gulf) ballistic missile in appearance. On Monday, Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan warned that Iran’s defensive military power would catch the enemies off guard in the event of an aggression against the Islamic Republic. The warning came one day after Iran successfully tested the S-300 surface-to-air missile defense system, which the Islamic Republic has purchased from Russia. Following the test, Brigadier General Farzad Esmaili, the commander of Iran’s Khatam al-Anbiya Air Defense Base, said the country was designing and manufacturing an indigenous version of the S-300 system, called Bavar-373.
