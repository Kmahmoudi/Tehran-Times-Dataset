Hemmati, for his part, emphasized the need for expansion of the banking and financial relations between the two countries, saying “Despite the efforts made by the United States to cut Iran’s banking and financial relations with the world, several countries have offered various solutions to maintain and develop their banking relations with Iran.” Hemmati further noted that the U.S. has failed to realize their intended impacts on Iran’s economy.
