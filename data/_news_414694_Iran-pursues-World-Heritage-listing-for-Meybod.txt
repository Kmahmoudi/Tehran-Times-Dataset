TEHRAN – The Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization is following up on possible inscription of the central city of Meybod, Yazd province, and its cultural landscape on the UNESCO World Heritage list by 2020. “We are going to compile a dossier on the historical city in the near future for [potential] UNESCO inscription in 2020,” said Fatemeh Danesh-Yazdi who presides over the provincial CHTHO department.

It is home to some historical mosques, caravanserais, mansions, with the pre-Islamic Narin Castle amongst one of the most celebrated.  Iran expects to reap a bonanza from its numerous natural beauties and historical sites, including 21 ones that have been inscribed on the UNESCO list.
