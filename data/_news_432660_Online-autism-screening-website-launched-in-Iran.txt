TEHRAN — Iran’s Welfare Organization launched an online autism screening website on Monday, ISNA news agency reported. 
 Parents with children aged 2 to 5 years can refer to the website and answer to 10 online questions, the Organization director Vahid Qobadi-Dana said. By answering the questions parents will be informed weather their children are likely to have autism or not, Qobadi-Dana explained, adding that children who are susceptible to autism will be referred to nearest welfare offices to confirm the disorder.  In May 2018, Afrouz Saffari-far, an official with Welfare Organization, said that online screening helps in diagnosing the disease in children and providing subsequent rehabilitating services. She also stated that estimations show that 1 percent of Iranian children suffer autism.  According to the World Health Organization autism spectrum disorders refers to a range of conditions characterized by some degree of impaired social behavior, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively. Individuals with autism often present other co-occurring conditions, including epilepsy, depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The level of intellectual functioning in individuals with ASDs is extremely variable, extending from profound impairment to superior levels. It is important that, once identified, children with an ASD and their families are offered relevant information, services, referrals, and practical support according to their individual needs. A cure for ASD is not available. Evidence-based psychosocial interventions, however, such as behavioral treatment and skills training programmes for parents and other caregivers, can reduce difficulties in communication and social behavior, with a positive impact on the person’s wellbeing and quality of life. According to priorygroup.com, it is so important to diagnose autism, as without a diagnosis this can make so many areas of life difficult, distressing and bewildering for the undiagnosed person. This can result in difficult behaviors and social isolation and young people who do not attain their best ability in school.  Once diagnosed, the young person can understand themselves better and realize that are not alone in the way they feel. Their parents and the professionals working with them can all learn how best to help them. The right services can be accessed and adaptions can be put into place in the educational setting.  A diagnosis can prevent so much distress as the child develops and can stop further psychiatric illnesses developing. Some young people with ASD do benefit from medication to help with anxiety or low mood or to help manage some behaviors.
