TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Velayati, a top foreign policy adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump disrespected other members of the 5+1 group by pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal.
 Talking to reporters after a meeting with Turkmen Foreign Minister Rasit Meredow in Tehran, Velayati said the U.S. proved that it cannot be trusted.   In a declaration on Tuesday, Trump officially withdrew the United States from the nuclear pact and said he will reinstate economic sanctions on Iran. The nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was signed in July 2015 between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It went into force in January 2016.   Velayati, a veteran politician who served as Iran’s foreign minister in the 1980s and 1990s, noted that Europe will be discredited if it accompanies the U.S. in this respect.
