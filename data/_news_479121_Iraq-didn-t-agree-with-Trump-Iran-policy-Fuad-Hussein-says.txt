TEHRAN – Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein has said that Baghdad was not content with the White House Iran policy under former U.S. President Donald Trump.  “The tensions that existed in the region between Iran and America under former President Donald Trump were reflected in the Iraqi arena, and we were not with Trump's policy and did not support his decisions. Consequently, the tensions between Washington and Tehran during Trump's tenure moved to the Iraqi arena,” Hussein said.  The Iraqi foreign minister made the remarks in an interview with the Bahraini Al Watan newspaper.  Hussein pointed out Iraq’s endeavor to restore relations between neighboring countries in order to ensure the security of the region, noting that collective security in the region reflects positively on the security situation inside his country. He also praised the strength of Iran-Iraq relations.  “Our relations with neighboring Iran are strong, and we, in fact, through many times, seek to restore Iranian-[Persian] Gulf relations because this is in the interest of Iraq, because whenever there is security in the region, the collective security in the region reflects positively on the security situation inside Iraq, so we seek to restore relations between neighboring countries,” he said. “In this context, the first Baghdad conference was held, and the second version of the Baghdad conference will be held in Jordan.” Responding to a question on Iraq’s mediatory efforts in the region, Hussein referred to Baghdad’s mediation between Iran and Saudi Arabia. “Iraqi efforts are known, and there have been meetings between Saudi Arabia and Iran through Iraqi efforts, and if the two capitals are ready to sit again, we are ready to help,” he noted.  The Iraqi foreign minister added, “We are trying to create a specific situation to reach calm in the region for the benefit of all, because the tensions in the region are reflected in the internal conditions, and therefore internal security is related to security and the regional security situation. That is why we seek to create a good regional security situation to be reflected in the security situation in these countries, including Iraq, of course.” Iraqi media reported Saturday that new Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Sudani will pay a visit to Iran on Monday for the first time in his capacity as Iraq’s premier.  This will be the prime minister’s third foreign visit after recent trips to Jordan and Kuwait.  But Qassem al-Araji, Iraq’s national security advisor, said the visit will take place on Tuesday. On Saturday, Iranian Ambassador to Iraq Mohammad Kazem Al Sadeq met with the Iraqi prime minister. “The meeting dealt with discussing a number of common issues in the economic and investment aspects, and it was also emphasized that the meetings between Iraq and Iran will continue in the security issue, in a manner that preserves the sovereignty of the two countries, achieves the interests of the two friendly peoples, and consolidates the security and stability of the region,” a statement by the Iraqi prime minister’s office said.  During the meeting, the Iranian ambassador conveyed the invitation of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to the Iraqi prime minister to visit Iran.  Last week on Monday, Al Sadeq met with Qassem al-Araji, Iraq’s national security advisor. In the meeting, the two sides discussed the political and security situation in the region and the world, Iraqi News Agency reported.  Al-Araji discussed with the Iranian ambassador the relations between the two countries and ways to develop them, in a way that serves the common interests of the two friendly countries and peoples, INA added. It continued that Al-Araji clarified that "the Iraqi government is working to achieve balance in its relations with countries, and distances itself from the policy of axes." The Iraqi security official also noted that "Iraq is always looking forward to stability in the region, security, political and economic, to serve the peoples and countries of the region and the world." The Iranian ambassador also underlined Iran’s support for the success of the administration of Iraq’s new prime minister Mohammad al-Sudani. Al Sadeq also stressed Iran’s support for cooperation in the field of electricity, gas and energy. He pointed out that "the al-Sudani administration has the ingredients for success, the advancement of the country, and the provision of services."    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
