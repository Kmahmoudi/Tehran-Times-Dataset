TEHRAN - Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force, has confirmed that Iran has recently test-fired a missile, saying that the country tests tens of missiles annually.

 “We test our missiles and the recent test was important too,” Hajizadeh told Fars in an interview published on Tuesday. Asked about U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s reaction to the missile test, the general said, “Americans’ reaction shows that this test has been very important and caused them to make a hue and cry.”  General Hajizadeh said that Iran tests over 40 to 50 missiles every year but the fact that the U.S. react to some of these tests is that it has made them feel uneasy. He did not mention the name of the missile that Iran test-fired recently. Earlier this month, Pompeo had said Iran tested a medium-range ballistic missile, claiming that it was a violation of the UN Security Council resolution 2231. Zarif: Iran’s missile program not prohibited by UN resolution Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif underscored that the resolution 2231 has not prohibited Iran’s missile activities. “I can make it clear as the foreign minister that the issue of missiles has never been subject to negotiations and that in resolution 2231 nothing has been approved or ratified about its prohibition for the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Zarif told Tasnim on Tuesday. “Our defense doctrine is basically founded upon deterrence and is defensive, not offensive,” the top diplomat underlined, saying the Islamic Republic of Iran has proved its commitment to such a doctrine throughout its history. Resolution 2231 calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” Iranian officials have time and again underscored that none of the country’s missiles have been designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads, because nuclear weapons have basically no place in Iran’s defense doctrine.
