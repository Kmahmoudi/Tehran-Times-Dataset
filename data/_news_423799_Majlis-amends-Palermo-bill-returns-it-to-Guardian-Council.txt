TEHRAN - Yahya Kamalipour, a member of the Majlis Judicial and Legal Committee, said on Sunday that Majlis has made some amendments to the Palermo bill and sent it back to the Guardian Council for final approval.
 He said that there were some mistakes in translation of the Palermo bill which has been corrected. Back in January, the parliament passed the Palermo bill in order to join the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC).
