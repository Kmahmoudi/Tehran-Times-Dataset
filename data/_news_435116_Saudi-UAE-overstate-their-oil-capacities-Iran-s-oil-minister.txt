The comments were in reaction to expectations the two countries would fill any supply gap caused by a tightening of U.S. oil sanctions on Iran. The U.S. behavior and its oil sanctions against Iran are not a bluff, but these are signs of Washington’s “very violent hostility toward the Iranian nation,” Zanganeh stated. “The U.S. behavior and oil sanctions are not a bluff, but (the result of) very violent hostility toward the Iranian nation,” Zanganeh was quoted by IRNA as saying.
