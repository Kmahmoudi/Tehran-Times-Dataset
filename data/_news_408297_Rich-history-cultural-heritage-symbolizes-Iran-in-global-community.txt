TEHRAN – The newly appointed director of the Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization has said that Iran’s rich history and cultural heritage symbolizes the country in the global community. “Lively and deeply-rooted-in-time cultural heritage and civilization is the brand Iran is famous for worldwide,” Zahra Ahmadipour said during her inauguration ceremony on Sunday. “Such cultural capital is a factor that interconnects Iranian generations and preserves their national identity,” she added. The ceremony was attended by First Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri and Research Institute for Cultural Heritage and Tourism Director Mohammad Beheshti amongst several other officials. Zahra Ahmadipour, who doubles as vice president, holds a PhD in geopolitics, an MS in geography and urban planning as well as a BS in geography. Her appointment came after former CHTHO head, Masoud Soltanifar, became the new Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs by winning a vote of confidence from Majlis on November 1. Ahmadipour has been also an assistant professor in geography at Tehran’s Tarbiat Modarres University and the director general of the Interior Ministry’s administrative division office.
