TEHRAN -- Asghar Farhadi’s acclaimed film “The Salesman” has won the best film award at the 5th Persian International Film Festival in Australia. The film was the opening film of the event, which was held in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra from September 22 to October 3. The movie is about Emad and Rana, a young couple living in Tehran, who are forced to move into a new apartment after their old flat is damaged. However, an incident linked to the previous tenant dramatically changes the couple’s life. The movie won the Palme d’Or for screenplay at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. It also brought Shahab Hosseini the Palme d’Or for best actor. “The Salesman” is Iran’s submission to the 89th Academy Awards in the best foreign-language film category. “500 Ounces of Gold” by Shahrzad Dadgar was crowned best short film by the jury composed of photographer Sue Murray, cartoonist Martin Brown, Australian director and cinematographer Ray Argall and French producer Helen Panckhurst. The organizers also paid tribute to the world-renowned Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami by screening a number his films. Photo: A scene from “The Salesman” MMS/YAW
