The Iranian ambassador to France has said the U.S., as party to the multilateral July 2015 nuclear deal, has changed its way and “swims against the current”.

 Fortunately, the other sides including France have been committed to the deal and declared there is no way to change the JCPOA, Abolqasem Delfi said in an interview with France 3, the second largest television French channel. The nuclear deal has been the basis for fulfilling economic agreements, Delfi said. U.S. President Donald Trump has said that he will withdraw from the deal if changes are not made to it. But top Iranian officials have repeatedly said that the nuclear agreement is nonnegotiable. Tuning to Tehran-Paris ties, Delfi said Iran and France enjoy peaceful and growing relations that are based on mutual respect.  Also referring to the January 2016 visit of the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to France, Delfi said the visit prepared the ground for bilateral cooperation in political, cultural and economic areas.
