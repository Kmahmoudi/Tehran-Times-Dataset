ST PETERSBURG, Russia – Iran national football team coach Carlos Queiroz has hit out at critics after win over Morocco in their World Cup opener. Team Melli edged past Morocco in Group B thanks to an injury time goal from Aziz Bouhaddouz. “It was a tough match and I think Morocco didn’t expect a great performance by Iran. We won a beautiful match.  Iran defeated a wonderful team Morocco,” Queiroz said in the post-match news conference.   “We defeated Morocco after our players made many sacrifices. We dedicate this win to really fans of the national team. We dedicate this win to those ones who really supported the team, not those ones who jeopardize and pretend to support the team,” he added. Asked him if they have a chance to qualify for the next stage, Queiroz said, “We are together and united. We must work together. We have our strength and limitation. It’s what we have done for eight years.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
