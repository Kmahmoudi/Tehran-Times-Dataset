TEHRAN - Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an Iranian lawmaker, has said that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s claim that sanctions are aimed at giving the Iranian people a chance to have better lives is “invalid” and “disgraceful”.
 “It is obvious that these remarks are disgraceful and have no value,” ISNA quoted him as saying on Wednesday. In an interview with Newsmax TV on January 3, Pompeo said, “The sanctions on Iran have this ultimate goal: creating an outcome where the Iranian people can have better lives than they have today.” NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
