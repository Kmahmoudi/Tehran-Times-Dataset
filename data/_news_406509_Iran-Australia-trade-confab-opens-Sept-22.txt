TEHRAN - Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mine, and Agriculture (ICCIMA) will host Iran-Australia trade conference on Wednesday, September 22, ICCIMA’s website reported on Sunday. Australia’s Trade Minister Steven Ciobo will lead an economic delegation to the event which will be also attended by ICCIMA chairman Gholamhossein Shafei and some Iranian traders and entrepreneurs. The Australian delegation is comprised of businessmen active in various areas such as energy, education, commercial services, mining, agricultural products, foodstuff, health services, finance, banking, water management, and technical and engineering services.  Australian resources and agricultural businesses are getting more access into Iran after the government said it plans to reopen a trade office there later this year following meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Canberra in mid-March. At that time, Ciobo who was a spokesman for Australian Trade Ministry, said “Austrade, the Australian government’s trade, investment and education promotion agency, will provide support to Australian businesses immediately from its office in Dubai and will establish a permanent presence within the Australian Embassy in Tehran from the second half of 2016”. “The recent lifting of sanctions has created opportunities for Australian business in areas we excel: mining equipment, technology and services sectors and the supply of our agricultural commodities such as barley and wheat,” Ciobo added, “Austrade has also identified opportunities for commercial cooperation in the health and medical and education and skills training sectors.” HJ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
