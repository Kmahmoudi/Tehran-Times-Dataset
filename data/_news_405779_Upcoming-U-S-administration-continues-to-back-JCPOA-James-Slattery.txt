TEHRAN – Ever since July 2015 when Iran and six world powers of the U.S., China, Russia, England, France, and Germany, reached an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program, speculations have been around about the future of the pact now that the end of the Obama administration is nearing in January.  While some have been pessimistic, others, including James Charles Slattery, former U.S. congressman, have been optimistic toward the fate of the deal.  
“I believe both candidates will comply with the JCPOA assuming Iran continues to comply,” Slattery, told the Tehran Times.
Iran has been complaining that that the pace of removing financial and economic sanctions under the deal has been slow. Some major banks are still hesitant to do transactions with Iran, fearing punishment by the U.S. Treasury.
Some hardliners in the Congress have been trying to kill the deal. Even Donald Trump has promised to tear apart the deal if he becomes president.
However, Slattery notes, “All western allies support the JCPOA. They know it is better than any other alternative to date.  I believe our allies will act together in unity.” 
This is the text of the interview:
Q: What is your prediction about the future of the Joint comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)?
A: I believe Hillary Clinton is going to win the upcoming election. I put her chances at about 75 percent.
She will honor the deal that President Obama has negotiated. She realizes the JCPOA is not perfect. Both sides had to compromise to get a deal. She understands that Iran has complied with its obligations under the JCPOA and the U.S. must do the same.
I hope both sides comply with the terms of the JCPOA. It is mutually beneficial.
Both sides must not forget that more than 35 years of mistrust and animosity cannot be washed away in a few months. Trust must be restored and both sides should work to this end.
All opportunities to have dialogue on cultural, religious, academic, athletic, agricultural business and political Issues should be pursued.
Men and women who favor a peaceful path forward in Iran must be heard.
Hardliners in the U.S., Israel and even in Iran oppose the JCPOA and find themselves on the same side.  This is amazing.
I believe the JCPOA will be supported by the next administration.
Q: Do you think the next U.S. president will remain committed to the JCPOA?
A: I believe both candidates will comply with the JCPOA assuming Iran continues to comply. We must be patient.
Q: If it happens that the next U.S. president violates the JCPOA, will its allies support the violation?
A: All western allies support the JCPOA. They know it is better than any other alternative to date.  I believe our allies will act together in unity.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
