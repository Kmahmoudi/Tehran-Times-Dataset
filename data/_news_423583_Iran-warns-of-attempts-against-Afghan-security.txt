TEHRAN – Iranian First Vice-President Es'haq Jahangiri has warned of attempts by certain foreign countries to use Afghanistan as a platform to take revenge against others. “Unfortunately, certain countries want to turn Afghanistan into a ground to take revenge against others,” Jahangiri said in a meeting with Afghan Defense Minister General Tariq Shah Bahrami in Tehran on Monday. He further said that Iran is sensitive to this issue and believes that Afghanistan should not be used for this end, Fars reported. The first vice president added, “Relations between Afghanistan and the neighboring states should not be affected by [foreign] pressure because the interests of the Afghan people will be seriously damaged.”  Jahangiri also voiced Iran’s willingness to increase its mutual and international cooperation to boost security of Afghanistan.

Heading a military delegation, the Afghan defense minister has been in Tehran for military and political negotiations. During a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Brigadier General Amir Hatami, Bahrami expressed his gratitude to the Iranian people and government for their “unconditional support” for Afghanistan over the past 40 years and said the people of his country are always grateful for such support.      Hatami also emphasized that the expansion of bilateral relations with neighboring and friendly countries is among Iran’s goals.
