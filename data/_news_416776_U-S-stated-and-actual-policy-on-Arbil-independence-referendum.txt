Commenting on the U.S. incongruent policies toward Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, Nader Entessar says those in favour of creating an Independent Kurdish state count on U.S. support via Israel. Sep.25 referendum on Iraqi Kurdish independence brought up by the Iraqi Kurdistan region’s head (KRG), Masood Barezani not only violates Iraq’s constitution but also will further destabilize the region. While Iraqi central government, Iraq's neighbours, the U.S. and many other players has asked Masood Barezanis to withdraw from his destabilizing decision on holding independence referendum, he insists on his decision and says they will go ahead with the referendum on independence on Sept. 25 despite all these concerns. The U.S. State Department has stated that it is concerned that the referendum in northern Iraq will distract from “more urgent priorities” such as the defeat of Islamic State militants. For insistence of Arbil on independence referendum despite of all oppositions, only one reason could be imagined and it is “difference between stated and actual policy of the U.S.” Such a notion is not farfetched due to its destructive impact on the U.S. relation with Baghdad and its NATO alley, Turkey. To shed further light on the ongoing developments about the issue, Tehran Times reached out to Professor and Chair of Department of Political Science and Criminal Justice, University of South Alabama, Nader Entessar. Here is the full text of his interview: Q: Can we imagine that there is a difference between the U.S. stated policy and its actual policy on the ground? Yes, I think we should not be surprised if the stated U.S. policy and the actual policy on this issue prove to be incongruent with each other.  The U.S. does not have a carefully calibrated policy in the Middle East.  Today, Washington has moods and not well-articulated policies in the Middle East or many other parts of the world. Q: Despite of regional opposition, how far the U.S. will be able to support Arbil? How will the U.S. be able to manage its differences with its regional ally, Turkey on the issue? The U.S. will not be able to sustain its support for an independent Kurdish state without the support of some of its regional allies, especially Turkey. However, based on stated Turkish policies, Ankara will oppose the creation of an independent Kurdistan.   Besides, such a move by Washington will require a major redefinition of its relationship with Baghdad. However, those in favour of creating an Independent Kurdish state count on U.S. support via Israel, the only regional country that has supported the creation of an independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq. Q: Are there any legal ways to stop Arbil from its destabilizing decision on holding the independence referendum?  There are two major legal problems with holding the referendum as proposed by the KRG. First, the opponents of the referendum, including Barzani's Kurdish rivals, have stated that since Masoud Barzani's term as the president of Iraqi Kurdistan expired two years ago, he does not have the legal authority to decide on holding a referendum on the future of Kurdistan.  Second, constitutionally speaking, the decision to hold a referendum in Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region must be approved by the Kurdistan Regional Parliament. However, this body has not fully convened since October 2015, and no Kurdish parliament is functioning today.  Therefore, the Kurdish Regional Parliament cannot legally approve the holding of a referendum as proposed by Mr. Barzani.  However, these two legal obstacles have not prevented Barzani and the Kurdish Regional Government from going forward with the scheduled referendum on Kurdish independence.
