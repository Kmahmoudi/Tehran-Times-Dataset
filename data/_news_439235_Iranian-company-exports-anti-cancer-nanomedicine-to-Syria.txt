TEHRAN – An Iranian knowledge-based company has exported 3,000 vials of the anti-cancer nanomedicine, SinaDoxosome, to Syria, Mehr reported on Saturday. The nanomedicine is in the registration process in Armenia, Lebanon and Iraq, the managing director of the company Mahnaz Qomi said. The company plans to export the drug to other Asian and European countries like Oman, Thailand and Spain, she added. According to Nanotechnology Products Database, SinaDoxosome is used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and Kaposi sarcoma associated with AIDS; and it is also in clinical trial phase for some other cancers.
