THERAN_ As an indicator of worsening security situation in Indian controlled Kashmir, this month has been the deadliest so far this year with increase in casualties. According to reports, November has been the deadliest month in the Kashmir valley with 39 militants killed, the highest in comparison to previous months. One of those killed earlier this week was Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Naveed Jatt, who had been eluding security forces since few years. Jatt was alleged to be the mastermind of the attack that killed prominent Kashmiri journalist Shujaat Bukhari in July. The security forces have so far killed 233 militants this year, much higher than the total count of 213 last year. A report in Economic Times said security forces are expecting more action in the coming days, having received inputs on most of the terrorists being concentrated in certain areas of south and central Kashmir. Army Chief General Bipin Rawat while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event in Delhi on Wednesday, had said that the security forces are ‘one by one’ killing militants, who have been named as the top 12 most wanted ones in J&K and plans are afoot to finish their leadership. The report further stated that following Jatt’s killing, security forces are searching for Hizbul Mujahideen militant Zeenat-ul-Islam, the group’s chief operational commander in Kashmir, Riyaz Ahmad Naikoo, besides Zakir Musa of the group called the Ansar Ghazwat ul-Hind. The three are locals of Kashmir and have been categorised by the forces as ‘A++’ terrorists, which is the most notorious level.
