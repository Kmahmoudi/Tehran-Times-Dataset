Iranian state-run companies transferred 29.662 trillion rials (about $760.564 million) worth of their shares to the private sector in the past Iranian calendar year of 1394 (which ended on March 19), Tasnim reported in mid-April.
The country transferred 47.738 trillion rials (about $1.224 billion) worth of shares of state-run companies to the private sector in the calendar year of 1393, reportedly.

Under the present interpretation of the Article 44 of Iran's Constitution, hundreds of state-owned companies have been privatized.
Head of IPO Abdollah Pouri-Hosseini announced on October 15 that 200 state-run companies will be transferred to the private sector by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017).
