TEHRAN – In recent years Iranian security forces have thwarted acts of terror by more than 30 terrorist cells other than those plotted by Daesh, an official with the Intelligence Ministry said on Sunday. “More than 30 armed terrorist groups had plans to carry out measures over the past few years to make the country insecure and disturb the peace of the [Iranian] people,” the deputy intelligence minister for counter-terrorism said, Press TV reported.
