TEHRAN- On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Yisrael Lapid talked with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, amid outrage in Kyiv over the regime’s unwillingness to give armaments to Ukraine as it confronts Russia's invasion. Lapid called after Moscow allegedly utilized drones built by Iran to strike Ukraine and voiced "great worry about the military relations between Iran and Russia," according to his office.  Separately, in a TV interview Lapid claimed that Russia-Iran arms ties placed "the whole world in jeopardy". The regime’s premier stated that he "expressed with Kuleba our angst over the military relations between Iran and Russia," adding that "Israel stands with the Ukrainian people."  After the phone call, Lapid tweeted that Kuleba had given him an update on the conflict. In recent days Israeli War Minister Benny Gantz has reaffirmed several times that Tel Aviv “will not deploy weaponry to Ukraine”. He has also said Israel “will not supply weapon systems to Ukraine, due to a number of operational concerns." The deputy head of the Russian Security Council, Dmitri Medvedev, on Monday issued a warning to Israel on social media stating that any "reckless" transfer of military hardware to Ukraine "would ruin all interstate relations between our countries." Hossein Amir Abdollahian, the Foreign Minister of Iran, made it clear to Josep Borrell, the head of the European Union's foreign policy office, on Thursday that Iran does not support Russia's purchase of weapons for its conflict with Ukraine. In a phone conversation with Borrell, Amir Abdollahian stated, "We have defense cooperation with Russia, but our policy regarding the Ukraine war is to respect the territorial integrity of this country, not to deliver arms to the warring sides, to stop the war, and to end the displacement of people." The Islamic Republic of Iran's foreign minister highlighted that its foreign policy is grounded in "logic," "wisdom," and "diplomacy," adding that "Our foreign policy is not based on double-standards." Since the outbreak of the Russian “special military operations” on Ukraine, a multitude Western-backed media outlet have allegedly said that Iranian drones and ammunitions were used in the spate of strikes on Ukraine’s cities. Iranian authorities have frequently dismissed such fabricated claims, highlighting that Iran has invariably remained neutral in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. They said that Tehran has been a stalwart of peace and dialogue.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
