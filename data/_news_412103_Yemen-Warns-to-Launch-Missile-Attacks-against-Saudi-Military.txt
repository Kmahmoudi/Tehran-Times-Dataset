TEHRAN - Deputy Spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces Colonel Aziz Rashid warned that the Saudi bases, airports and ports in the Eastern region of Dammam would be the next target of Yemen's missiles. Rashid noted that the Yemeni ballistic missile attacks on Riyadh indicate the army and popular committees' high missile power, and said as long as the Saudi-led coalition pounds the Yemeni nation, ballistic missiles will be used against the Saudi targets. He also warned that in case Riyadh launches attacks against the ports in Yemen, the Yemeni army and popular committees would launch operations deep inside Saudi Arabia. His remarks came after the official spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces, Brigadier General Sharq Luqman, underlined that the country is in possession of advanced missiles which can hit the Saudi capital. "We have been able to develop our weapons and make progress so that they can hit the Saudi capital," Luqman told al-Mayadeen news channel on Monday. Noting that Borkan-2 missile was the first missile which could target King Salman airbase, he said that new missiles are underway. Luqman said that after hitting Riyadh, the war in Yemen will enter a new stage and all equations will change. Reports said earlier this month that Yemen's popular forces and their allies in the country's army fired a long-range ballistic missile at an airbase in the Saudi capital Riyadh, marking the second such attack on the city. The Borkan-2 missile accurately struck King Salman Air Base. In a statement carried by Yemen's official Saba news agency, a Yemeni military official close to the Ansarullah group said the missile attack came in retaliation for the criminal Saudi war on Yemen. Meanwhile, the Yemeni army pledged that missiles would target the Saudi territory until the regime’s bombing campaign stops.  It further announced that 108 ballistic missiles have been fired at positions held by Saudi invaders inside and outside Yemen so far. Separately, Yemeni popular fighters targeted with a Zelzal-1 missile a gathering place of Saudi mercenaries in the al-Ramzah district in the kingdom’s Southwestern Jizan region. They also launched a missile attack against positions held by the mercenaries in al-Maton district of Yemen’s Northern Jawf province.
