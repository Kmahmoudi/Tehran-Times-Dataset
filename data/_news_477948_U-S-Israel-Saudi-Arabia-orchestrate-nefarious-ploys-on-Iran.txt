TEHRAN - A top Iranian commander asserts that a trio of countries — the U.S., the Israeli regime, and Saudi Arabia — are responsible for the recent foreign-backed riots that have swept some cities in Iran. Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, the IRGC Navy commander, made the comments on Sunday during a comprehensive interview with Iran's Arabic-language television news network al-Alam. He added, “Our dear youths, who have been deceived into joining the riots should realize that foreigners, such as the United States, Israel, and, unfortunately, Saudi Arabia have formed a sinister triangle in this matter.” Protests erupted in Iran after Mahsa Amini, a young woman, died suddenly in the hospital three days after fainting in police custody. Extremist forces quickly diverted the rallies and converted them into violent disturbances. According to an official investigation that was released earlier this month, Amini's death was brought on by a disease as opposed to suspected strikes to the skull or other important body parts. Tangsiri stated that certain other nations have also been meddling in this crisis from a distance, such as Britain, fueling the fury of the folks.  He highlighted that London always seeks to get involved as soon as such issues come into existence. "All of this bears one message, and the message is that they want to tear off some sections of Iran," he said, pointing out how various separatist factions started attempting to take advantage of the circumstances. The commander downplayed attempts to foment discord and division across the nation, saying that the anarchist and separatist groups would only get to see the accomplishment of their objectives "in their dreams." "Such a thing would not happen as long as there is even only one Iranian warrior alive...only one person, who likes Iran's Revolution, Islam, and his or her country," he remarked.  The admiral added, "We have been compelled to confront more severe and profound problems during these years,", noting the riots "are not a major issue" in comparison to previous events since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. "The rioters and their supporters can damage us, but they can't wear us down,” he pointed out.  Tangrisi used the example of Iran's triumph in the 1980–88 conflict that Saddam Hussein, the former dictator of Iraq, had put on the Islamic Republic while enjoying the full support of the U.S. and its allies. He said that throughout the war, Iranian soldiers braved the American fleet in the Persian Gulf.  However, Tangsiri quoted Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei as saying that the Islamic Republic should continue to "enhance its growth" in order to "blind the adversary." By God's grace, he continued, "we are going to see development every day between the IRGC and the Army's forces."
