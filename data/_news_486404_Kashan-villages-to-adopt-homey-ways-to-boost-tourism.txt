TEHRAN – Plans to develop local leisure activities have been formulated to buttress eco-tourism in a selection of 21 rural villages in Kashan county of Isfahan province. In response to the high demand for the village products, experts seek to promote environment-friendly tourism based on a kind of homestay scheme as the model designed to attract city dwellers. Rural tourism development has somehow been neglected in Kashan and its surroundings, Kashan's tourism chief Ahmad Danaeinia said on Thursday. Kashan villages have a lot of potential for tourism development, he said. “Some of those villages have a unique historical context that may be registered in the national cultural heritage list.” To achieve our goals, we intend to promote rural areas in both national and international levels, the official said. Kashan is situated on a route that connects Tehran to the giant destinations of Isfahan, Shiraz, and Yazd. Moreover, the ancient town is a gateway to many sights, stories, and surrounding attractive villages to discover. Apart from centuries-old mansions, domed bazaars and impressive mosques, Kashan embraces some archaeological gems. Most importantly, the Tepe Sialk, which has yielded interesting pottery pieces, metal tools, and domestic implements made from stone, clay, and bone that date from as early as the 4th millennium BC. Glimpses of rural tourism in Iran Having numerous pristine rural landscapes, picturesque villages, and natural gifts, Iran has many to offer to nature lovers. In addition, rural tourism development has the potential to support local communities and economies and create new opportunities for employment and income generation. Despite the enormous potential for rural tourism in Iran, significant challenges need to be addressed to fully exploit this potential. One of the biggest challenges is infrastructure - many rural areas lack the basic amenities and facilities that tourists expect, such as adequate transport, accommodation, and tourism facilities. This can make it difficult for visitors to access and explore Iran's rural areas and limit the potential impact of tourism on these communities. To realize the full potential of rural tourism in Iran, it is necessary to address the challenges and seize the opportunities. This requires investment in infrastructure, promotional and marketing initiatives, and the development of partnerships and collaborations among local communities, tour operators, and government agencies. With the right support and investment, rural tourism in Iran has the potential to be a major engine of economic, social, and cultural development while providing unforgettable experiences for visitors from around the world.
