TEHRAN - The Al-Nusra Front (recently renamed to Fatah al-Sham Front) terrorists have attacked a UN humanitarian aid convoy heading towards the Western outskirts of Homs city, media reports said. "On February 20, there was an attempted passage of a humanitarian convoy of the United Nations and humanitarian agencies from Homs to the settlement of al-Waer, where militant groups, including opposition and Al-Nusra Front, are located. The Russian servicemen of the Syrian reconciliation center were accompanying the convoy," a diplomatic source told the Arabic desk of Sputnik news agency on Tuesday. The agency added that the aid deliveries were derailed by the attack of militants against the convoy. "As a result of the attack by the militants, civilians and servicemen of the Syrian government army were killed and wounded. The militants used mortars and carried out sniper and machine-gun fire. The Russian representatives were not wounded. The campaign to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of the al-Wa'er region was derailed," Sputnik said. This is the third incident in a row where a convoy from Homs to al-Wa'er is attacked by militants, the agency quoted the source as saying. On Saturday, Syrian Army troops and aircraft hit hard terrorist groups' positions and gathering centers in the Western outskirts of Homs city, inflicting major losses on the militants. The army soldiers targeted terrorists' snipers in al-Wa'er, preventing them from targeting army men. In the meantime, warplanes carried out five air raids over terrorists' concentration centers in al-Wa'er, killing and wounding several militants and destroying their equipment.
