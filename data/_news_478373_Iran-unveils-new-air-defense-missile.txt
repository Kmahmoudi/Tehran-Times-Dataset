TEHRAN – A new air defense missile powered by solid propellants was unveiled by Iran’s Defense Ministry on Sunday. The missile, called “Sayyad 4B”, is paired with Bavar-373 air defense system. It has a range of 300 kilometers. In a recent test, the Bavar-373 air defense system successfully hit a target at a distance of over 300 km with the new missile. The Iranian air defense system managed to detect the target at a range of more than 450 kilometers with its optimized radar and tracked the target at a distance of around 405 km before detonating it with Sayyad 4B, Tasnim reported. The missile’s engine runs on hybrid solid fuel and has undergone an operational test for the first time. The new breakthrough has increased the range of the detection radar of Bavar 373 from 350 to 450 km, while its tracking radar’s range has risen from 260 to 400 kilometers. The employment of the new missile also means that the range of the Iranian air defense system missiles has been extended to 300 km and the altitude of engagement has increased from 27 to 32 km.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
