TEHRAN – The inscription of Varamin carpet on the World Intellectual Property Organization was celebrated on Tuesday by unveiling its WIPO certificate at Tehran’s Niavaran Cultural-Historical Complex. The WIPO ratified to include the notion of Varamin handwoven carpets on its prestigious list in December 2015, upon the efforts made by the Varamin Carpet Weavers’ Cooperative and the Varamin Handmade Carpet Weavers’ Guild Union. Such carpets and rugs are referred to those being made in the city of Varamin, located southeast Tehran, or its neighboring areas. Mina Khani is the most common design among Varamin rugs. They bear geometric patterns with repeated medallions, especially on runners with preserving authentic tastes of the ancient craft in terms of traditional style and motif.
