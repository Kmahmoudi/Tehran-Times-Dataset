TEHRAN – Charles Taliaferro, a professor of philosophy at St. Olaf College predicts that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will win the November 8 presidential election with a narrow margin. “I predict a narrow victory for Hillary Clinton,” Taliaferro tells the Tehran Times.  Following is the text of the interview:  Q: What is your prediction of the U.S. presidential election?  A: Yes, he was recorded making debased, deplorable comments about women, regarding them merely as sex objects.  He has shown contempt for Muslims, women, Hispanics.  Sadly, this has not prevented him from mounting a serious campaign for the presidency.  I predict a narrow victory for Hillary Clinton  Q: Basically, what groups or classes of society will mostly vote for Donald Trump?  A: The group most on his side are angry, older white males, especially those in the middle class who have not benefited from the economic recovery since the recession when the economy collapsed and witnessed the loss of millions of jobs.  His other constituencies are those who oppose President Obama and his health care policies.  The next president will probably appoint at least two, maybe three Supreme Court Justices.  Conservatives fear a Clinton presidency will create a liberal bench.  Q: Trump blames the media for a coordinated action against himself. What is your judgment?  A: Trump is utterly not being attacked in the media, which has instead given him massive, positive attention.  The media has reported, for example, many accusers who challenge his integrity, as in reporting the 11 women who have stepped forward recording Trump's sexually harassing or assaulting him.  He blames these accusers as lying, publicity seekers who are pawns in the Clinton campaign.  Whatever the truth of the matter, the fact that the media reported the testimony of these women is fair and what one would expect in a free democratic republic.  So, the media has sought to uncover cases of duplicity in Trump's life, but it has been relentless in doing the same with Clinton.  So, I see no media imbalance.  Q: Is Trump or Hillary is more aggressive toward Iran?  A: That is a very difficult question!  Trump is so massively anti-Muslim that I cannot imagine he will open and receptive to a more respectful USA policy in the region.  Hillary's inclusive, pro-Muslim philosophy is more promising.
