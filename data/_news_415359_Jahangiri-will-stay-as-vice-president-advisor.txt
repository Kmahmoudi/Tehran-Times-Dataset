Issa Kalantari, advisor to First Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri, has said Jahangiri will likely keep his position in the next government. Kalantari made the comments in a message published on Tehran’s chamber of commerce website on Monday. In a related statement, pro-reform activist Mohammad Atrianfar said President Rouhani is not the only person who decides about the future ministers.  He also underlined that more than concentrating on who is appointed to what position, care should be taken that the moderation goes on its path to completion.
