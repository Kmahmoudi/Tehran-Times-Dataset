The Pentagon has announced that it has decided to send a second aircraft carrier battle group and a Patriot anti-missile battalion to the Persian Gulf area. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also indicated that new military moves in the Persian Gulf are meant to send signals to Tehran. In view of such threats, the Mehr News Agency spoke to some MPs and an official on Saturday to learn their views about Iran’s winning cards in the Persian Gulf, especially its control over the Strait of Hormoz, which is considered the world’s key energy route. Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Alaeddin Borujerdi said the United States is really “vulnerable” in the event of any new war in the Persian Gulf region. “The U.S. is seriously vulnerable and fragile, and if it tries to ignite a fire, it will undoubtedly burn itself.” The U.S. should know that it should not start a new war in the region “because any insecurity in the region will cause serious international problems.” Asked about the sensitive and strategic Strait Of Hormoz, which Iran can fully control in response to any unwise actions by the U.S. and Britain, he said, “I don’t think the Americans would commit such a mistake that there would be a need for such options. “Regardless of the Strait of Hormoz, the Americans are vulnerable, and surely they will not make such a mistake.” Pointing to the U.S. difficulties in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said, “The Americans are aware of the repercussions of any attack against Iran.” The top MP said regional countries should maintain security in the Persian Gulf themselves through bilateral and multilateral agreements. In order to justify their presence in the Persian Gulf, they are trying to make regional countries suspicious of each other and Britain is playing a “central role” in this regard, he observed. Contrary to certain views being presented, the presence of U.S. troops has only led to heightened regional tension, he stated. Iran sits on world energy route Gholam-Hossein Nozari, the managing director of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), said that OPEC produces 30 million barrels of crude oil, 24 million of which pass through the Strait of Hormoz. Iran enjoys a very important strategic position as far as geographical and energy issues are concerned, he added. Majlis Energy Committee Chairman Kamal Daneshyar said that the world’s key energy route, the Strait of Hormoz, is “within Iran’s full control.” “If the fire of insecurity is ignited in the region it will not be extinguished easily,” he added. He went onto say that the world is aware of Iran’s strategic superiority in the Persian Gulf. “If the Americans do something against Iran’s interests, we will forcefully defend our interests in the region and will jeopardize U.S. security in the Persian Gulf.” He added, “Oil consumers will suffer the greatest damage if the Persian Gulf becomes insecure, and this would bring about many problems.” The U.S. should not make any provocative moves in the region, Daneshyar cautioned. MP Elham Aminzadeh, who sits on the Majlis Security Subcommittee, said Iran has the greatest role in securing the waterway. It is no secret that Iran is the “most powerful country” in the Persian Gulf, and this means that Tehran has many tools at hand, she added. She said Iran has proven that it has the “greatest concern” about Persian Gulf security. She insisted that Iran seeks cooperation with regional countries in maintaining security in the Persian Gulf, saying Iran sees its national interests through the interests of regional countries. MP Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh said a threat against Iran would put the transit of 46 percent of the oil destined for international markets into jeopardy. “This region is the most strategic energy route in the world,” the member of the Majlis Security Subcommittee noted.
