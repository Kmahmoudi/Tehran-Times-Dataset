TEHRAN – As time passes, there is less and less access to people who lived with Imam Khomeini and experienced his frame of mind, Hassan Khomeini said on Wednesday in an indirect reference to the death of Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

 “The first generation of the revolution who could interpret Imam are leaving us one by one, but today we need people who know Imam,” he stressed, Jamaran reported. Presenting a false view of Imam Khomeini is a distortion of reality, he said, adding the guardianship of the jurist and the people’s rights should be stressed equally. SP/PA
