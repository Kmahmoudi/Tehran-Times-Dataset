“Once Iran’s main policy was to prevent its nuclear dossier from being referred to the UN Security Council, but during the past year this policy was seriously revised to the effect that developing the nuclear fuel cycle has currently become a key strategy for Tehran,” Shariatmadari told the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA). Britain, France, and Germany have drawn up a draft UN resolution that demands certain sanctions on Iran for its uranium enrichment program, but Russia, backed by China, has chopped off close to half of the original European text. Shariatmadari said that the sanctions mentioned in the draft resolution are unlikely to create a crisis for Iran, but they could be a prelude to more difficult scenarios which would have to be carefully monitored. The original European draft demanded countries prevent the sale and supply of equipment, technology, and financing contributing to all of Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. “We believe that some (countries) will cooperate with Iran, even in critical situations. The economic sanctions pushed by the United States cannot become multilateral and inclusive sanctions in the end,” the former commerce minister said. “The U.S. will not be able to create a consensus against Iran,” he added. The current situation in Afghanistan and Iraq shows that the U.S. policies in these countries are wrong and it is expected that U.S. officials will adopt wiser policies, especially after the victory of the Democrats in the Congressional elections, he observed. “We believe that Washington will move toward more cooperation with Iraq’s neighbors, particularly Iran. Therefore, this move will strengthen Tehran’s diplomatic hand in the region more than ever,” he opined. “However, we should explore new ways to improve our foreign relations in all dimensions, such as promoting the Persian language in the region, signing security-military treaties with regional countries, and attracting foreign investment,” Shariatmadari stated. The Iranian government has not followed a systematic and proper approach for expanding its foreign relations, he said, adding that efforts should be made to boost economic ties with Russia and China. Moreover, the Islamic Republic has not been successful in regard to multilateral treaties due to its political issues in the international arena, he said. He warned that the multilateral treaties signed in Iran’s neighborhood could lead to Iran’s isolation, saying, “It is essential for Iran to redouble its efforts to expand its regional relations. “The first step to this end could be resolving bilateral disputes, especially with neighboring states.”
