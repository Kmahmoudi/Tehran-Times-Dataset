TEHRAN - Hundreds of university students gathered in front of the British embassy in Tehran on Thursday morning to protest the European country's involvement in the recent riots across Iran through incitements. A sizable crowd of regular citizens and marketers gathered in front of the embassy to express their strong opposition to the role and interference of the British government and its affiliated media in Iran's recent riots. The protesters were from various universities in Tehran. Students criticized the British government for supporting media outlets like Iran International and BBC Persian, both of which are domiciled in London and advocate riots and rabble-rousing in Iran. The demonstrators chanted "Death to Britain," "Death to the U.S.," and "Death to traitors" while holding placards denouncing the hostile actions of haughty nations against Tehran, particularly Britain. The students also vowed devotion to preserving Iran's territorial integrity, asserting that the recent riots and Wednesday's brutal terrorist attack on the Shah Cheragh holy site in Shiraz were committed with separatist intentions. “Even though Britain can no longer actively intervene in or invade the Islamic Iran, it nevertheless shows its hostility against the Iranian people in various ways. Today, it is no longer a secret to anyone that the Persian-language media in London has evolved into a group of people who want to see our beloved nation fall apart and be humiliated,” the university said in a statement. “Undoubtedly, the recent disturbances in Iran and the instigators of this fresh sedition are from your country, and the great Islamic nation of Iran will not turn a blind eye to the matter,” the statement added. A number of Iranians have protested Mahsa Amini's death, a young woman who sadly died in a Tehran hospital around mid-September three days after fainting in police custody. Although she was mourned in Iran, some hardline groups scuttled the demonstrations and incited violence against security forces. Media organizations supported by the West have also promoted violence. According to an official investigation that was released earlier this month, Amini's death was brought on by a disease as opposed to suspected strikes to the skull or other important body parts. A foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorist opened indiscriminate fire on pilgrims inside the revered shrine in Shiraz on Wednesday before being shot and detained by security personnel. This was just one more act of terror aimed at escalating the conflict in Iran. The incident, which was subsequently claimed by the terrorist group Daesh, resulted in the deaths of 15 pilgrims and at least 30 more injuries. Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs, summoned German Ambassador to Tehran Hans-Udo Muzel on Thursday in response to "meddlesome" comments made by a number of German officials on the recent unrest in Iran. Bagheri Kani also referred to the German envoy's attitude, which sparked protests and violated Iranian law, as "inappropriate and irresponsible". Bagheri Kani stated, “Violence and lawlessness are not only in conflict with the right to peaceful assembly, but also disrupt public order and the security of individual citizens.” He also emphasized that the Islamic Republic is committed to upholding human rights, including the right to peaceful protests, and views the illegal interference of some Western countries as the cause of violent riots. Bagheri Kani said that the terrorist incident in Shiraz on Wednesday was a continuation of "violent and anarchic" movements that the U.S. and other European nations had previously backed. The Iranian diplomat emphasized that any form of foreign meddling in its domestic affairs or backing for violent or terrorist activities will never be tolerated by the Islamic Republic. Last Monday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock demanded that the European Union impose asset freezes and entrance bans on anyone in charge of Iran's allegedly "brutal suppression" of protestors. Additionally, the German foreign minister stated that bilateral relations with Iran "cannot be 'business as usual'" and charged the Islamic Republic with abusing the rights of its people.
