TEHRAN – Qolamhossein Karbaschi, the secretary general of the Construction Party, has said the reformists’ support for Hassan Rouhani in coming election is “neither out of helplessness nor to counter a certain person or party.”
 Not only reformists, but principlists and even the most radical groups who see themselves against reform would choose moderation if they cared for national interest, Karbaschi wrote in the Tuesday issue of Iran newspaper. His statement came after the Hope parliamentary group on Monday met with Rouhani. SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
