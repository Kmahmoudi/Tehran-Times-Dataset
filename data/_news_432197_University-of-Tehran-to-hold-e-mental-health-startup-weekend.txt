TEHRAN – The University of Tehran will hold the first startup weekend on electronic mental health from February 20 to 22, IRNA reported on Tuesday. Mental health literacy, self-care, social-mental disorders and digital technology to prevent them as well as electronic psychiatric consultation will be discussed during the event. The startup weekend, which will host about 100 students from different universities will attend the event, aims to collect ideas on development of mental health and decreasing mental-social disorders.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO), unipolar depression was the third leading cause of disease burden in the world in 2004.  Today, e-mental health refers to mental health services provided through the internet and related technology (including apps for smartphones).  In recent years, Asian countries have started thinking about how to incorporate electronic mental health into their national health systems to reach the vast populations in rural areas or those in large cities who do not have access to appropriate mental health care.
