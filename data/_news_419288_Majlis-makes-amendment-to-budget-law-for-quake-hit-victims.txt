TEHRAN — Majlis (Iranian parliament) has agreed to introduce an amendment to the current [Iranian calendar] year’s budget law to improve living conditions of the victims of recent quakes across the country. The general outline of the amendment is now adopted and in case it goes into effect it will significantly improve living conditions of people hit by the recent quakes over the past month, according to IRIB.  Slashing loan interest rate to zero and reconstructing the razed buildings are of the articles of the proposed budget amendment.  Consecutive earthquakes have shaken different provinces of Iran since November 12. The magnitude 7.3 temblor which struck the western province of Kermanshah was one of the most powerful and destructive quakes which has hit Iran over the past 30 years. It claimed more than 570 lives, left more than 12,000 injured and thousands displaced. Fortunately the rest of the quakes namely the magnitude 3.8 Tehran earthquake, the magnitude 6.1 Kerman quake, the magnitude 4.9 Bushehr quake, and the magnitude 4.8 Gilan quake didn’t cause any fatalities but caused some damages to the buildings in some other areas.  MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
