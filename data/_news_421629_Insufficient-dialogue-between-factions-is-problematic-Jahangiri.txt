TEHRAN – Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri has called for national dialogue to resolve the problems, saying the pressure Iranian nation is experiencing is due to the insufficient amount of dialogue in the country. “Unfortunately, conversation has been replaced with objection,” Jahangiri said on Monday, the Hamshahri newspaper reported. He said everyone who is fond of Iran should strive so that the atmosphere of dialogue will stay alive in the country. The vice president also expressed regret that the government has not had enough dialogue with political groups including reformists and principlists, emphasizing that the government’s relations with political groups should be strengthened.
