TEHRAN – A team of Iranian archaeologists has recently unearthed an ancient pottery kiln near Tepe Bahram in Moqimabad village of Rey, southern Tehran. The kiln along with some pottery pieces were retrieved when the team dug tranches for demarcation and documentation, IRNA reported on Saturday. The kiln bears unique style of architecture and is estimated to date from the early Islamic era, the report added. Tepe Bahram was initially an urban settlement during the Sassanid era (224 CE–651). It is probably named after the famed Sassanid king Bahram V, aka Bahram Gor, who ruled from c. 420 to 438.
