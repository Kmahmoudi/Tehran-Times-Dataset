According to officials, more than 227,000 people surviving the floods were provided with emergency accommodation. Army, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and Basij have collectively attempted to provide services to the flood victims. Heavy rainfall, beginning on March 19, has led to flooding in 28 out of 31 provinces. It has affected 42,269,129 inhabitants in 253 cities and causing widespread damage to municipal facilities, including health centers and hospitals. Many health facilities in affected areas are either fully or partially damaged, and the risk of water and vector-borne diseases, including malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases is increasing, also due to the interruption of the water supply. Following devastating flood hitting Iranian provinces some 1,660,100 individuals are in need of healthcare services in areas where the floods have left 76 people dead and 1,137 injured. As many as 295,787 people have been displaced. SP/PA
