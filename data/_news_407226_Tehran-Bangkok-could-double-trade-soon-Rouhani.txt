He added that both sides are taking preparatory steps to sign a preferential trade agreement. Iran and Thailand are apt to boost trade in oil, gas, petrochemicals, fishery, road construction, automobile parts manufacturing, and agriculture sectors, Rouhani noted. Thailand can serve as a bridge to connect Iran to East Asia, he said, adding, Iran can be the best gateway for Thailand to get access to Central Asia, Caucasus and Europe. Rouhani asserted that the two countries are better to resume direct flights to ease mutual ties in the field of tourism. Chan-o-cha, for his part, stressed that the Thai government is resolved to boost cooperation with Iran and noted that educational, cultural and scientific ties between the two sides should be expanded at the same pace with political and economic ties, Shana news agency reported.

Addressing the Iran-Thailand business forum in Bangkok, Shafe’i said, “Iran can export bitumen and oil derivatives as well as copper and chemical fertilizers to Thailand and import auto parts, agricultural, technological, and electronic products.”  The Iran-Thailand business forum was attended by President of The Thai Chamber of Commerce Kissana Vongsay, a representative from Iran Central Bank, and an economic representative from Iranian embassy in Thailand.
