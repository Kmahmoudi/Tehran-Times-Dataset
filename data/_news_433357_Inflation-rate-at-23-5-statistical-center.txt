TEHRAN- The Statistical Center of Iran announced that the inflation rate in the twelve-month period ended on February 19, which marks the end of the eleventh Iranian calendar month of Bahman, stood at 23.5 percent, IRIB reported on Sunday. The inflation rate in the mentioned period shows a 2.9 percent rise from the figure of the twelve-month period ended on the last day of the tenth Iranian calendar month of Dey (January 20). As reported, the average goods and services Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 157.3 in urban areas and at 162.9 in the rural regions in Bahman, indicating 2.1 percent and 2.8 percent increase, respectively, compared to the previous month. In the Iranian calendar year 1395 (ended on March 20, 2017), Iran could manage to experience a single-digit inflation rate after 26 years. The inflations rate stood at 9.8 percent in that year according to the Statistical Center of Iran and at nine percent according to the Central Bank of Iran (CBI).
