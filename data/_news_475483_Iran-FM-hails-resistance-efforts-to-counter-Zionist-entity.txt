TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has once again said the Resistance front was able to stand up to the Zionist enemy's immense military might and within two days forced the regime to agree to a cease-fire and impose its terms on it, which is a significant success. In a phone conversation with Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh on Monday, Amir Abdollahian condemned the Zionists' crime of martyring Palestinian mothers and children as evidence of the regime's desperation and helplessness. He praised Haniyeh's efforts to bring resistance organizations together, calling this unity a significant victory for the Resistance front. “It is a great achievement that once again the Resistance was able to stand against the vast military power of the Zionist enemy and force them to accept the ceasefire based on terms of the Resistance within two days,” the Iranian foreign minister underscored.  He emphasized that the struggle against the invaders has been an accomplishment that has revealed the Zionists' fragility more than before. Meanwhile, Haniyeh commended Iran's assistance for Palestine, asserting that the Zionist enemy attempted to impose its will on the Palestinian people and the Resistance in Gaza, but was met with valiant resistance by the Palestinian people. “With the help of God, we are determined to continue this jihad until the final victory,” he added. He went on to say that the Resistance front's recent win has opened a new chapter in the Palestinian struggle against the Zionist tyranny.
