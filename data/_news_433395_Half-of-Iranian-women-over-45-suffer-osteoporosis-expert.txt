TEHRAN â€“ Fifty percent of Iranian women over the age of 45, and 90 percent over the age of 75, suffer osteoporosis, IRNA quoted Mina Kermani, rheumatologist, as saying on Sunday. Osteoporosis is referred to as the silent epidemic disease of the century, she noted. Currently, 7 million Iranian people suffer osteoporosis, stated Kermani, adding that osteoporosis not only imposes high treatment costs both on the government and families of affected people, but causes a lot of deaths or disabilities. Women are more exposed to osteoporosis than men, she said elaborating that averagely, all over the world, one in every three woman suffer osteoporosis while this number stands at one in every 12 men. At the age of 30, the bones of a healthy person reaches their hardest. If the physical activity is low or the diet is not healthy and contains a small amount of calcium, gradually, bone calcium is reduced, it become fragile, and osteoporosis is caused, the physician explained. In postmenopausal women, the prevalence of osteoporosis is increased due to the stopping of female hormones secretion and the important role these hormones play in bone strength, Kermani stated. Osteoporosis is preventable and women can stop osteoporosis with proper diet and exercise, she added. Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture. The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are: wrist fractures and hip fractures.
