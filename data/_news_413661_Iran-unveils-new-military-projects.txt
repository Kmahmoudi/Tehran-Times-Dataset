TEHRAN – During an event held in Tehran on Monday, Iran unveiled three strategic military projects developed by its local experts. Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan unveiled the new projects, including the country’s first domestic geoportal, a system for calibration of satellite altimetry, and the first phase of a local network of permanent border posts, Tasnim news agency reported. Dehqan said the satellite altimetry calibration system is able to measure water depth in the oceans, seas and gulfs with high accuracy. The homegrown geoportal provides online and updated services for finding geographic information and positioning data for various purposes, he noted. According to the minister, the local positioning network can be used for a range of fields, including military navigation and positioning, border control, dynamics of the earth, crisis management, earthquake prediction, meteorology, atmospheric water vapor estimation, transportation and traffic control, and agriculture. He also said that one of the top priorities of the ministry is to boost the armed forces’ intelligence capabilities and update the country’s positioning data in the military sphere. In recent years, Iran has made great achievements in manufacturing a broad range of indigenous military equipment, attaining self-sufficiency in the arms sphere. However, the Islamic Republic maintains that its military power is to defend itself, and that Iran poses no threat to the regional countries.
