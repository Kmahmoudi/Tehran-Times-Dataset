Iran is the second largest economy in the Middle East region in terms of Gross Domestic Products (GDP) totaling $438 billion in 2016 and the largest market in terms of population (80 million people)” said Davies. Davies added that the visit also affords South African firms an opportunity to network with key decision-makers from Iran, captivating on prospects and gains presented in both sides.  EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
