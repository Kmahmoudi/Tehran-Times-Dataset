TEHRAN - Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, has said his country is prepared to exchange knowledge with Iraq, a neighboring country. Bagheri made the statement in a phone conversation on Monday with Thabet Muhammad al-Abbasi, the new defense minister of Iraq. “The Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoy high potentialities and capabilities in various fields, including the fight against terrorism and defense industry and can transfer this experience and knowledge to the Iraqi armed forces to help bolster security in Iraq,” he highlighted.  General Bagheri went on to say, “The level of the two countries’ military relations does not conform to my expectations. The two countries' people and armed forces must have excellent relations with each other and realization of this issue is among important responsibilities of me and you.”  Bagheri expressed disappointment that some provisions of a memorandum of understanding signed between the two nations in 2015 to enhance defense cooperation had not been put into practice, stating that Iranian and Iraqi commanders and officials needed to hold consultations at various levels to strengthen more effective interaction. For his part, Iraq’s defense minister stated that the government and people of his country will always be appreciative to Iran for its assistance in the war on terror and the destruction of the terrorist group Daesh. Abbasi said the Iraqi armed forces are prepared to increase their military collaboration with Iran. Also in a visit to Iraq in June, Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Reza Ashtiani said Iran's military advancements might significantly help Iraq in bolstering security. “Not only did the Islamic Republic of Iran provide Iraqi armed forces with military facilities and equipment at the time of the Daesh invasion of Iraq in 2014, but Iranian advisors were also present alongside Iraqi fighters on the battlefield,” Ashtiani underscored at a meeting with Othman al-Ghanimi, the Iraqi Interior Minister.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
