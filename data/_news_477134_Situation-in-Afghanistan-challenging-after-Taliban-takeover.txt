TEHRAN – Iran has said that the situation in Afghanistan remains challenging a year after the Taliban overthrew the U.S.-backed government in Kabul.  Zahra Ershadi, Iran’s deputy ambassador to the UN, made the remarks at a UN Security Council meeting on Afghanistan.  “Over a year after the Taliban took over, the situation in Afghanistan remains challenging,” Ershadi told the meeting. “According to the recent UN report, Afghanistan is dealing with a rising humanitarian crisis, a major economic downturn, challenges associated with the establishment of an inclusive government, and women and girls being denied their basic rights, including access to education.” She added, “The international community must continue to assist Afghanistan. Other conflicts must not divert attention away from or ignore the situation in Afghanistan. While humanitarian and development assistance is critical to keeping Afghans alive, maintaining basic services, and bolstering the economy, they are not long-term solutions and must be supplemented by sustained economic growth.” Ershadi continued, “As we have constantly stated, the frozen assets belong to the Afghan people and must be returned in full, without being politicized or conditional in any way. Sanctions imposed on specific individuals and entities in Afghanistan must also not obstruct humanitarian, economic, or development cooperation with Afghanistan. The sanctions should not have an impact on efforts to revitalize the Afghan economy, as the Secretary-General has repeatedly called for measures to give the Afghan economy breathing room.” She said, “Afghanistan is a member of the international community, and the de-facto authorities must acknowledge this fact and fulfill their international obligations, particularly the repeated calls for the formation of an inclusive and representative government that accurately reflects Afghans’ multi-ethnic society. Only a government comprised of all Afghans can guarantee and protect their rights.” Ershadi noted, “Terrorism and the emergence of terrorist groups pose another serious threat to Afghanistan, its neighbors, the region, and the international community. The reports on the resurgence of Daesh-affiliated terrorist groups are concerning, especially in light of the recent terrorist attacks claimed by ISKP on 5 September outside Russia's embassy in Kabul, which resulted in the deaths of at least six people, including two Russian Embassy employees, and injured several more. The de-facto authorities must commit to fighting terrorism and ensure to take all appropriate steps to protect diplomatic and consular premises against any intrusion or damage and prevent attacks on diplomatic premises, agents, and consular officers. Afghanistan must no longer serve as a haven for terrorist groups like Daesh and Al-Qaeda.” According to Ershadi, Iran has used its capacities and resources to help the people of Afghanistan overcome the challenges they have faced. She also said that Iran continues its efforts to assist the people of Afghanistan and work with Afghanistan’s neighbors and other partners to ensure durable peace and sustainable development in Afghanistan.
