TEHRAN - The Group of 77 (G-77) believes that the states member to the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) have the main responsibility of ensuring nuclear safety but it should not affect efforts for peaceful uses of nuclear technology, Iran's ambassador to the Vienna-based IAEA said on Monday. Reza Najafi, also the chair of G-77 at the IAEA, made the remarks in a speech on boosting international cooperation on transfer and safety of nuclear waste, IRNA reported.
The G-77 is the largest intergovernmental organization of developing countries in the United Nations. It was established on 15 June 1964 by seventy-seven developing countries to promote their collective economic interests. 
Appreciating the IAEA’s contribution to making nuclear plans operational, creating or enhancing nuclear safety infrastructures, and making safety capacities in developing countries, Najafi said, “G-77 encourages the Agency to keep helping countries to develop their technical capacities and skills in nuclear safety.”
The G-77 also appreciated IAEA's measures on nuclear radiations and protecting the environment by holding regional training workshops and also promoting protection against atomic radiations in nuclear medicine.
