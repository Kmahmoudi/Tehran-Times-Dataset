Hariri must well remember that in the wake of the Israeli withdrawal, he said resistance would continue so long as the occupied territories are not liberated, or so long as the enemy has not withdrawn from all the occupied territories. We really do not know the reason for Hariri's new stance. What is clear, however, is that the first victim of any curb on the resistance movement will be Lebanon itself. We are aware that there are pressures from various corners to stop the resistance in Lebanon. But the Lebanese government must bear in mind that the occupation has not ended. As long as there is occupation there will be resistance. No one can stop the people from resisting the occupation of their motherland. It is a natural instinct to resist the enemy; those who prevent it will assist the enemy.
