TEHRAN- Some 456 new wagons were added to Iranâ€™s railway fleet since the beginning of current Iranian calendar year (March 21, 2019), Saied Rasouli, the head of Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (known as RAI), announced. The official also announced that 270 new wagons will be added to the fleet in the near future, IRNA reported. Back in June, Rasouli had announced that 20 trillion rials (about $476.2 million) has been allocated for renovation of 1000 passenger and freight wagons and also locomotives in the current Iranian calendar year. He said this amount has been allocated by the Planning and Budget Organization.
