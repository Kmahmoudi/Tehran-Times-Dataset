TEHRAN – European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Monday underscored the EU’s determination to ensure the continued implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “We continue to work hand-in-hand together to ensure the continued implementation of the nuclear agreement with Iran that we together negotiated for long nights and days,” Mogherini said at a press conference following the EU-China Strategic Dialogue. She also said the European Union is committed to strengthening cooperation with China, pointing to the nuclear deal as one of the global issues on which “we clearly have cooperated and continue to cooperate.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
