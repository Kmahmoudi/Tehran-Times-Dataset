Foreign Minister Kuleba also thanked Iran for its principled stance on the Ukraine crisis. "We are not after a war and we want the issue to be resolved diplomatically and peacefully," the top Ukrainian diplomat said.  During his opening remarks at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday, UN Secretary General António Guterres said a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be “catastrophic”. He called for diplomatic efforts to continue. “I am deeply concerned about heightened tensions and increased speculation about a military conflict in Europe. I still think it will not happen but, if it did, it would be catastrophic,” Guterres said, according to CNN. “There is no alternative to diplomacy. All issues, including the most intractable, must be addressed through diplomatic frameworks. It is high time to seriously de-escalate,” he added. The UN secretary general also noted that “geopolitical divides continue to grow,” and called for “serious dialogues to continue.” U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, in her first bilateral meeting at the MSC meeting, said Friday that the United States remains open to a diplomatic resolution between Ukraine and Russia.
