TEHRAN – Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab and African Affairs Hossein Jaberi Ansari on Sunday reiterated Tehran’s position that the Islamic Republic supports political solution to the Syrian conflict.

Pointing to the complicated situation in Syria the deputy foreign minister said some “influential actors” seek to achieve their objectives in Syria through military confrontation, however since the conflict broke out in the country in 2011 Iran has been pushing for a “political solution” to the problem.
