Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that it is very important to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal.
 “It is very important to preserve it in its current form and of course the participation of the United States will be a very significant factor in this regard,” Reuters quoted him as telling reporters on a visit to Kazakhstan. He hoped that U.S. President Donald Trump would make a “balanced” decision on whether to remain engaged in the international deal. Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior White House official said on Thursday. During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Trump hinted that he may not recertify the agreement when it comes up for review by a mid-October deadline. If Trump declines to certify Iran’s compliance, U.S. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the agreement. Except the U.S. under Donald Trump, all other signatories to the nuclear deal – France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China and the European Union - have been insisting on the full implementation of the multilateral agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Scrapping nuclear deal will isolate U.S.: Joe Biden Joe Biden, the former U.S. vice-president, said on Thursday that scrapping Iran’s nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, will isolate the U.S. rather than Iran. “Next time, we’re not going to have the world on our side,” Guardian quoted him as saying addressing an invited audience at a thinktank.
