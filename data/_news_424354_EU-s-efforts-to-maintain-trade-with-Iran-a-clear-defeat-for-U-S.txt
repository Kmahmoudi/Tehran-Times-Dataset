TEHRAN- Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) Head Mojtaba Khosrotaj said the European Union’s endeavors to preserve and continue trade ties with Iran is an obvious sign of defeat for the U.S. that has withdrawn from Iran’s nuclear deal. The official made the remarks in a press conference on Monday, and added that since the U.S. has exited from the Iran’s deal, the European countries have several times announced that they are complying with their commitments related to the deal. The European countries are trying to resolve this challenge and are seeking the ways to convince their companies that the possible losses that they may sustain in their trade with Iran will be compensated, Khosrotaj noted.
