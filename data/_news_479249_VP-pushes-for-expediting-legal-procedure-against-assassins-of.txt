TEHRAN - Iranian Vice-President Mohammed Mokhber has said it is necessary that the Iraqi government hasten the legal procedure to punish those culprits involved in the assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani. He made comments in a meeting on Tuesday night with new Iraqi Premier Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. General Soleimani and Iraq’s Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were assassinated near Iraq’s international airport in January 2020 by the U.S. Mokhber also stated that the banking barriers preventing commerce between Iran and Iraq, particularly in the energy sector, must be removed. He also expressed pleasure over the formation of new Iraqi government, saying, “Contributing to the strengthening of the Iraqi government and advancement of Iraq is one of Iran's strategic objectives, which has also been stressed by the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The official also praised the close and solid relationship between Tehran and Baghdad. “To further deepen and secure the sustainability of our bilateral ties, we need to strengthen our bilateral commerce and increase our bilateral collaboration in numerous sectors more than ever before.” The vice-president also said that “the security of Iran and Iraq is inextricable from each other.” Tehran has been asking the central Iraqi government and the autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan to disarm and expel separatist Iranian militants who use northern Iraq to commit terrorist acts in west and northwest Iran. “Constant border monitoring is essential and significant, and that Iran expects the Iraqi government to prevent security risks from endangering its own security.” “If the ground is paved for the activities of the Iranian merchants and knowledge-based companies in Iraq, they can be of effective assistance in meeting the needs of the Iraqi nation,” he continued. The vice president added, “Iran has achieved broad progress and has capabilities in various fields, including knowledge-based activities.” Mokhber also thanked the Iraqi government and people for hosting the Iranian pilgrims of Imam Hussein during the Arabain mourning rites. Given his tour to Tehran, Prime Minister al-Sudani said his trip is intended to “solidify the two nations' crucial and strategic ties.” The prime minister also expressed hope that the talks and meetings between Iraqi and Iranian officials during his trip would result in implementation of the agreements. The development of joint border industrial townships and the use of Iran's industrial expertise were suggested by Iraqi prime minister as avenues to improve collaboration in energy, industrial, and agricultural sectors. He also said more high-level talks and field coordination are needed to tackle the security issues. He also agreed with Vice-President Mokhber that the security of the two countries is inseparable. Al-Sudani said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran's security is the Iraqi government's first priority, and we must avert any threats against Iran from outside parties.” He also said “the martyrdom of General Soleimani and Abu Mahdi, which were an act of aggression against both countries, would never be forgotten by the people of Iraq.” Iraq is seriously following the legal process surrounding the assassinations of the two anti-terror commanders, he maintained.
