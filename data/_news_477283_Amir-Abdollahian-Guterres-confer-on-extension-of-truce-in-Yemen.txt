TEHRAN - During a phone conversation on Sunday night, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian insisted on the need to extend the truce in Yemen. Amir Abdollahian thanked the UN secretary general for helping to bring about peace and stability to the region during their conversation, underlining how crucial it was to lift the siege on the war-torn country of Yemen and maintain the truce. On March 26, 2015, Saudi Arabia formed a coalition with a few other Arab nations, secured assistance from the Zionist regime and the U.S., and launched a large-scale attack against Yemen, the poorest Arab country. After more than seven years of aggressive war against Yemen that has resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and the destruction of nearly all of its infrastructure, they have not succeeded in achieving any of their goals. Instead, the Yemeni armed forces have been encouraged to accept a ceasefire. The six-month-old truce has been broken hundreds of times by those intruders, who have individually violated a number of its provisions. Yemen’s warring sides have failed to reach an agreement to extend a nationwide ceasefire, the United Nations has said, Al Jazeera reported on Monday. In a statement, the UN’s envoy to Yemen called on all sides to refrain from acts of provocation as the talks continue, after an October 2 deadline for extending the agreement expired. Hans Grundberg said he “regrets that an agreement has not been reached today”. He called on leaders to continue to try and reach an agreement. “I urge them to fulfill their obligation to the Yemeni people to pursue every avenue for peace,” he said.
