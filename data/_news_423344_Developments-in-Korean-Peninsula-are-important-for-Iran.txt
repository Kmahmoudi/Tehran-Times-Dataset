TEHRAN - The two Korean leaders met each other last week. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, expressed his hope at the start of the summit that the outcome of the talks would be constructive. A reporter at Tehran Times newspaper recently interviewed Ambassador (ret.) Richard D. Kauzlarich. Co-Director, Center for Energy Science and Policy (CESP), Interim Director, Peace Operations Policy Program, and Distinguished Visiting Professor Schar School of Policy and Government George Mason University, to further discuss the issue. Following is the complete text of the interview with Professor Richard Kauzlarich. Q: North and South Korean leaders hold historic summit. Why two parts reach to this point? A: This is not the first time that leaders of North and South Korea have met. See https://twitter.com/KimJYeop/status/989665527575363584.  What makes this meeting different is that takes place in a particularly confusing time.  We have swung from rumors of military conflict to rumors of a meeting between the U.S. and North Korean leaders. Q: The leaders of North and South Korea also pledged to "cease all hostile acts" amid a "new era of peace" after a historic summit. Kim Jong Un agrees to denuclearization of Korean Peninsula. Can they materialize this goals? A: You ask an excellent question. It is not enough to sign pieces of paper and have a nice photo. Will these positive words be translated into action leading to peace and denuclearization? I don’t know. Q: Trump gave the deal a cautious welcome, tweeting that "time will tell" if it leads to an end to nuclear missile tests. "The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place," he added. What will the impact of this historic summit on the decision of Trump on JCPOA? A: President Trump is right to be cautious. The U.S. has stressed the importance of North Korean denuclearization. Normal relations between the U.S., and North Korea will not be possible without it.  That should be an important point for Iran to consider. Q: What will the impact of this summit on the security order eastern Asia’s (Impact on China and N. Korea relations)? A: If this does result in normalized relations between North and South Korea, and between the U.S. and North Korea, then every country in East Asia (including China and Russia) should welcome this. I worry that China and Russia will see these developments as reducing their leverage in the Korean peninsula and therefore take steps to undermine this process.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
