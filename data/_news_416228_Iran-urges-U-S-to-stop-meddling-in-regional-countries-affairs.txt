TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Thursday that the U.S. must stop meddling in domestic affairs of the countries in the Middle East region.
 “What the U.S. blames other countries for is the result of its wrong policies in the region, especially in Afghanistan, which have just led to increase in tension and spread of terrorism and extremism,” he said. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was committed to a prolonged U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. He also warned Pakistan against providing terrorists with “safe havens.” NA
