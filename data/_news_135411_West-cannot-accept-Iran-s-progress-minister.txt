"All nuclear activities of Iran are peaceful. Despite all their exceptional efforts, the U.S. and Western states have not found any evidence to prove Iran's nuclear program is non-peaceful," he said. He pointed out that despite Iran's warnings to the international community, the U.S. and its Western allies have been illegally expanding their nuclear capabilities and are now raising concerns for the world. Abbasi said that Iran's peaceful nuclear activities and scientific progress gives hope to oppressed peoples of the Islamic world. "The Iranian nation will continue its resistance and scientific progress. U.S.’s threats, doubtless, will not diminish the Iranian people's firm determination," the minister said.
