TEHRAN – The European Union has extended for a year its sanctions against Iran in connection with alleged human rights violations in the country, the EU Council announced on Monday. “The Council today extended until 13 April 2020 its restrictive measures responding to serious human rights violations in Iran. These measures consist of a travel ban and an asset freeze against 82 people and one entity, and a ban on exports to Iran of equipment which might be used for internal repression and of equipment for monitoring telecommunications,” the council said in a statement. These measures were first put in place in 2011 and have been extended ever since on an annual basis, the statement added.
