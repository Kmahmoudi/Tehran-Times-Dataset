TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday described the CIA director’s allegations against the Islamic Republic in relations to the Ukraine war as baseless and part of the “propaganda war” against Tehran. “American officials, in continuation of political and baseless claims coupled with illegal measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran, are questioning the conventional defense and military cooperation between Iran and Russia,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said. CIA director William Burns told PBS’s Judy Woodruff on Friday that he is “quite worried” about the relationship between Tehran and Moscow.  “And what's beginning to emerge is at least the beginnings of a full-fledged defense partnership between Russia and Iran,” Burns said.  The CIA director alleged that Iranian-made drones are being used in Ukraine. “And I think it can have an even more dangerous impact on the Middle East as well if it continues. So, it's something that we take very, very seriously,” he added.  Kanaani said the United states’ “propagandistic campaigns,” which are based on lies and deception, are taking places in tandem with Washington’s different goals, including “political pressure” on Iran, promoting “Iranophobia” project and covering up its “warmongering” policies. “As we have announced repeatedly the collaboration between Iran and Russia in different areas, including defense cooperation, fall within common interests and in conformity with international law and undertakings… and is not against any third country,” he insisted. Kanaani went on to say that Iran has followed an independent foreign policy based on its “national interests” and does not seek “anybody’s permission” in this endeavor. In following such a policy Iran is committed to observing “international rules and regulations,” he maintained.    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
