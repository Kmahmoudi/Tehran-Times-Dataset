Some 1.58 million tons of goods have been transited via Iranian railways in the past calendar year, registering a record in this field, ISNA reported on Monday. The data released by Iran’s Road Maintenance and Transportation Organization (RMTO) and also Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA) prove that the transit of goods via Iran has been experiencing an increasing trend in the past Iranian calendar year.
