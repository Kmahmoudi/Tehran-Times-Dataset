TEHRAN- Behrooz Nemati, the spokesman for the presiding board of the parliament, informed that preparing the budget bill for the next Iranian calendar year (starts on March 21, 2019), the government has supposedly estimated sales of 1.5 million barrels per day of oil at the price of $54 per barrel, IRIB reported. “Each dollar is predicted to worth 57,000 rials in the budget bill,” he added in a telephone interview with IRIB on Sunday night. As IRNA quoted the Head of Budget and Planning Organization Mohammad Baqer Nobakht as saying on Monday, the government has accomplished preparation of the next year’s budget bill and is to present it to the parliament this Thursday. According to Nobakht, reducing the posed pressure by U.S. sanctions on Iranians’ lives, supplying basic goods, and paying a specific attention to domestic production and job creation are among the major options considered in the planned budget. Paying cash subsidies and supplying protective packages to qualified Iranians stand among other focal points in the next year’s budget, he added.
