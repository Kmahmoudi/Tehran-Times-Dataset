TEHRAN – Rounds of bullets were seen being shot by an anti-aircraft machine gun in central Tehran.  The bullets were targeted at what seemed to be an unmanned aerial vehicle. Trajectories were easy to notice. Reportedly, the flying object, a tiny drone, had been shot down after straying into a heavily-guarded zone in downturn Tehran, where a residence of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei is located. “Investigation is underway,” said Ali Asghar Naserbakht, a security official with Tehran Governors Office, adding, “it is not yet clear to which institute or organization the drone belongs.”   AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
