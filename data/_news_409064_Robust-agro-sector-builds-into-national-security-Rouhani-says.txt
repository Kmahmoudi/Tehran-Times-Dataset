TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani in comments on Monday paired grains of wheat with pressures from a hostile enemy, saying food security works toward national security.  “The older ones who remember the starvation during World War II can appreciate what food security means,” he said, adding, “They know what happens if the enemy puts pressure on us while we’re short on wheat.”  Tens of thousands of Iranians died of famine during World War II as Iran was occupied by Britain and the Soviet Union which believed German spies were sheltering in Iran.   The president was making the comments at the “Harvest Festival,” held in Tehran to celebrate self-sufficiency in agricultural products, particularly wheat.  Rouhani says self-sufficiency in agricultural products boosts national power and sustainability, sov Iran’s agricultural output has increased from nearly 97 million tons in 2013 to 117 million tons in 2016.  In 2016, the government purchased more than 11.5 million tons of wheat from farmers, eating into half of the country’s annual construction budget, Rouhani explained out.  “Today’s celebration is an international honor for the agriculture sector,” Rouhani stated.  In 1999, the government initiated the self-sufficiency strategy for wheat by increasing production through input subsidies and the adoption of new methods and technologies such as improved seeds, mechanization, and farmer training.  When this strategy was launched, Iran was the 16th largest wheat producing country. By 2012, according to FAO, Iran had become the 12th leading producer of wheat in the world. Iran had earlier announced to have set the goal of achieving self-sufficiency in essential crops as well as animal products by the end of the fifth five-year development plan (2011-2016).  Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation.  “Self-sufficiency in agricultural products boosts national power and sustainability, sovereignty, and our bargaining power,” Rouhani asserted.  Continued independence in the agriculture sector is threatened by low precipitation and out-of-date technology, what Rouhani was mindful of.  It is hoped that an international nuclear deal Iran and six world powers finalized in 2015 results in better agriculture performance, considering re-engagement with the global economy and access to cutting-edge technology.
