TEHRAN – The Foreign Ministry on Saturday slammed the Western criticism of Iran for execution of a number of terrorists, calling it an instance of “interference”.
 “The Islamic Republic of Iran has always adopted a firm policy on fighting terrorism and the terrorists groups which are being supported by the foreign countries,” ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. Qassemi called on Western countries to avoid adopting double standards in fighting terrorism and instead focus on eradicating terrorism. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry confirmed on Wednesday that 20 terrorists were executed after being sentenced to death. It said they had tried to carry out terrorist attacks in western Iran. The executed were members of a terrorist cell which called themselves “Tawhid and Jihad” group. “According to received information from the Judicial sources, the terrorists were accused of making efforts to form a Takfiri terrorist group, carry out armed operations inside the country, kill the innocent people and assassinate some of the religious scholars, especially the Sunni ones, and build and plant bombs in various cities,” Qassemi explained. He added Iran spares no efforts in providing security for its citizens. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein has condemned hanging of the terrorists and called it “injustice”. 
In June, Iran’s Intelligence Ministry issued a statement announcing it had foiled one of the “biggest terrorist plots of Takfiri-Wahhabi groups” in Tehran and some other cities. NA/PA
