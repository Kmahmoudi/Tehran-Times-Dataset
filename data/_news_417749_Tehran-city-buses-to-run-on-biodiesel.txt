TEHRAN – Tehran buses will use biodiesel and will be equipped with diesel particle filter (DPF) in the near future. This is a part of a broader plan aimed to meet emission standards in the metropolis of Tehran. DPF is a filter that captures and stores exhaust soot in order to reduce emissions from diesel cars. “The plan will reduce four percent of unburned hydrocarbon emissions,” Peyman Sanandaji, the director of Tehran bus transport company affiliated with the municipality, said on Thursday. About 300 diesel buses are running in Tehran and 20 buses are now running on biodiesel, he added. Biodiesel refers to a vegetable oil- or animal fat-based diesel fuel consisting of long-chain alkyl (methyl, ethyl, or propyl) esters. It has proven a reliable and effective fuel for transport fleet and buildings and has helped reduce air pollution in megacities while lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Choking air pollution hitting metropolises of Iran especially during cold seasons is making living in cities harder than ever. The predicament is blamed on numerous factors namely clunkers, sand mines, sand and dust storms originating from dried up wetlands, pollutant industries, carburetor motorcycles, etc. Nonetheless, regulations such as increasing public transportation, addressing sand storms, setting high standards for fuel quality, imposing green tax and spending them on mitigating air pollution, and being explicit about the rules are believed to help curbing the problem of air pollution.  SB/MG END All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
