He said that most of times brands are not important for costumers and many of them do not pay attention to the brands for buying or using a service. “You should pay attention to a costumer who buys from you even one time during the year. You should find your place in everyday life of people. People love football, news, animal or tasty foods. If you can find a place there, you would be successful,” he said. Pasha also discussed advertising in social media, which may not be very effective most of times due to its vast nature.
