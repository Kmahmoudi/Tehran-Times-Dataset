TEHRAN â€“ Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Iranian women and about 14 thousand cases are added to the number of patients with breast cancer in the country annually, head of the cancer prevention department of the Ministry of Health, Ali Qanbari, said here on Saturday. The survival rate of women with breast cancer, five year after the diagnosis, in developed countries is 90 percent and in Iran is 70 percent, he announced. That means out of every 10 people with breast cancer 9 people in developed countries and seven people are still alive after 5 years, the official added. Prevention and early diagnosis is very important in the treatment of breast cancer, Qanbari said, adding early diagnosis of this cancer increases the patient's longevity. Stressing on increasing general knowledge about cancers, especially breast cancer Qanbari noted that weight loss, not smoking, consuming low-fat and low-calorie foods are ways for prevention of the cancers. Women should have their own monthly check-ups at the age of 30, he concluded. NM/MQ/MG  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
