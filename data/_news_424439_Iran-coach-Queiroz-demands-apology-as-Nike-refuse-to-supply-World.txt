The Iran head coach, Carlos Queiroz, has demanded an apology from Nike after the U.S. sportswear firm said it could not supply the players with football boots for the World Cup because of sanctions. “U.S. sanctions mean that, as a U.S. company, Nike cannot supply shoes to players in the Iranian National team at this time,” Nike had said in a statement. Queiroz, whose side face Morocco in their Group B opener on Friday, said it was an unnecessary statement and asked Fifa to help. “It has been a source of inspiration for us,” Queiroz told Sky Sports. “This last comment of Nike was, in my personal view, an unnecessary statement. Everybody is aware about the sanctions. “They should come out and apologise because this arrogant conduct against 23 boys is absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary.” In May President Trump reimposed economic sanctions against Iran when the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear deal between Iran and other world powers that was signed in 2015. Some Iranians have spoken out against Nike’s decision to adhere to them and encouraged others to boycott the company’s products, using the hashtag #NoToNike on Twitter. On Monday Quieroz said that the decision could adversely affect his team’s performance in Russia. “Players get used to their sports equipment, and it’s not right to change them a week before such important matches,” he said. “We are only managers and footballers, and should not get involved in such matters. But we are asking Fifa to help us with this.” (Source: The Guardian) All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
