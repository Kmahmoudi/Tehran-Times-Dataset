TEHRAN – The views of grand ayatollahs should be considered, even if the presence of women in sports stadiums to watch a certain match is not facing any opposition, MP Ali Motahhari has said. Motahhari, a member of the Majlis Cultural Committee, also said if women are going to attend sports stadiums, religious rules should be observed, fararu.com reported on Monday. For instance, women should enter from separate entrances to sport complexes and their seat platforms should not be very near to men’s, the MP explained. Referring to women’s attendance in volleyball matches in the past, he said there is no particular problem in this regard and only religious rules should be taken into account. The Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs are preparing a bylaw for the presence of women in sport events, Motahhari said. Although the vice president for women and family affairs Shahindokht Molaverdi has made a great effort for women’s entry into sport arenas, women were not allowed to watch 2015 FIVB volleyball World League in Tehran.   NM/ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
