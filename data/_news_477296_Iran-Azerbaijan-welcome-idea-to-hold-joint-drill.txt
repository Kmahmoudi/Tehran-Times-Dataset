TEHRAN – Top military officials from Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan on Monday welcomed the idea of a joint military exercise along common borders. Willingness to hold joint drill was made during a telephone conversation between Iran’s armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Hossein Bagheri and Azeri Defense Minister Zakir Hasanov. The military officials from the two neighboring countries also agreed to implement the agreements made by the joint military commission and increase military interaction, Tasnim reported. The two sides also exchanged views about the recent fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia, as the Iranian military chief called for deescalating the tensions. Major General Bagheri and General Hasanov stressed the need for dialogue to ease tensions between Baku and Yerevan. Hasanov said the problems between his country and Yerevan could be settled through dialogue. He also emphasized that Azerbaijan has no plans to capture Armenian soil or launch military operation to get control of the Armenian territories. Iranian officials have repeatedly expressed opposition to any change in borders in the South Caucasus and said Tehran is ready to mediate to settle the dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
