TEHRAN -Hailing relations with China as the corner stone of Pakistan's foreign policies, a senior Pakistani government official said the country is committed to completing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and will support China over issues of its core interests. Pakistani Senate chairman Sadiq Sanjrani made these remarks during a function held in Islamabad on Friday, underlining the importance Pakistan attaches to relations with Beijing. “Political transition in Pakistan will not affect Pakistan's China policy and the new government will continue working closely with China to achieve our bilateral objections,” Sanjrani said at the Chinese embassy in Islamabad, as reported by Xinhua. He said the Pakistani people appreciate China's support over Pakistan's core issues of national security and vowed his country will continue to support China on issues of its core interests. He also hailed China as a model of economic growth to the low income countries in Asia, Africa and South America, adding that Pakistan appreciates and supports the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and vision of shared prosperity and win-win cooperation. Speaking on the occasion, Chinese envoy Yao Jing said Pakistan is China's good neighbor, good friend, good partner and a good brother, and the two sides enjoy time-tested friendship. He said that CPEC is the major pilot project of the Belt and Road Initiative and will be promoted by the two sides into a new stage of enrichment and extension.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
