TEHRAN — Addressing a number of armed forces personnel during the 13th Malek-e-Ashtar festival, Iran’s Chief of the Staff of the Armed Forces spoke of how threats against Iran have become more advanced. Major General Mohammad Bagheri began his remarks by referring to the recent unrest in Iran, saying, “The enemies deceived some of the country's young people by creating ambiguity and lying via cyberspace, and these deceived people may continue the path of rioting, which of course is the responsibility and mission of the country's law enforcement command with the cooperation of the IRGC and Basij in order to restore complete security and peace to the country with complete care and in compliance with all standards so that the country can walk its path of growth and excellence.” He stated that today cyberspace has become more visible than in the past, adding that sufficient information about cyberspace, media literacy, and care for the harms of this space is one of the most important points that should be paid attention to.  “Undoubtedly, raising awareness in this regard can be of significant help in keeping people safe from the dangers of this space. I emphasize all our commanders at different levels should be sensitive to this issue and act with full responsibility in this regard,” he added.  Major General Bagheri stated that it is natural that along with the advancement of methods and the sophistication of the enemies' means to undermine society, the armed forces at all levels need to deepen their spirituality, theology and political insight. Therefore, he added, it must be acknowledged that today, with the progress that the enemies have made in this direction, the traditional methods of the past and carrying out repeated and ineffective actions are not the answer to this situation, and procrastination in this field may cause the country to fall behind. According to the armed forces chief of staff, the enemy is trying to sow the seeds of division among the different branches of the armed forces. “Today, the enemies are trying to create division among the (different branches of the) armed forces and secondly among the people and the armed forces. This is despite the fact that in this regard, brotherhood and harmony among the armed forces has become more and better day by day. But one should be careful and should not neglect the enemy's attacks in this regard,” Bagheri underscored. He further noted that the armed forces are a single unit and an interconnected group and only the color of their uniforms is different. “They all take steps to ensure security, which is the most important social capital and the basis for the realization of economic growth,” the military chief remarked. According to the major general, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei as the commander-in-chief has repeatedly emphasized the need to pay attention to combined threats. “In fact, we are facing hybrid threats today. Military, security and cultural threats are emerging and sometimes unknown threats appear against us simultaneously and with a well-thought-out combination by the enemies. We must prepare ourselves for such a battle and confrontation. Also, the Commander-in-Chief said that the war game you are playing in this regard should be in the direction of countering the combined war. This extremely heavy and complicated work is on us and other commanders of the armed forces,” he acknowledged.  Emphasizing the importance of foresight and future research in regard to threats, Major General Bagheri noted that the armed forces’ researches should be in a way that would prepare them against future threats, as the costs of not having the necessary plans are heavy.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
