TEHRAN – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Tuesday that the issue of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman, was brought up by the British side during UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s visit to Tehran, to which Tehran responded that her imprisonment is not political. The Iranian authorities explained to the British side that she was found guilty in a competent court and emphasized that Iran’s Judiciary is independent and acts according to the laws of the Islamic Republic, Mehr quoted Qassemi as saying. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, has been imprisoned in Iran for 2 years on charges of trying to orchestrate a soft overthrow of the Islamic Republic.
