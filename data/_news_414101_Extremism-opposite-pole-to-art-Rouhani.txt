TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani stated that extremism is the opposite pole to art and culture. He made the remarks in his meeting with a group of Iranian artists, cineastes and writers on Wednesday night after Tehran was subjected to two violent attacks perpetrated by Daesh (ISIS) terrorists. “Terrorism is the opposite pole to art and culture, and its language is violence and bullets,” Rouhani said. “Terrorism has targeted the humanity and the civilization of a nation that has been a victim of terror since the victory of the revolution, and since then has always struggled against terrorism and even has saved other great nations from terrorism, so it’s natural that the nation should pay the price for its resistance today,” he added. He also expressed his thanks to artists for their active participation in the latest presidential election and said, “Art teaches us how to talk to God and our fellow human beings despite our differences of race, language and nationality.” He called the Islam the religion of art and added, “Science and art have no limit and we feel dynamism and vigor with art.” The meeting came to an end with speeches by a number of the artists.  Photo: President Hassan Rouhani attends a meeting with a group of Iranian artists, cineastes and writers at his office in Tehran on June 7, 2017.
