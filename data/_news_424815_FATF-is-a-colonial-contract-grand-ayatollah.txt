TEHRAN – Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi has denounced the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as a “colonial contract” with the aim of infiltrating economies of the signatories, saying it is in contradiction with Islamic laws. “It is surprising how some people have done such a dangerous job,” the ayatollah said in reference to attempts to implement the FATF, Fars reported. It came days after Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized the FATF and said the parliament should pass legislation to combat money laundering according to its own criteria.
