TEHRAN – In a letter to heads of the three branches of the government, Iranian lawmakers pushed for creating domestic messaging apps, Mehr reported. The letter, signed by 170 lawmakers, came after protests erupted in various cities and towns across the country in early January.  The lawmakers said domestic messaging apps should replace foreign ones in order to prevent the misuse of social media. They also said Daesh’s attack to Majlis, promotion of violence, selling drugs and the recent riots were examples of the enemies’ measures against the Iranian nation through foreign messaging apps.
