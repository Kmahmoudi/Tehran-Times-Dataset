TEHRAN – “Chronicles: Volume One”, the first part of Bob Dylan’s planned 3-volume memoirs, has recently been translated into Persian by Seyyed Mohammad Ali Borqai. Published in 2004, the book covers selected points from the long career of Dylan, the American songwriter, singer, artist and writer. Dylan was announced as the 2016 Nobel Prize winner in Literature last week. He is the first musician to win the award. “Chronicles: Volume One” spent 19 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list for hardcover nonfiction books. The book was one of five finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award in the Biography/Autobiography category for the 2004 publishing year. Donya-e Eqtesad Publications in Tehran is scheduled to publish the book in the near future.
