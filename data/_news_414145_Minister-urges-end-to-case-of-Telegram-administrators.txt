TEHRAN - Justice Minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi said on Saturday that the case of Telegram administrators should be dealt with and ended as soon as possible.
 A number of administrators of Telegram channels who were arrested on the eve of Nowruz face security charges. Qolamhossein Mohseni Ejei, the Judiciary deputy chief and spokesman, said in April that “some of them arrested [are charged] with anti-security issues and some other with moral charges.” “The charges were filed according to official reports and the prosecutor acted according to the law to have them arrested,” he added.
