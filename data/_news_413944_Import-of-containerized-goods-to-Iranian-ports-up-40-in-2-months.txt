TEHRAN – Imports of containerized goods to Iranian ports increased by 40 percent in the first two months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21- May 21, 2017) compared to the same period last year, IRNA quoted an official as saying. According to Mohammad Saiednejad, the managing director of Ports and Maritime Organization of Iran, the rise in this figure is an indication that the country’s terminals are going back to their pre-sanctions era.
