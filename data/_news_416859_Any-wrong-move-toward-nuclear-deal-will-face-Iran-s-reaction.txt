TEHRAN – “Any wrong move by the hegemonic system on the JCPOA will draw a reaction from the Islamic Republic,” Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned at a graduation ceremony of police cadets in Tehran on Sunday. Criticizing the White House for its “brazen and shameless” measures with regard to the JCPOA, Ayatollah Khamenei said, “Every day they show one wickedness and one mischief with regard to this issue, which proves that what our honorable Imam [Khomeini] said about America being the Great Satan is true and the regime of the United States of America is really the most evil of devils.”“The enemy should know no matter how arrogance and bullying succeed around the world, they will fail in the face of the Islamic Republic.” Ayatollah Khamenei stated that Iran started its nuclear program, because according to experts’ estimates, the country needed to generate at least 20,000 megawatts of nuclear elasticity, but the United States opposes Iran's nuclear program as it is basically opposed to scientific progress of the Iranian nation and other nations. The country’s officials reached the conclusion that Iran should negotiate and forego some of their rights so that sanctions [imposed on Iran on account of its nuclear program] would be removed. But today, we see that despite all agreements and promises and many discussions during [nuclear] negotiations, America treats these negotiations and their outcome in a totally oppressive and bullying manner,” the Leader noted. The Leader added that in the face of the United States’ measures to scuttle the nuclear deal, Iranian “officials must prove to the corrupt leaders of the regime of the United States of America that they rely on their own people and the Iranian nation, which is a powerful nation thanks to Islam, will never submit and bow to them. Ayatollah Khamenei also said, “The enemy should know no matter how arrogance and bullying succeed around the world, they will fail in the face of the Islamic Republic.” In the final part of his speech, Ayatollah Khamenei pointed to the recent sad road accidents which took about 20 lives in Iran, saying various organizations, from police to Ministry of Transportation to industrial units should clarify their share in preventing such deadly incidents and settle for removing the shortcomings.
