TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Monday that his one-day visit to India was “fruitful”.
 Zarif also said the two sides held “productive meetings on energy, banking, transportation and commerce.”  “Fruitful visit to India, building on achievements of President Rouhani’s state visit in Feb. Productive meetings on energy, banking, transportation and commerce. Excellent substantive concluding meeting with my counterpart and delegations. Resolved to expand ties in all fields,” Zarif tweeted. Zarif was in India on Monday. He met with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj. Speaking to reporters, Zarif described the meeting as “positive”. Zarif says Iran and India held “productive meetings on energy, banking, transportation and commerce.” The two countries have the political will to expand cooperation, he noted. The visit took place 20 days after Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the international nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, and is going to reintroduce sanctions against Iran. However, Swaraj said that India only abides by sanctions imposed by the United Nations and not those imposed by any other country, such as ones announced by the United States against Iran. “India follows only UN sanctions, and not unilateral sanctions by any country,” Reuters quoted her as saying. Upon arrival at New Delhi airport, Zarif said that talks with officials of various countries on the fate of the 2015 nuclear deal will be continued. Zarif met with Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, and the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK in Brussels on May 15.
