TEHRAN – The South Korean ambassador to Tehran said on Monday that despite the U.S. reimposing sanctions on Iran, South Korean Companies are willing to stay in Iran and continue their activities, Tasnim news agency reported. Speaking at the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Conference in Tehran, Yu Chang Hwang said, “[South] Korean companies are very eager to maintain their presence in Iran despite new [U.S.] sanctions, and the two countries will continue to pursue their cultural and diplomatic relations and goals with each other.” Earlier in September the envoy had said that South Korean companies have not stopped their trade ties with Iran and are willing to work with Iran despite the U.S. reimposition of sanctions. "The fact is that South Korean companies are interested in working in Iran and want to continue their trade and business cooperation with Iran. Of course, the problem of unilateral sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Iran should be taken into consideration," the ambassador said. South Korea is among the countries which have asked the United States for “maximum flexibility” on its request for a waiver to prevent their companies from being affected by renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran.
