TEHRAN — Some 3,000 international students are studying at Iranian medical sciences universities run by the Ministry of Health, the deputy health minister for educational affairs has said. “It is planned to increase the capacity to admit international students to the medical sciences universities, especially in specialized courses and PhDs,” Fars quoted Mohammad Baqer Larijani as saying on Sunday. Many foreign students refer to Iranian embassies in other countries to ask for study in Iran, he said. To ease the process of admitting students, the ministry has provided facilities in this regard. Noting that Iran has made significant progresses in the medical science, the deputy minister said there are some 66 medical sciences universities and colleges in Iran. Larijani added these universities have significantly enhanced their international cooperation with other countries. Earlier in May, Hassan Salar-Amoli, the deputy science minister, said that there are a total of 55,000 foreign students in Iran that 26,000 of them have enrolled in the universities affiliated to the Science Ministry, 10,000 in the Islamic Azad University, 2,000 in the universities affiliated to the Health Ministry, and 17,000 in the Almustafa International University, YJC reported. The Center for Science and Technology Studies Leiden Ranking placing twenty-three Iranian universities in the list of 1,000 major universities worldwide in 2018, has set the scene for attending more international students, Salar-Amoli added.
