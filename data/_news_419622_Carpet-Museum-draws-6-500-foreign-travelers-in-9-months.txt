TEHRAN â€“ Some 6,500 overseas tourists toured Carpet Museum of Iran over the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year, which started on March 21. It drew over 4,000 domestic museumgoers during the cited period as well, the museum director Parisa Beyzaei told IRNA on Wednesday. The number of foreign visits to the museum was about 4,000 in the same period last year, she added. Covering an area of 3,400 square meters, the museum boasts a treasure trove of some 2,000 Persian carpets that date from the Safavid era onwards. It also puts on display a rich patchwork of rare and centuries-old rugs, kilims and tableau rugs. Back in November, the museum was inscribed on the National Heritage List. It can be found at the northwest of Laleh Park in the heart of Tehran.
