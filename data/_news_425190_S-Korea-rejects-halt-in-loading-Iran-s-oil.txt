TEHRAN - The South Korean embassy in Tehran rejected that its country has stopped loading Iranian oil and gas condensate by its tankers in July, IRNA reported on Saturday. On Friday, Reuters reported that South Korea will not lift any Iranian crude and condensate in July, halting all shipments for the first time in six years amid U.S. pressure to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November. The embassy also announced that loading Iranian oil is continuing by South Korea. South Korea as the third biggest Asian customer of Iran's oil is holding talks with the U.S. to receive waiver from limitation in buying Iranian oil. South Korea has bought nearly 296,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in the first five months of this year.
