TEHRAN- Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has lamented lack of a robust response from the international community to the Zionist regime’s acts of aggression, saying that the only effective response to Israeli atrocities is unity of the Muslim world. During a phone call on Friday with his Kazakh counterpart Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Raisi stated that “various issues of the Islamic world, especially the aggression and insult by the Zionist regime to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Gaza, and Lebanon, demand that Islamic countries deal with these aggressive actions through more consultations and cooperation.” Pointing to Iran’s proposal for an urgent OIC meeting on Palestine, Raisi said, “While we are witnessing the inaction of the international community against the crimes and aggressions of the Zionist regime, only the decisive message of unity and solidarity of Muslims can prevent the spread of these aggressions.” The raids by Israeli troops and settlers into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound on April 6 and 7 drew strong rebuke from Muslim nations, United Nations and free-minded people around the world. They committed acts of violence against fasting Palestinian worshipers, both men and women. They also detained hundreds of Palestinian men. The Bureau of the United Nation General Assembly’s Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People condemned Israeli police’s raids on Palestinian worshippers inside the mosque. “Israel’s illegal policies and practices have continued to entrench its illegal occupation of the Palestinian territory it has occupied since 1967,” the bureau said in a statement. It called for accountability of Israel’s violations in the occupied Palestinian territory and urged Israel to comply with its international legal obligations under UN resolutions. “The bureau calls for respect the freedom of all worshippers to access the religious sites in accordance with established parameters,” it said.
