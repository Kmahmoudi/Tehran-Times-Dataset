TEHRAN - The Iranian Foreign Ministry has imposed sanctions against a number of individuals and organizations in the United Kingdom and the European Union as a retaliation to their newest sanctions on Iran. In a statement released on Monday night, the ministry listed the individuals and organizations under new Iranian sanctions. The sanctions were put in place in accordance with the decisions made by the relevant Iranian authorities and in response to actions taken by some EU and UK individuals and legal entities to support terrorist organizations and to incite and encourage acts of terrorism and violence against the Iranian people, the Foreign Ministry stated. According to the statement, the people and organizations that have been sanctioned have meddled in the internal affairs of Iran and have incited violence and disturbance all throughout the nation. It also condemned the subjects of disseminating falsehoods and disinformation about Iran and helping escalate punitive sanctions against the nation, which Tehran regards as an example of “economic terrorism.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the European Union and the UK regime for supporting and facilitating the actions of these individuals and entities, calling their failure to counter their destructive measures a “breach of international commitments in the field of fighting terrorism.” The ministry maintained that the EU and UK most recent move to implement and escalate arbitrary sanctions against Iran is in direct violation of the fundamental norms of international law set forth in the UN Charter.   According to the statement, all relevant Iranian bodies will need to take into account the necessary steps to implement the sanctions, including denying the subjects Iranian visas, preventing their entry into Iranian territory, and freezing their bank accounts and other assets under the control of Iran.
