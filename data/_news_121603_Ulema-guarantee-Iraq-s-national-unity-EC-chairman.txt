Speaking in a meeting with Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) Secretary General Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim, Rafsanjani stated that Iraqi national unity is very important at this critical juncture. The United States has no other option besides allowing the Iraqis to take charge of their own affairs, he added. He went on to say that the presence of foreign forces in Iraq is the main reason behind the current insecurity in the region, but the Islamic Republic of Iran supports the Iraqi nation and will spare no effort in trying to resolve their problems. Hakim said that religious differences in Iraq will not hinder the process of establishing peace and security in the country. He also condemned all terrorist attacks against innocent Iraqi civilians and stated that the new Iraqi government would strongly respond to these activities. The SCIRI leader praised Iran for its support of the Iraqi nation and said that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the closest friend of the Iraqi people and government.
