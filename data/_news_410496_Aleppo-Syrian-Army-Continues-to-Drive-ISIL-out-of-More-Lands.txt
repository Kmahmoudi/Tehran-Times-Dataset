TEHRAN - The Syrian army troops continued their advances against ISIL in Eastern Aleppo near the terrorist-held town of al-Bab, capturing more strategic lands in the region. The army men launched a fresh phase of operation near the towns of al-Bab and Deir Hafer and managed to advance against the ISIL terrorists after arrival of more reinforcements and dispatch of military hardware to the Eastern parts of Aleppo province. The army's Special Forces that has previously liberated over 20 regions in Eastern Aleppo, managed to take control of the towns of Salmiyeh and al-Maydouneh, inflicting major losses on the militants. In relevant developments in the province earlier this week the army soldiers engaged in several-hours-long clashes with the ISIL and took full control over the towns of al-Kharabshe and al-Sha'aleh. The army men also clashed fiercely with ISIL terrorists that had attacked government forces' positions in Khanasser hills in Southeastern Aleppo from Um Mayal direction, killing and wounding a number of them and repelling their attack.
