TEHRAN – The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Monday renewed its assurances that the Islamic Republic of Iran stays compliant to the 2015 nuclear deal - aka Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – that is backed the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. 

 “My report on Verification and monitoring in the Islamic Republic of Iran in light of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) covers relevant activities of the Agency in that country in the last few months,” IAEA Director General Yukia Amano told the body’s Board of Governors. “Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. It is essential that Iran continues to fully implement those commitments,” he stated. Amano added, “The Agency continues to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material declared by Iran under its Safeguards Agreement. Evaluations regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran continue.” The deal, agreed to by Iran on one side and the 5+1 (the U.S., UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany) on the other, was put into practice in early 2016 to curb Iran’s nuclear program in return for termination economic sanctions on Tehran. In May this year, however, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal to the contempt of the international community, especially the remaining five powers in the deal. He later reimposed American sanctions on Iran which included gold, auto industry and metals. He plans to introduce banking and oil sanctions in November. Despite preserving a right to quit the maimed deal, Tehran has preferred to stand by the world community and keep the deal, however, demanding help from the remaining parties, the European partners in particular, to make up for the economic damage of the U.S. pullout.
