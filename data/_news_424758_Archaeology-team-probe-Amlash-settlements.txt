TEHRAN – A team of Iranian archaeologists and researches have resumed exploration activity in the Amlash region to find further clues about its ancient culture. Located in Gilan province, northern Iran, the site is filled with ancient and prehistoric settlements and cemeteries. “Liar-Sang-Bon, an archaeological site in Amlash, is urgently being excavated for the third consecutive year,” IRNA quoted the project’s leader Vali Jahani as saying on Monday. “The site was initially identified in (the Iranian calendar year) 1391 (Mar. 2012-Mar. 2013) while its related mapping and demarcating projects were completed in 1393. Furthermore, the first season of excavation commenced in 1395,” Jahani explained. The site was partly looted by antique seekers due to a two-year gap between archaeological projects, he said. So far and over the course of previous explorations, valuable cultural information has been collected through studies conducted by archaeologists, anthropologists and ancient botanists, Jahani added. A field research in 2016 led to the discovery of funerary and stone architectural objects and that estimated to date from the Parthian and Sassanid eras. Some sources say that the site has yielded relics such as animal figurines, human statuettes and potteries, which mainly date from the late second millennium BC through the Partho-Sasanian period.
