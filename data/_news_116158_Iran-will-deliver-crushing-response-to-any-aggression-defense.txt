“The country’s security and strength is at its height, and the armed forces are in a satisfactory state,” he told the reporters. Najjar urged the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush to be “rational instead of acting crazy, and to think before acting”, so that they will not endanger their national interests. United States Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns warned Tuesday that Washington would not allow Iran to "control" the Persian Gulf and had sent two carrier battle groups to the region in recent weeks. The Iranian defense minister called the U.S. threats to start a war against Iran a “demonstration of power for a psychological strike” in the country. “Independence is the major axis of our activities.” Najjar said that Iranian experts in the Defense Ministry produce various kinds of air defense and armor-piercing missiles. The Islamic Republic of Iran has a full control over its land, sea, and air borders, and is not concerned about the provocations incited near its borders, he concluded.
