TEHRAN – The Russian Ambassador to Tehran, Levan Dzhagaryan, says Iran must acquire permissions in order to purchase fighter jets from Russia. Speaking to the Tehran Times on the sidelines of the 22nd international press exhibition in Tehran on Thursday, Dzhagaryan said Russia adheres to the restrictions set out by the UN Security Council.  Earlier this year, Iran held negotiations with Russia over the purchase of Sukhoi Su-30SM multi-role fighter jets as the two sides expand defense ties. In April, the U.S. Department of State Undersecretary for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon said that under the Resolution 2231, such weapon deliveries require the permission of the Security Council. Answering a question regarding the fighter jets sales, Dzhagaryan said, “As you know, after the JCPOA was signed, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2231, setting out the restrictions.” “Nevertheless, we are ready to cooperate with Iran on this sensitive issue, but only under permitted areas,” he added. Iran and the 5+1 group – the U.S, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany – signed a nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in July 2015. The JCPOA went into effect in January 2016, limiting Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for removal of international sanctions imposed on the country. MH/PA
