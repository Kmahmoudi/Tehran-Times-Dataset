TEHRAN – Crude oil production from Iran’s South Azadegan oil field is set to cross 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of current Iranian calendar month (which ends on November 21), head of the field’s development project was quoted as saying by Shana on Monday. Touraj Dehqani put the field’s current output at 80,000 bpd saying, “With 13 new wells going online, the output will rise to more than 100,000 bpd.” Since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21), oil production from the country’s biggest shared oilfield has increased by over 50,000 bpd. Earlier in May Dehqani said the field’s output is planned to reach 160,000 bpd by yearend (March 20, 2018). Located in southwestern Iran, South Azadegan is estimated to hold 33 billion barrels of oil in place. It is part of the West Karoun oil block in Khuzestan which Iran shares with Iraq. South Azadegan is being developed in two phases; production is set to reach 320,000 bpd in the first phase and 600,000 barrels daily in the second and final phase.
