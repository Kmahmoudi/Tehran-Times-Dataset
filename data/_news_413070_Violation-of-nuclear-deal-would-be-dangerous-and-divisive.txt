TEHRAN – President Donald Trump continues to send dangerously mixed signals to Tehran that could jeopardize the international nuclear agreement and divide the United States from its allies, the Los Angeles Times reported. In an article published on Monday, the Times said that U.S. President Donald Trump should not violate the nuclear deal – which is also known as the JCPOA – as violating the deal is a “dangerous and divisive” strategy. “The problem is that some in the administration, and in Congress, would like Trump to go further and punish Iran in ways that would violate” the agreement, the Times said. Trump “needs to make it clear that, so long as Iran abides by the letter of the nuclear agreement, so will the United States.” This comes months after a number of experts as well as top U.S. scientists urged the new administration not to dismantle the accord. As a candidate, Trump vowed to discard or renegotiate the nuclear deal, which was signed between Iran and six world powers. However, since he took office, the other countries strongly expressed their support for the deal and warned him against any violation. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has also spoken against Trump’s rhetoric and warned of “consequences” if he violates the agreement. MH/PA
