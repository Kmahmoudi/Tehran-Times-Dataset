TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday censured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for openly boasting the regime’s “offensive missiles” after threatening Iran with annihilation with nuclear bombs. Zarif said the irony is that at the same time Netanyahu is whining about Tehran’s “deterrent and defensive missiles”. “First, Netanyahu stands next to nuclear BOMB factory and threatens Iran with annihilation. Now, he openly boasts about his ‘OFFENSIVE’ missiles that can reach anywhere,” Zarif said in a tweet. Zarif was reacting to Netanyahu’s comments, who said a day earlier that Israel was developing missiles capable of hitting any target in the Middle East. Netanyahu also said the regime was working on weapons systems with “special capabilities that no other country has.” He added, “This is the offensive power of Israel which is very important for us in all sectors.” Foreign Minister Zarif was in fact referring to Netanyahu’s visit in August to the secretive Dimona nuclear weapons facility, from where he threatened Iran with a nuclear attack. Netanyahu’s latest comments come a few days after he said Israel was prepared to launch attacks inside Iran if what he called Israel’s survival was threatened. Zarif also pointed to the commotion created by some Western states over the test of a conventional ballistic missile by Iran, saying the hawkish Israeli prime minister “whines about Iran’s Deterrent and DEFENSIVE missiles, and the West parrots his ‘concerns’.” According to the Press TV, the UN Security Council met last week at the request of France and Britain days after Iran tested a conventional ballistic missile. At the meeting, Israel’s European allies and the U.S. voiced “concerns” about Iran’s national missile program.The U.S. even went as far as claiming that Iran’s test was in defiance of UN Resolution 2231, which endorsed a 2015 multilateral deal on Tehran’s nuclear program, without offering any evidence.
