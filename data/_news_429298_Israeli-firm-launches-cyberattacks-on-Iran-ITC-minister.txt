TEHRAN – Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi announced on Monday that Internet Gold Golden Lines, an Israeli-based company, was involved in a wave of cyberattacks earlier in the day against Iran’s network infrastructure, IRNA reported.  “The [Israeli] regime, with a notorious background in using cyber weapons in cases such as Stuxnet, was this time attempting to harm Iran’s communications infrastructure,” Azari Jahromi said in a tweet. He added, “But they had to go away empty-handed thanks to the vigilance of our technical teams. We will pursue this hostile move through international tribunals.” Israel is widely believed to be behind cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities in 2011.
