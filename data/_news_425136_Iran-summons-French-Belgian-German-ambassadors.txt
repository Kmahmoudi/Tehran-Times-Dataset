TEHRAN – Tehran has summoned the French and Belgian ambassadors as well as the German chargé daffaires to express its strong protest over the arrest of a Vienna-based Iranian diplomat in Germany. “Following the arrest of an Iranian diplomat in Germany at the request of the French police, the ambassadors of France and Belgium along with the German chargé daffaires (in the absence of the German ambassador) were summoned to the Foreign Ministry,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Wednesday. Qassemi added that Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the French and German envoys to voice the Islamic Republic's strong protest over the issue.  The arrest was made upon claims of alleged attempt by the diplomat to disrupt an MKO gathering in Paris on June 30.  MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
