The upward adjustments range from 20 to 30 cents per barrel versus September prices. Iran's Western oil sales account for 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) of its overall exports, which dropped to 2.05 million bpd in September in line with OPEC's newly-lowered output ceiling. Iran's October prices for Western outlets follow, with the differentials to IPE Brent (BWAVE) in dollars per barrel and the change in price from September.
