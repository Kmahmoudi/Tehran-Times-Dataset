Persepolis head coach Branko Ivankovic and Team Melli boss Carlos Queiroz expressed deep sorrow over the burning and collapse of the 17-story Plasco building in center of Tehran which buried more than 25 firefighters. “This couldn’t be worse, I hope we do not experience such disasters again. Firefighters are always in danger but the reason they do their job is just the love they have for people,” Branko Ivankovic, who went to one of Tehran’s fire stations to show his condolence with the firefighters, said. Team Melli head coach Carlos Queioz, whose argument with Branko Ivankovic became a hot topic in the local media, also expressed his condolence over the tragic death of the firefighters. “Dramatic pictures taken from a place very close to the tragedy show two firefighters in rescue action shortly after the building collapse. “All words are few to exalt the courage and sacrifice of these men. Also, time to support all those who are suffering and once again to present condolences to all families and friends. “May God have mercy on all those who have left. Our thoughts and prayers are with all the victims and disappeared, as well as with their families,” said Queiroz in a statement on his official Facebook page. The firemen were fighting the horrifying blaze for four hours which had engulfed the 17-story Plasco building in downtown Tehran. Suddenly, the building collapsed and buried firemen inside.     SG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
