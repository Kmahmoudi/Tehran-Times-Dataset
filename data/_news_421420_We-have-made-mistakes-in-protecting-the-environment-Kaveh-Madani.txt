TEHRAN — The nature is a proof of the fact that we have made mistakes in protecting the environment and we have to put them right, Kaveh Madani, deputy environment chief for international affairs, innovation and socio-cultural engagement said on Monday.  “We need to pay attention to research programs in order to address [environmental] issues. We have to talk based on well-documented facts and try to rightly follow them up,” Madani suggested.  He made the remarks during a conference held in the southwestern province of Khuzestan on Monday with the theme of discussing new techniques to protect the environment, Department of Environment official website reported. Madani also commented on the recurrent sand and dust storms which is haunting the region creating serious disturbance to the residents.   The whole country is feeling sorry for the people of Khuzestan and such environmental issues must be tackled, he said, stating, “We should strive to restore the environment. We should be able to be accountable to the next generation and invest for their future.” The environmental disasters remind us of the fact that the environment matters, what needs to be changed to restore the environment is the mindset, and unless we manage to modify the mindset the environment won’t be saved, he highlighted.  Elsewhere in his remarks, Madani spoke on the significance of introducing environment into school curriculum as a big step.
