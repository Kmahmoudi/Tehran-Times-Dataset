TEHRAN - Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Aerospace Force, said on Thursday that Iran should make the economic sanctions ineffective.
 “Enemies’ sanctions will never be lifted and we should make them ineffective,” he told a number of highly talented students. Noting that sanctions should be turned into opportunities, the general said economic sanctions should also become ineffective as the country succeeded to develop its missile program. He noted that the Islamic Revolution is the result of the youths’ endeavors and all are responsible to protect it. “The first generation of the revolution fulfilled their duty and brought freedom and independence for people, passing various challenges. The youths and highly talented ones in the society should continue this glorified path and all of us should make efforts to vaccinate the Islamic Iran against harms of the enemies’ plots,” he said. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4.
