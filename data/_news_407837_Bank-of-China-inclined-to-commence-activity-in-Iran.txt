TEHRAN- The CEO of Bank of China, Chen Siqing, has expressed his bank’s tendency to open branches in Iran, IRIB news reported on Sunday. In a meeting in Tehran with the governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), Valiollah Seif, the Chinese official said that Bank of China is aimed at primarily launching a representative office in Iran which would lead into opening branches in the Islamic republic. “Launching brokerage relations meeting international standards can pave the way for Bank of China to open its branches in Iran,” he said.  CBI governor, in his turn, confirmed that establishing a representative office in Iran can provide the Chinese side with transparent data about potential risks in the Iranian market and economy. Seif, in addition, highlighted the role of launching brokerage relations between the two countries and suggested that Iranian banks can open brokerage accounts in Bank of China.  HJ/MA/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
