Located in downtown Shiraz lies the elegant Nasir al-Molk Mosque, which boasts extensive colored tilework and glass on its façade as well as exquisite architecture inside. Completed in the end of the 19th century, it is one of the most photographed mosques in southern Iran. Delicate stuccowork interwoven with arabesque designs and tilework dominated by remarkably deep shade of blue form a peaceful atmosphere for the visitors, in particular when mirrored in the vast yet shallow pool in the courtyard.   Reflection of light through the stained-glass sheets, abundant carved pillars and lavishly-created polychrome faience are amongst elements that enhance the beauty of the mosque’s prayer hall. In case one is willing to get shots it is widely recommended to come as early as possible in the morning to picture the prayer hall when it is lit up through the colorful glass frames. The mosque is named after the Qajar-era merchant Mirza Hasan Ali (Nasir al-Molk) who ordered its construction in close collaboration with designer Mohammad Hasan-e Memar and architect Mohammadreza Kashisaz Shirazi. Here is a select of comments that visitors to the mosque have posted to TripAdvisor, one of the most popular travel websites in the world: “A place to see in the morning” It is very nice mosque with wonderfully colored windows. Even in the afternoon it's beautiful. But you should come in the morning when the sunlight shines through the windows. (Julia S. from Switzerland, visited October 2016) “Rainbow” A pleasant trip around this location the rainbow of lights formed with reflections of sunlight through windows and interesting museum room. (Ray C. from England, visited October 2016) “A beautiful mosque” The main thing about this mosque -- as other have said -- are the stained glass windows which cast beautiful colors on the rugs in the mosque. That is both a positive and a negative. Negative because people (largely young people) come in droves to pose for cameras and take selfies. You get shooed out of the place when prayers start so do watch the clock as you plan your visit. Definitely something to see in Shiraz. (Tracy K. from the U.S., visited October 2016) “Stunning stained glass windows” Go early to see beautiful patterns made by the stained glass windows on the carpet. The light changes with the position of the sun and creates different effects.
