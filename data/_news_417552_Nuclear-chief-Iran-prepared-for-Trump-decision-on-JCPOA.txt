TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said on Wednesday that Iran will respond appropriately to U.S. government’s move on the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA.
 Following a meeting with UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in London, Salehi said Tehran has “prepared itself for various scenarios”, Press TV reported. He added, “The European Union has so far indicted that it is willing to preserve the JCPOA but whether or not it can resist the U.S. is unpredictable.”  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
