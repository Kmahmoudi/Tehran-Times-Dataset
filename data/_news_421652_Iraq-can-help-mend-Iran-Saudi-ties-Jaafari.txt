TEHRAN – Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari has said in a press conference that Baghdad can help Iran and Saudi Arabia mend ties, Mehr reported on Wednesday.
 Iran and Saudi Arabia have been at odds since the conflict arose in Syria in 2011. The relations suffered more setbacks as 464 Iranian pilgrims were crushed to death in a stampede in Mecca in September 2015.  The relations started deteriorating as a number of Iranians attacked the Saudi diplomatic missions in Tehran and Mashhad in protest to the execution of the pro-democracy cleric Nimr al-Nimr in January 2016. Though senior Iranian officials condemned the move, Saudi completely cut ties with Tehran.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
