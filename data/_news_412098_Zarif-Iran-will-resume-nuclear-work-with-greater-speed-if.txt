ISFAHAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned late on Monday that if the United States continues reneging on its commitments under the nuclear deal to the extent that Iran sees the keeping of the deal not in conformity with its national interests the Islamic Republic will resume its nuclear activities with “even greater” speed.

 The July 2015 nuclear deal, offically called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, went into effect in January 2016.
