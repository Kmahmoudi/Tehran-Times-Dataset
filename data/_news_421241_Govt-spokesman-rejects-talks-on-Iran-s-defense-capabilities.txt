TEHRAN – Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht on Tuesday reiterated Tehran’s policy not to negotiate with foreigners about its missile power, saying no country has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of the Islamic Republic. “Our defense capabilities are nobody’s business,” Nobakht told reporters during his weekly press conference, Tasnim reported. He said Iran’s “policy is based on interaction” but it would never accept any “bullying”. Iranian officials have repeatedly said that the country’s missile power is not negotiable. MH/PA
