TEHRAN - Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said on Friday that Iranian and Pakistani officials should have more contacts to help expand relations.
 During a meeting in Islamabad with Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari, a Pakistan MP, Boroujerdi said construction of Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline should be completed. Elsewhere, he attached great importance to the Palestinian issue and called it one of the most important issues of the Islamic world. He expressed regret over the fact that some Islamic countries expand relations with the Zionist regime of Israel but cut ties with the other Muslim countries. Boroujerdi also said that Iran is ready to discuss joint cooperation with Pakistan in issues related to Chabahar and Gwadar port cities. The Pakistani MP called Chabahar and Gwadar port cities “complementary”. He also said that all the countries in the Middle East including those in the Persian Gulf region should bridge the differences in line with boosting unity in the world of Islam.
