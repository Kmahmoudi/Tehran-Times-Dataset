TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that there will be no war between Iran and the U.S. and nor will be any negotiation between the two countries.
 “We can enter the dangerous game of talks with the U.S. only when we reach the economic, political and cultural power that we have in mind and when the U.S. pressure and hype cannot affect us. Currently, negotiation will be definitely harmful to us and is banned,” he said during a meeting with thousands of people from various social classes. The Leader added as Imam Khomeini “banned talks with the U.S. and I also ban it”. The Leader also said, “There will be no war, because, as it was in the past, we will never initiate a war and nor will the U.S. start a war, because it will be totally harmful to them. The Islamic Republic of Iran and the Iranian nation have proved that they will do bigger harm to any aggressor.” “For what reason should one sit at the negotiating table with a bullying and dishonest regime?” the Leader asks. He noted that negotiation with the current U.S. administration is impossible. “Even if we were to negotiate with the U.S., we would never hold talks with the current U.S. administration.” In a press conference at the White House on July 30, Donald Trump said he would meet with Iran "anytime they want to" and without "preconditions". His call for negotiation came a week after he threatened Iran in an all-caps tweet. “For what reason should one sit at the negotiating table with a bullying and dishonest regime?” Ayatollah Khamenei asked in reference to the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and restoration of sanctions against Iran. Ayatollah Khamenei added the Iranian negotiators passed some “redlines” during the nuclear negotiations which resulted the nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. ‘Economic problems are result of domestic issues’ Ayatollah Khamenei also said the current economic problems in the country mostly originate from “domestic issues, management styles and executive policy-making”. “I am not saying that sanctions have no effect, but most of the recent economic problems are related to performances. Sanctions cannot be very effective if the performances be better and more powerful,” he stated. He also refuted claims that the Islamic Republic reached a dead end. “Anyone who announces that we have reached a dead end is either ignorant or his words are treacherous.” He noted that the Islamic Republic of Iran passed all the difficulties in the past and will also pass this difficult stage. The Leader also criticized those who say the government should resign, saying they are repeating the words of the country’s ill-wishers. “The government should stay and do its duties steadfastly to resolve problems,” the Leader stressed.
