TEHRAN – In a tweet on Monday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif compared and contrasted two simultaneous summits that were held recently, namely the G7 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

 “While the G7 were busy fighting among themselves in Quebec—and unsuccessfully trying to appease the habitual Deal-Breaker-in-Chief—the #SCO Summit in Qingdao illustrated something altogether different: respectful cooperation among nations committed to multilateralism,” Zarif wrote. In an earlier tweet the same day, he wrote “#SCO Summit in China illustrated how fast the world is changing. Commitment to mutually beneficial cooperation, solid support for JCPOA & rejection of unilateralism.” The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The SCO has China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and Pakistan as member states. Iran is an observer member.
