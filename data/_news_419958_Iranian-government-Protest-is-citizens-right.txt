TEHRAN - Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Tuesday that it is the right of citizens to hold protests and the government respects it.
 “From the government’s point of view, the people have the right to protest based on citizenship rights and their voice can reach officials within the framework of law,” Nobakht told a regular a press conference. He noted that according to the Constitution, rioters are different from marchers. “However, those who counter the riots should act within the framework of law and their authority,” the government spokesman suggested. Since Thursday, groups of protesters have held protests in several cities across the country to voice their anger over rising prices, unemployment and corruption. ISNA reported on Tuesday that the Interior Ministry invited secretary generals of main political parties to discuss the recent protests across the country and devise solutions to boost national unity. Iran’s First Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri tweeted on Tuesday, “Gradual and legal reformations are the way to improve the situation of the country and the people’s living standards which are possible through active participation of the people, highly talented people and the institutions. This is the way which create hope and get all involved in determining their destiny.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
