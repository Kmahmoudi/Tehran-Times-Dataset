TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday ordered the Foreign Ministry to make sure that the remaining signatories of the nuclear deal, officially called the JCPOA, would give concrete and practical guarantees on the full implementation of the agreement. Upon the order, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is set to travel to Beijing, Moscow and Brussels for consultations on future of the nuclear deal. On Tuesday, immediately after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA, Rouhani threatened if the other signatories to the multilateral agreement also fail to honor their commitments under the deal, Iran will quit the agreement and will resume its nuclear enrichment activities at a higher speed.   MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
