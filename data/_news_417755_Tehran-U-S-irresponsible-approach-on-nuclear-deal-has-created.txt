TEHRAN – Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Thursday that the U.S. administration’s “irresponsible approaches” on the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has created a new situation.
 “The JCPOA is not a bilateral deal between Iran and the U.S. and is an international document supported by the United Nation Security Council,” he said during a meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov in Moscow. Araqchi, the deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs who was a key negotiator with the P5+1 group in crafting the nuclear agreement, said one country should not be permitted to decide for the whole world. For his part, Ryabkov reiterated Russia’s commitment to fulfil its obligations under the JCPOA. According to a press release published by the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website, the officials had a detailed exchange of opinions on the current situation around the JCPOA considering U.S. President Trump’s recent decision to not confirm Tehran’s conscientious compliance with the JCPOA to Congress. Ryabkov and Araghchi discussed the tasks for improving coordination between Russia and Iran in the interests of preserving the JCPOA and further developing bilateral cooperation. Araqchi was in Moscow to attend the 2017 Moscow Nonproliferation Conference. NA/PA
