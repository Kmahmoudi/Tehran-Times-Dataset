There is a mutual understanding between Russia and the European Union to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Russian Permanent Representative to the EU said on Friday. 
 “Extensive contacts continue, we have a rather high level of mutual understanding,” TASS quoted Vladimir Chizhov as saying. He said that Russia and the EU continue to maintain extensive contacts concerning the implementation of the nuclear deal. “We are in close contact with the EU. Brussels is considering a special mechanism that will make it possible to continue cooperating with Iran,” he added. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. Russia, China, and the European Union trio – Germany, France and Britain – are the remaining parties of the agreement. European Union has offered an initiative named the special purpose vehicle (SPV) which is intended to protect trade with Iran against U.S. sanctions. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has said that the SPV meant to help companies do business with Iran will be completed by the end of the year. During a meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Abbas Araqchi on Friday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that Moscow makes efforts to boost cooperation with Iran and support the country against the U.S. sanctions.
