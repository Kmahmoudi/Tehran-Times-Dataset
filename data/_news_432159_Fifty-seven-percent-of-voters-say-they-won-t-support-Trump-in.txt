More than half of registered voters say they will definitely vote against President Trump in 2020 and will even support a candidate running against him, a poll released Thursday shows.  Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed said they will cast a ballot against Trump, while 30 percent said they would definitely back Trump, and 13 percent said they were unsure, according to a “PBS News Hour,” NPR and Marist poll. Broken down by political party, 69 percent of Republicans will definitely vote for Trump, compared to 10 percent who say they will vote against him. Twenty-one percent say they’re not sure. Among Democrats, 91 percent say they will vote against the president, 5 percent will vote for him and 5 percent said they haven’t decided yet. Sixty-two percent of voters registered as independents say they’ll oppose Trump, 25 percent will back him and 13 percent are undecided. Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, said the survey shows Trump has some rough sledding ahead of him if he wants to be re-elected. “The president has had his base and not much else,” Miringoff added. Among Democrats and independents leaning toward Democrats, 76 percent say they have a favorable impression of former Vice President Joe Biden, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders with 57 percent and Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 53 percent. Twenty-nine percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they view Sen. Mitt Romney favorably and 24 percent see former Ohio Gov. John Kasich favorably. The poll surveyed 1,023 adults from Jan. 10 to 13. It has a plus/minus 4.2 percentage-point margin of error.
