TEHRAN -- Iran’s nomadic Qashqai women in southern Fars Province still wear their colorful ethnic costumes. Qashqai is a part of the Turkic peoples from Central Asia who settled in Iran during the 11th and 12th centuries. Their costume, which is in bright, bold and energetic colors, is now a part of their cultural attraction. The dress of Qashqai is composed of multiple gathered skirts, tunics (keynak) with slit at the sides, covered with short jackets (arkhaloq) with pointed sleeves.  They put a small cap (kolaqcha) and wear diaphanous scarves (lachak and charqad). They also use a wrapped silk headband (yaghloq and qalaq), which they tie over the headscarf, with its ends trailing down the back.  Different tribes of Qashqai are distinguished by subtleties in dress such as the knotting of silk headbands and the choice of fabric colors. They also use handmade shoes.  Colorful glass beads, coins and attractive purling are extraordinary ornamentation used in special occasions by Qashqai women. It manifests the social position and their cultural-economic status.  They also use ornamentation, which include a charm or a written prayer to ward off evil. Iranians in different parts of the country used to wear ethnic costume in past time. In some regions, people still use traditional dresses. The clothes reveal facts about lifestyle, history and beliefs of the locals.   SB/MQ
