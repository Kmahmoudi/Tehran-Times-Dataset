TEHRAN – The number of Iranians who visited Russia in 2017 rose considerably compared to the year earlier, IRNA reported, citing an official with Russia’s Federal Agency for Tourism. Some 100,000 Iranians visited Russia in 2017, according to the official. According to Russian media, the country hosted roughly 67,000 Iranian nationals in 2016 that indicates a solid growth of 72 percent year on year. Russia anticipates tourist influx from Iran to increase during the FIFA World Cup in June and July. “In 2018, we expect a significant number of both Iranian fans and Iranian tourists,” TASS quoted Oleg Safonov, the director of Russia’s Tourism Agency, as saying in April. On March 28, Iran and Russia inked a visa-free agreement for tourist groups, as the two countries are taking steps towards broadening bilateral tourism ties. Based on the agreement tour groups of 5 to 50 people heading to Russia from Iran or vice versa are granted a visa-free stay of up to 15 days.
