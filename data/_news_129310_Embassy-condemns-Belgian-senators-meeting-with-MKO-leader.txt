"The embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Brussels deplores the initiative of a certain number of Belgian senators to invite Maryam Rajavi, leader of the terrorist MKO, to the Belgian Senate, and asserts that all interaction and cooperation with terrorist groups is unacceptable and unjustifiable in the eyes of the international community and the government and people of Iran," said the embassy in a press statement issued Friday evening. It "strongly condemned" the meeting between Rajavi and a number of Belgian senators last Tuesday and highlighted the MKO's having carried out a number of terror attacks against the people and authorities of Iran. The MKO has also cooperated closely with the former regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and, moreover, it is on the EU's list of terrorist organizations, noted the statement. Rajavi met in a side room of the Belgian Senate in Brussels with its president, Mrs. Anne-Marie Lizin, and five other senators on Tuesday. Lizin had underlined that the meeting with Rajavi was unofficial. In Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Ministry called twice the ambassadors of Belgium and Finland to strongly protest the visit of Rajavi to the Belgian Senate, saying it was an unfriendly act of Belgium. Finland currently holds the EU Presidency.
