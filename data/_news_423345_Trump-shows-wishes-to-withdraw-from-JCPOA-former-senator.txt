TEHRAN – Bennett Johnston, an American politician in the Democratic Party and lobbyist who represented Louisiana in the United States Senate is the current chairman of the American-Iranian Council.  Mr. Johnston is of the opinion that “Trying to predict what President Trump will do is a fool’s errand, but it does appear that every indication is that he wishes to withdraw from JCPOA.” “Netanyahu clearly wants to kill the deal,” Johnston tells the Tehran Times. The Chairman of the American-Iranian Council also adds that “IAEA is the proper group to assess Iran's compliance with JCPOA..” Following is the text of the interview: Q: Do the documents released by Netanyahu include any new details about Iran's nuclear deal? As you know Olli Heinonen the ex-Deputy Director General of the IAEA provided these documents to the Board of Governors in a confidential session back in 2008. So, the recent information couldn’t provide anything new. A: The Israeli information provides information about places and people involved in the program and fills in the details. It does not show a violation of the JCPOA, but it does show an intent to have a nuclear weapons program. It is a real embarrassment to Iran. Q:  According to IAEA inspection team, the so-called Amad plan was stopped abruptly by Tehran in late 2003. So, why does Netanyahu revive a scenario already rejected by IAEA? A:  Netanyahu clearly wants to kill the deal. Q:  As the White House assessed the newly released documents were authentic, shall we think of Netanyahu’s claims as a prelude to trump's withdrawal from JCPOA? A:  Trying to predict what President Trump will do is a fool’s errand, but it does appear that every indication is that he wishes to withdraw from JCPOA Q:  Netanyahu claims that Iran isn't complying with nuclear deal. Now the question is which one has the right to assess Iran’s compliance or violation, Israel or IAEA? A:  Of course the IAEA is the proper group to assess Iran's compliance with JCPOA. The Israel papers reinforce, rather than detract from the need for JCPOA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
