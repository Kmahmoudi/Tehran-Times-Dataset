TEHRAN – On Friday, President Hassan Rouhani insisted on Tehran’s long held position that Iran will not seek any country’s permission to develop its missile capability for defensive purposes.  "We will increase our military power as a deterrent. We will strengthen our missile capabilities.... We will not seek permission from anyone to defend our country," Rouhani told a military parade marking the beginning of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Iran on September 22, 1980.
