TEHRAN – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday that Europe will offer in coming days its package to save the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
 “The Europeans are supposed to offer their package to preserve the JCPOA in upcoming days about which we will hold talks with top officials of Austria as country which holds presidency of the European Union,” he told reporters before his departure to Bern, Switzerland.  Rouhani is also scheduled to visit Austria.  Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the multilateral nuclear agreement in May and plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran. He has threatened to sanction any foreign company that cooperates with Iran.   “Today, Europe opposes unilateralism with a louder voice,” Rouhani said.  He described the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA as a violation of international agreements. The nuclear deal, struck in July 2015 between Iran, the European Union, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The agreement was endorsed by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. The deal went into force in January 2016.  Rouhani also attached great importance to relations and cooperation with European countries. “Relations with European countries and negotiations with them is of importance, because the three European countries [Britain, France and Germany] and China and Russia are making efforts to preserve the JCPOA without the U.S.,” he stated. He added, “All feel that the survival of the JCPOA benefits the region and unanimously condemn the U.S. for pulling out from the 2231 resolution of the United Nations.” Iran has repeatedly warned that if its interests are not guaranteed under the nuclear agreement it would resume its nuclear activities with a greater speed. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on June 23 that the three European signatories to the JCPOA alongside with the European Union had promised to offer a package of practical steps that would fulfill Iran’s demands under the nuclear agreement. He said the package will include Iran’s oil sales, payments for its oil and transportation.
