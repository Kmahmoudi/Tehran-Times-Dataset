TEHRAN- Kazem Gharibabadi, Secretary of Iran's High Council for Human Rights, toured Evin prison in Tehran on Sunday, saying that clashes and fires broke out among those detained in Ward No. 7, which houses thugs and detainees convicted of severe crimes.  The flames, hopefully, did not spread to neighboring wards, he added. Gharibabadi inspected several areas of Evin prison and spoke with the Chief of the Prisons Organization about the most recent conditions facing the inmates. He stated on his Twitter account that “in my capacity as the Secretary General of the High Council for Human Rights, I just visited different sections of Evin Prison, including its health center. I also talked with Head of the State Prisons Organization regarding the current situation of prisoners.” "Clashes and fires broke out by those incarcerated in Ward No. 7, where thugs and prisoners convicted of violent crimes are held. Hopefully, the fires did not spread to other wards," he added. He said that "Evin Prison is now calm again, and the issue is fully under control." He emphasized that "all of the convicts are in communication with their families and that those who suffered injuries have gotten care." Gharibabadi stressed that “prisoners' safety and security are of utmost significance. Prison officials have pledged to ensure that all inmates' rights are upheld in full.” The Judiciary asserts that after a fight between a few inmates of the prison a fire broke out in a workshop that led security and medical personnel to assist in putting an end to the fight. In addition, they aided in evacuating 70 inmates trapped in the blaze to safety; nevertheless, eight inmates died and 61 others sustained injuries. The prompt arrival of Tehran’s prosecutor, director of the Prisons Organization, police forces, firemen, and emergency workers at the scene aided in rescuing almost 70 individuals. During the incident, some inmates made failed attempts to get out of the prison. In the early hours of Sunday, everything at Evin prison were back to normal, and inmates were permitted to call their family and friends on the phone.
