TEHRAN – The Iranian Ambassador to Iraq, Iraj Masjedi, held talks on Thursday with Masoud Barzani, former president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. During the meeting, Masjedi described bilateral ties as strategic, saying prospects for mutual cooperation are bright, IRNA reported. “Iraqi Kurdistan Region’s economic situation will improve in light of mutual collaboration,” he said, adding that Iran has a remarkable volume of trade with Iran and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).  Transfer of Iran’s gas to the KRG, mutual cooperation and private sector’s engagement can provide suitable opportunities for boosting relations, the Iranian envoy stated.
