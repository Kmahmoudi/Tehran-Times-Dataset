TEHRAN – Expediency Council secretary Mohsen Rezaee said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump will be defeated by the Iranian nation should he play any games against the country. “I am personally confident that Trump will be defeated by the Iranian nation because his conduct shows he does not know the Iranian nation and has miscalculated our capabilities,” Rezaee was quoted by ISNA as saying. The former IRGC chief added that the nation has successfully overcome great pressures and sanctions over the years.
