TEHRAN – Housed within an elegant Qajar-era edifice in downtown Tehran, the Glassware and Ceramic Museum of Iran also known as Abgineh Museum offers its visitors a wide range of glasswork, brickwork, plasterwork, mirrorwork as well as inlaid artworks.   The premises which have been turned into the museum roughly date back to a century ago. It was originally constructed upon the orders of the 20th-century politician Ahmad Qavam better known as Qavam-ol-Saltaneh for his personal lodging.   Situated a short walk northward of the National Museum of Iran on Si-e Tir St., the museum puts on display nationwide relics that date from the 2nd millennium BC to the modern day. The two-story octagonal structure itself retains a lot of charm as seamlessly blends genuine Iranian architecture with the 19th-century European motifs. Here is a select of comments that visitors to the museum have posted to TripAdvisor, one of the most popular travel websites in the world: “Nice little museum” You’ll love the Abgineh Museum if you're interested in glass and pottery. The building is pretty and the interior is exquisite. (Egoissimo from Romania, visited August 2016) “Museum housed in a beautiful house!” I am glad I visited this place, although I am not a big fan of ceramics and glassware, but the building itself is beautiful. It is a nice museum to visit if you have spare time … (Maksauman form Hong Kong, visited September 2016) “It’s OK” Set in what must have been a magnificent house in its day. The grounds need to be maintained. The items were nice but I think this is missable. (Craig G. from London, visited June 2016) “A Boutique Museum” Very close to the National Museum, this museum is housed in a former residence. The collections of glass and ceramics are modest, but the building itself is of architectural interest. The circular grand staircase is the central feature of the building. (KC.
