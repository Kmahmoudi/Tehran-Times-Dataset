TEHRAN -- Professor Felix Berenskoetter says that International theories “don't just explain”. Berenskoetter, who teaches at London University, believes that International theories “also try to tell us what the 'issues' in international politics are in the first place.” Berenskoetter made the remarks in an e-mail interview with the Mehr News Agency recently.
