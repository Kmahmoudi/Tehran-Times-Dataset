TEHRAN – Washington will regret its sanctions against Iran as the embargoes only strengthen the Islamic Republic, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Deputy Coordinator Ali Fadavi said on Tuesday.  “Like in the past, they will regret their actions in the future because they just push us not to rely on foreigners for resolving the problems, but to try to solve them by relying on domestic capabilities,” Brigadier General Fadavi said, ISNA reported. He also pointed to the 33-day Israeli war against Lebanon with the U.S. support in 2006, saying, “They were afraid of the formation of Hezbollah right beside the occupied Palestinian lands, but after the 33-day war, 20 Hezbollah groups were formed at their borders.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
