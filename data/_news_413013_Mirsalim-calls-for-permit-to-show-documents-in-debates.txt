TEHRAN – Presidential candidate Mostafa Mirsalim has called for permit for candidates to show documents during the live debates.

 Mirsalim made his demand in a letter he wrote to the other five candidates in view of the free flow of information. “I was in favor of live debates… and also believe we should not fear freedom tempered by law. We should not prevent free circulation of information on premises of security,” he wrote. “If the interior minister cannot trust candidates to observe national interests, how could people trust them?” SP/PA
