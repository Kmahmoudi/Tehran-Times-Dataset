TEHRAN - Richard W. Murphy, the former U.S. ambassador to Syria and Saudi Arabia, says “There has been less international media attention paid to the fighting and suffering in Yemen than has been the case in Syria and Iraq.” Murphy says “The human condition in Yemen is dire with a grave shortage of potable water and medicines to combat a major outbreak of cholera and a general shortage of food for a severely malnourished population.”
Following is the text of the interview:
Finally, the domestic Yemeni political situation is ill understood. Q: Saudi media claim purpose of Saudi attacks on Yemen is restore stability to the region. What is your opinion? A: In my opinion Saudi Arabia attacked Yemen militarily to block what it saw as a further attempt by Iran to extend its influence in the region. Q: What is the role of the United States and Israel in the Yemeni war? How do you assess the human condition in Yemen? A: The United States has been the main provider of arms to Saudi Arabia for many years. It has continued to provide arms and ammunition to the Kingdom replacing stocks used in the fighting in Yemen. Reportedly it has supplied some intelligence to improve targeting by the Saudi Air Forces in its attacks on Yemeni military targets. I have no information on an Israeli role in the war. The human condition in Yemen is dire with a grave shortage of potable water and medicines to combat a major outbreak of cholera and a general shortage of food for a severely malnourished population.   Q: What has the international community done to reduce the suffering of the Yemeni people? A: There have been substantial international efforts to supply food and medicine to Yemen. The US has led this campaign but internal distribution of international assistance has been faulty and complicated by the civil war. Q: Why is Yemen's war on the international scene less worth considering? And why is the silent war called? A: There has been less international media attention paid to the fighting and suffering in Yemen than has been the case in Syria and Iraq. Both of those countries also have been the source of refugees who in their tens of thousands of their citizens are seeking asylum in European countries. This has caused strong political currents in Europe critical of efforts of those authorities who have sought to find a way to keep their borders open.
