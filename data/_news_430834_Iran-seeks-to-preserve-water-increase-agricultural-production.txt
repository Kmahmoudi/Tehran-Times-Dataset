Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) and Agriculture Ministry have vowed to increase agricultural production by 2.2 kilograms per square meter of water used in cultivation by 2026. The two sides agreed to help reach this objective as part of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) singed by ICCIMA Head Gholam Hossein Shafeiand and Iran Agriculture Minister Mahmoud Hojjati. The 10-year agreement was signed on the sidelines of the second biennial Water Economy Conference that was held at the place of ICCIMA in Tehran on Tuesday. So far, Iran food production stands at only 1.1 kilogram per square meter of water, according to the figures published in the MoU.  Iran is situated in a dry plateau with limited water resources. Tehran has been trying in recent years to decrease water consumption in its agriculture sector by introducing new irrigation methods.   (Source: otaghiranonline.ir) CAP:  ICCIMA Head Gholam Hossein Shafei (L) shaking hand with Agriculture Minister Mahmoud Hojjati after signing an MOU on increasing agricultural production All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
