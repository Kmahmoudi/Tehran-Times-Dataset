TEHRAN – Vestiges of a Seljuk-era (1037–1194) mosque have been unearthed in Astaneh, a city in Markazi province, west central Iran. “The mosque was [fortuitously] uncovered during a water and wastewater development project,” Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini, cultural heritage chief of the province, announced on Sunday. Gradual retrieving of several artifacts including potteries, pickaxes, earthenware inscriptions, metal vessels and tools over the past month made the project sensitive to the province’s cultural heritage, tourism and handicraft department, Hosseini added.
