The UN Security Council presidency for the month of June is held by Denmark. In his letter, Zarif rejected remarks by the Zionist regime's representative in the UN, alleging Iranian support for terrorism, as "unfounded." The Zionist regime's representative in the UN, in an earlier letter to Annan, briefly discussed recent developments in the Occupied Territories and the Hezbollah in Lebanon, and named Iran and Syria as supporters of terrorism. "Such allegations by the Zionist regime against other states are but another example of the regime's deliberate moves to divert the attention of the international community from the regime's terrorist measures, war crimes and atrocities in these territories which have endangered regional peace and security. "It is clear that none of the deceptive measures taken by the Zionist regime can hide the fact that its entire history is a chronicle of terrorist, illegal and inhuman measures it has taken against international law," Zarif said. "It is ironical that the Zionist regime, which defies and obstinately refuses to observe the principles of the UN Charter and other international regulations, including UN Security Council resolutions, hypocritically calls on other states to observe these resolutions," Zarif added.
