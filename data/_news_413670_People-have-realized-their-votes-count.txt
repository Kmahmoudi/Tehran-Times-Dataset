TEHRAN – A vocal principlist lawmaker published a comment about the presidential election on his Instagram late on Sunday where he said the people have come to the point that their votes matter.

 “People have realized that their votes count,” Ali Motahari said of the high turnout. He praised people’s choice of moderation against heavy barrage of media criticism to misrepresent the incumbent government. He also called on “radical, anti-government media” to correct their ways. “Power is not everything. There also exist things called national interest and Islam.” Motahari then invited principlists to “become real principlists”.  SP/PA
