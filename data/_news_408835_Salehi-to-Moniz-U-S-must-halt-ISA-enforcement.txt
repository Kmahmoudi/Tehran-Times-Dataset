TEHRAN – Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi told U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz in a meeting in Vienna on Sunday that that the U.S. administration must prevent implementation of the Iran Sanctions Act and remain committed to its obligations under the international nuclear agreement between Iran and great powers.
 Iran’s top officials, including President Hassan Rouhani, have said if the ISA is implemented it will violate the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Rouhani has asked his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama to use his authority to veto the ISA. Salehi and Moniz, both nuclear physicists, worked on the technical aspects of the JCPOA according to which Iran slows down its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of financial and economic sanctions on Tehran. The ISA was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran’s energy industry. The extension was passed unanimously on Thursday by Senate. The ISA was first approved by the House of Representatives. Salehi expressed concerns over the extension of the ISA for another 10 years, saying Iran has the right to respond properly if the ISA is implemented. Moniz said the U.S. president will prevent the implementation of the parts of the ISA which runs contrary to the JCPOA.
Moniz said that U.S. President Barack Obama will be informed about Iran’s concerns in this regard. He also said his government will be committed to the JCPOA. According to IRNA, Moniz said the U.S. president will prevent the implementation of the parts of the ISA which runs contrary to the JCPOA. Salehi and Moniz are in Vienna to attend the International Conference on Nuclear Security: Commitments and Actions. The conference is arranged by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It started from December 5 and lasts until December 9.
