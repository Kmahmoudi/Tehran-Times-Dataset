TEHRAN - Iran’s Judiciary Chief Sadeq Amoli Larijani said on Monday that any effort to undermine the country’s missile capability will constitute an example of “betrayal”. “Undermining and questioning missile, security and military achievements under the pretext of freedom of expression are betrayal of the country and ideals of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the top judge said during a meeting with senior Judiciary officials. He urged the country’s attorneys to counter against any acts and moves in this respect. The remarks by the Judiciary chief followed a statement by the Supreme Leader on Wednesday who said, “If the Islamic system pursues technology and negotiations without defense power, then this will be a retreat in the face of threats from other insignificant countries.” Iran has repeatedly said that its missile program is just for defensive purposes. Larijani also said questioning the country’s defense capabilities and the system’s ideals and principles is not “fair”. He expressed hope that the Iranian people and officials would take step on the “path of unity and solidarity” given the guidelines set by the Leader. Abbas Araqchi, deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs who played a key role in negotiating a nuclear deal with great powers in July 2015, also told a TV program late on Saturday that Iran’s missile program is a “national and defense” issue which the Islamic Republic will not negotiate or compromise on it. In comments posted on his tweeter last month Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also said if Iran had missiles former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein may not have invaded the nascent Islamic Republic in 1980. Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan also said recently that Iran’s missiles were designed to carry only conventional warheads. “And Iran will never seek (to build) unconventional weapons,” Dehqan asserted. Elsewhere, in his remarks Larijani said Iran will not compromise on its national interests and will not accept foreign interference at any cost. The Islamic Republic of Iran will resist “illegitimate demands” of the hegemony, he added. “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s, being an example for the Islamic countries, has posed a serious danger against the Western hegemonic governments and they resort to any method and instrument to undermine the system,” Larijani said. He said that the hegemonic governments are well aware of the fact that the Islamic system will not compromise on its values.   NA/PA                   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
