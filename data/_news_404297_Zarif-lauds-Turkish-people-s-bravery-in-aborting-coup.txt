TEHRAN – The Iranian foreign minister has praised the Turkish people for their bravery in aborting military coup in Turkey. “Turkish people's brave defense of democracy & their elected government proves that coups have no place in our region and are doomed to fail,” Zarif wrote on his tweeter.
Zarif also said he is “deeply concerned about the crisis in Turkey.”
The military coup appeared to crumble in the early hours of Saturday after crowds answered President Tayyip Erdogan's call to take to the streets to support him.
Erdogan, who had been holidaying on the southwest coast when the coup was launched by a faction in the armed forces, flew into Istanbul before dawn on Saturday and was shown on TV appearing among a crowd of supporters outside Ataturk Airport.
Iran’s chief diplomat said, “Stability, democracy & safety of Turkish people are paramount. Unity & prudence are imperative.”
According to Reuters, Erdogan said the coup was an "act of treason," and those responsible would pay a heavy price. 
65 people killed 
Sixty people died during overnight clashes, many of them civilians, and 754 soldiers were arrested, BBC quoted officials as saying.
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the situation was largely under control.
He has ordered the military to shoot down aircraft being used by coup plotters.
Earlier, one of the helicopters being flown by forces involved in the coup attempt was shot down over the capital Ankara.
Meanwhile, the whereabouts of the military chief of staff, Gen. Hulusi Akar, are still unknown. He is reported to have been taken hostage by rebel soldiers.
Gen. Umit Dundar, commander of the 1st Army, has been appointed acting chief of staff.
Istanbul's main Ataturk airport is now under army control, and flights - which had been interrupted for some hours - were due to resume from 06:00 (03:00 GMT).
In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry said the coup attempt "was foiled by the Turkish people in unity and solidarity. Our president and government are in charge".
"Turkish Armed Forces was not involved in the coup attempt in its entirety. It was conducted by a clique within the armed forces and received a well-deserved response from our nation."
U.S. President Barack Obama urged all parties in Turkey to support the "democratically elected government".
NATO also called for "full respect" for Turkish democratic institutions. European Council President Donald Tusk also said Turkey was "a key partner for the European Union".
