If the web performance of an institution is below the expected position according to their academic excellence, university authorities should reconsider their web, open access, and transparency policy, promoting substantial increases in the volume and quality of their electronic publications. The Webometrics Rank of a university is strongly linked to the volume and quality of the contents it publishes on the Web. Size (number of pages) of the main web domain of the institution (presence), number of external networks (subnets) originating backlinks to the institution's webpages (impact), number of citations from top authors according to the source (openness), a and number of papers amongst the top 10% most cited in 26 disciplines (excellence) are the factors deciding universities’ ranking in Webometrics. Harvard University, Stanford University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are the top three ranking universities worldwide in Webometrics.  THE ranking 2020 In June, Times Higher Education (THE) Asia University Rankings 2020 ranked five Iranian universities among the top 100 universities worldwide. The Times Higher Education Asia University Rankings 2020 use the same 13 performance indicators as THE World University Rankings, but they are recalibrated to reflect the attributes of Asia’s institutions. The number of Iranian universities has risen from 29 in the Asian Times 2019 rankings to 40 in 2020 (the number of universities in the ranking has risen from 417 to 489). In 2019, four universities in the country ranked below 100 in Asia, while in 2020 this number reached five. However, Iran's best ranking in 2019 was 43rd, but this ranking rose to 48th in 2020. In 2020, Iran had 40 universities among the top Asian universities, which was 29 in 2019, 18 in 2018, and 14 universities in 2017. Leiden Ranking 2020 The Center for Science and Technology Studies Leiden Ranking has placed 36 Iranian universities in the list of over 1,000 major universities worldwide in 2020 compared with 26 universities in 2019. The ranking is prepared based on the indicators of scientific impact and collaboration. Leiden Ranking system, unlike other ranking systems in the world, does not calculate single rankings for universities in its system, but universities are ranked in all criteria and indicators in the Leiden system, Mohammad Javad Dehghani, head of the Islamic World Science Citation Center (ISC), said. With the presence of 36 universities in this ranking system, Iran, as in previous years, ranks first among Islamic countries in terms of the number of top universities.
