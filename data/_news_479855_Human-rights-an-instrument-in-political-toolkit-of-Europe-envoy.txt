TEHRAN - European nations have come under fire from Iran's ambassador to Austria for using human rights as a political tool against other countries. Abbas Bagherpour Ardakani slammed European nations for remaining mute on Saudi Arabia's and Israel's activities on his Twitter account on Saturday. “To the Europeans: Have You ever summoned any Israeli regime’s rep. for their persistent brutal crimes against children & women? or others whose government executed 81 people in a single day? Surely not, since Human Rights is just a tool in your political toolbox!” the ambassador tweeted. In the end, Baqerpour used the hashtag #DoubleStandards. European nations have sanctioned Iran in recent weeks over what they allege are human rights abuses relating to the country's handling of recent riots as well as the unfounded allegation that Iran had sent drones to Russia for use in the conflict in Ukraine. Iran has vigorously denied the accusations of human rights breaches, asserting that it dealt with organized riots supported by foreign governments to sow discord inside the country. The claims of drone sales to Russia during the Ukraine war have also been denied by Iran. As part of its defense cooperation with Moscow, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said Iran had sold a few UAVs to Russia before the outbreak of the conflict.
