TEHRAN – A rioter convicted of killing two Basij members in Mashhad’s recent unrest was hanged in the public early on Monday morning. The rioter, Majid Reza Rahnavard, has reportedly been convicted of killing Hossein Zeinalzadeh and Danyal Rezazadeh, the two members of the Basij who were stabbed to death on November 17 during unrest that erupted in the wake of the death of Mahsa Amini.  Rahnavard was charged with Moharebeh, which means waging war against God and Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and usually results in receiving the death penalty.  This the second execution in connection with the Mahsa Amini unrest and the first carried out in the public.    On Thursday, the Judiciary executed a rioter who had blocked Sattar Khan Street in Tehran. The rioter, Mohsen Shekari, was convicted of Moharebeh. Following the execution of Shekari, the West leveled huge criticism against the Islamic Republic. They accused Iran of violating human rights, a charge Iran roundly denied. Seyed Majid Mir-Ahamadi, the Deputy interior minister for security and police affairs, has reacted to criticism against Iran for executing Shekari, saying the enemy’s propaganda in this regard aims to prolong the unrest. He said the people have demanded that the Judiciary to put on trial the rioters and the Judiciary has done so.  He made the remarks in an interview with Fars News.  The security official said the enemy’s propaganda against the Judiciary is natural because they want the rioters to act freely.  He pointed out the implementation of sentences against rioters has caused them to feel that they cannot allow themselves to continue their crimes. In reaction to a series of tweets by Western officials who reacted harshly and angrily to the execution of Shekari, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said late on Thursday that the Judicial system in Iran “has employed proportionate and standard anti-riot methods.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
