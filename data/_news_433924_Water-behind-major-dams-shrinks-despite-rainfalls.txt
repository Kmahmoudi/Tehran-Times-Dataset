TEHRAN – Sixty two large dams constituting 35 percent of the total water behind dams are retaining water by less than 40 percent despite recent above normal rainfalls, IRNA reported on Sunday. Precipitation amounts in the current water year (starting on September 23, 2018) have jumped three-fold compared to the same period a year earlier, but rainfall fluctuations have made the water resources stored behind the dams in an undesirable condition. According to the Iran Water Resources Management Company, water in 62 major dams in different provinces accounts for less than 40 percent, which are supplying drinking water. Other 44 dams being used for agricultural purposes equivalent to 25 percent of the country's dams are retaining over 90 percent of water. Moreover, some 19 percent of the total dams amounting to 34 dams, are filled with water. Iman Babaeian, head of the climatological research institute affiliated to Iran’s Meteorological Organization said that since the beginning of the current crop year (starting on September 23, 2018), Iran has received 166.6 millimeters rainfall while the long-term averages are 130.8 millimeters which indicate a 27.3-percent increase in mean precipitation nationwide. Over the same period last year, the average precipitation level of the country has been recorded nearly 59.9 millimeter, which also shows 178.1 percent increase compared to the corresponding period this year, he stated. Despite the country's rising rainfall, most of the provinces in southern and south-eastern Iran have faced 20-85 percent drop in mean precipitation since last month, he lamented, adding, such condition indicates climate change rapid growth.
