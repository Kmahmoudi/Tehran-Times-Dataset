TEHRAN – On Saturday, Iran unveiled a long-range surface-to surface cruise missile designed and built by experts at the Defense Ministry’s Aerospace Industries Organization. The missile, with a flight range of more than 1,350 kilometers, was showcased as Iran is marking the 40th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The cruise missile, called “Hoveyzeh”, was put on display and prepared to be handed over to the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force.  Hoveyzeh is the name of a city in southwestern province of Khuzestan known for its resistance during Saddam Hussein’s war against Iran in the 1980s. Speaking at the ceremony, Defense Minister Amir Hatami described the missile as “a symbol of self-confidence” and said it is a major defense achievement that indicates Iran’s advances in military technologies.    The missile proves that nothing can block the Iranian nation’s determination to develop its defense sector, the minister added. Elsewhere in his remarks, General Hatami pointed to another domestically made cruise missile dubbed “Soumar” that had been unveiled earlier and has a range of 700 kilometers. Soumar is also the name of a village in Khuzestan whose inhabitants were all killed with chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein’s army. Iranian military experts and technicians have in recent years made great headways in manufacturing a broad range of indigenous equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient in the arms sphere. Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the country will not hesitate to strengthen its military capabilities, including its missile power, which are entirely meant for defense, and that Iran’s defense capabilities will be never subject to negotiations. Back in February 2018, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for efforts to maintain and boost Iran’s defense capabilities, hitting back at the enemies for disputing the country’s missile program. “Without a moment of hesitation, the country must move to acquire whatever is necessary for defense, even if the whole world is opposed to it,” Ayatollah Khamenei said at the time.
