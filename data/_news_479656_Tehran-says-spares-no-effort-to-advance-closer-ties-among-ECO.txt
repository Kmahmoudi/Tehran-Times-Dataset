TEHRAN- Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said on Sunday that the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) has a high reputation in Iran, noting the Islamic Republic spares no chance to encourage close ties among member states. Delivering a speech at an event commemorating the 30th anniversary of the ECO foundation, Amir Abdollahian said that Iran has always lived up to its commitments regarding ECO.    The ECO secretary general, foreign ambassadors, and related authorities took part in the ceremony.  “It is my pride to congratulate the 30th anniversary of ECO establishment on behalf of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, to the esteemed member nations and governments, the revered secretary general of ECO, and his respected colleagues. Also, the dear guests at this blessed anniversary are most welcome,” underlined the Iranian foreign minister. He asserted that the incorporation of seven additional nations into the ECO in 1992 marked a turning point in the organization's history. “The Islamic Republic of Iran as one of the founders of ECO, and the host country of ECO Secretariat, attaches great importance to that international organization, which is why Iran broadly welcomed the joining of those seven major peripheral countries to this organization,” Amir Abdollahian remarked.  “One of the priorities in Iran's economic diplomacy is the strengthening and expansion of economic ties with its neighbors, the region, and Asian nations.”  The chief diplomat added, “Multilateral and regional organizations, like ECO, have a significant role to play in this regard as facilitators and accelerators of bilateral and multilateral cooperation.”  The presidents of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey established ECO, an Asian political and economic intergovernmental organization, in Tehran in 1985. It serves as a discussion forum for methods to enhance development and promote trade and investment possibilities.  In 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, ECO extended to include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
