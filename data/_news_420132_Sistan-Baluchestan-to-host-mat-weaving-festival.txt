TEHRAN – Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province will host a national mat-weaving festival on January 29. The event will be staged in Tangeh-Sarhad village, Nikshahr county, with the aim of promoting the ancient skill being practiced widely in southern parts of the country, IRIB reported on Sunday. Matting is the art of weaving or plaited strips of organic fibers into various baskets and flooring pieces, which are deemed as comfortable and suitable for hot tropical climates. Dozens of high-quality Iranian handicrafts have been honored with the UNESCO Seal of Excellence over the past couple of years. PHOTO: An Iranian artisan makes mat baskets.
