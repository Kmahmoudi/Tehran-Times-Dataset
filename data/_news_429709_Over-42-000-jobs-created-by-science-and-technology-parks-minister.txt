TEHRAN – Over 42,000 jobs have been so far created by the science and technology parks located at universities, Science, Research and Technology Minister, Mansour Gholami, said on Saturday.  “There are a total of 43 science and technology parks at the universities across Iran,” he said. The parks and incubator centers support new ideas, entrepreneurship development and sustainable jobs, he said. In general, universities are not responsible for job creation for alumni, he said. “However in recent years, the science ministry provide a plan for increasing skill and entrepreneurship, according to which, the universities hold workshops and courses for the students during education,” he said. Over five thousand knowledge-based companies are active in Iran’s science and technology parks, Gholami said in early September.
