TEHRAN- Iran produced 19.791 million tons of crude steel during the first eleven months of 2017, with a 31.9 percent rise from the same period of time in the past year, according to the World Steel Association (WSA).
 The WSA also put the country’s crude steel output at 1.952 million tons in November, indicating 1.8 percent growth from 1.917 million tons in October. Iran’s crude steel output stood at 18.466 million tons in the past Iranian calendar year 1395 (ended on March 20), showing 11 percent rise from 16.656 million tons in 1394. The country exported 5.5 million tons of crude steel in the past year, with 27 percent increase from the figure of its preceding year. Iranian Steel Manufacturers Association’s Secretary Rasoul Khalifeh-Soltan believes that while the country’s steel industry’s growth has been 5.7 percent on average in the recent years, the figure can reach 10 percent this year, given the promising condition the sector enjoys at present. Iran’s 1404 (March 2025-March 2026) Outlook Plan has envisaged the annual crude steel production of 55 million tons which can elevate the country’s rank to the seventh globally.
