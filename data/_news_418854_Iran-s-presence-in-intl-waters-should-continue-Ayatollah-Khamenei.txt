TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei insisted on Tuesday that the presence of the Iranian navy in international waters should continue unabated.
 “The Navy is in the frontline of defending the country” and it is tasked to safeguard “important regions such as Makran, the Sea of Oman and the international waters and its presence in international waters should continue like before,” the Leader said during a meeting with commanders and officials of the Army naval forces. Ayatollah Khamenei also highlighted the necessity of boosting the navy’s capabilities. “Today, the navy is more advanced and powerful than it was in 20 years ago, however, this level of progress is not enough and fast-paced movement should continue through will-power, high morale, creativity and action in all departments,” he said. Elsewhere in his remarks, the Leader praised the performance of the Navy in the Persian Gulf in the early days of Saddam Hussein’s war against Iran in the 1980s.    “Courageous operation of the navy against the Ba’ath army on November 28, 1980 had lasting effect on war and that courage, creativity, planning, and action reduced domination of enemy over sea to zero.” Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, the new commander of the Iranian Navy, said in a televised interview aired on Monday that the Navy is now preparing to start missions in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Former Navy chief Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari has said Americans are “surprised” when they notice Iran’s presence in free seas.
