TEHRAN â€“ Chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee says the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe could have been resolved if the British government had not interfered. Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh said Zaghari-Ratcliffe could have been pardoned according to the principle of Islamic clemency if there were not such interferences, ISNA reported on Sunday. Britain and some European countries turn cases which have legal and judicial aspects into political issues, he lamented. Falahatpisheh added that politicizing such cases backfires when countries like Britain get themselves involved in them. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, has been imprisoned in Iran for 2 years on charges of trying to orchestrate a soft overthrow of the Islamic Republic.
