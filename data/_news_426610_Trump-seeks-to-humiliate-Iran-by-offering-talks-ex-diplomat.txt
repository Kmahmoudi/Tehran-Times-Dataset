TEHRAN - Hamid Reza Asefi, a former Iranian diplomat, has said that U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to humiliate Iran by proposing negotiation with the Islamic Republic.
 “He seeks to humiliate the Islamic Republic and say that he brought the Iranians to the negotiating table,” he told Fars news agency in an interview published on Friday. He noted that Trump sought to cause division inside Iran through his psychological warfare. In a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on July 30 in the White House Trump said he is ready to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without any pre-conditions. The remarks drew many remarks from Iranians as well as international politicians. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that there will be no war between Iran and the U.S. and nor will be any negotiation between the two countries. The Leader added as Imam Khomeini “banned talks with the U.S. and I also ban it”. He noted that negotiation with the current U.S. administration is impossible. “Even if we were to negotiate with the U.S., we would never hold talks with the current U.S. administration.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
