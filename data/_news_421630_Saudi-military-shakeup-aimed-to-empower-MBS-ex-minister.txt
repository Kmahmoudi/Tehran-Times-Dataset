TEHRAN – Former Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia’s military shakeup is aimed at paving the way for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) to sit on the throne. They dismiss anyone who is not loyal to their rule, Dehqan said in reference to King Salman and his son Mohammed bin Salman, ISNA reported. The state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said King Salman replaced a number of top military commanders in a late-night political reshuffle on Monday that saw the country’s monarch issue 39 royal decrees.
