TEHRAN – Ali Akbar Salehi, chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, arrived in Vienna on Sunday to participate in the 60th General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), IRNA reported.  The annual conference is set for Sept. 26-30 at the Vienna International Centre (VIC), where high-ranking officials and representatives from IAEA member states will consider a range of issues. At the meeting, IAEA members will deliberate on the agency's work in the previous year, set priorities and review budgetary matters. At the opening session, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano will report on the IAEA's work and achievements since last year and also mark the major achievements of the body since its establishment 60 years ago. Earlier this year, Amano invited Iran to participate actively in the agency’s activities and meetings following the implementation of the JCPOA, a nuclear deal that was clinched between Iran and six world powers last year. Amano stressed that the IAEA has found “no indication of diversion in Iran’s nuclear program” since the official implementation of the JCPOA on January 16, 2016.
