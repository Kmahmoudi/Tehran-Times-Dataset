TEHRAN- Iran’s domestic Forex Management Integrated System (locally known as NIMA) has supplied €6.276 billion of foreign currency for imports of goods and services since early August, IRIB reported on Thursday. The system has earned €7.141 billion of foreign currency from exports during the mentioned time span. NIMA, which seeks to boost transparency, create competitiveness among exchange shops and a secure environment for traders, is a new chance for importers to supply their required foreign currency without specific problems and for exporters to re-inject their earned foreign currency to domestic forex market. It was inaugurated to allow exporters of non-oil commodities to sell their foreign currency earnings to importers of consumer products.
