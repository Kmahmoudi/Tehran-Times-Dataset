TEHRAN – The National Museum of Iran is set to showcase loan collections from Armenia, South Korea and the Louvre Museum by the end of the current Iranian calendar year, March 20, 2018. The collection from South Korea will be made up from over 100 artifacts that date from the Silla dynasty (57 BC – 935 CE), one of the world’s longest sustained kingdoms that located in southern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula. It will go on display in the month of Aban, starting October 23, IRNA quoted the museum’s director Jebreil Nokandeh as saying on Wednesday.  Borrowed from the Museum of Armenia, the Armenian collection contains 103 artifacts dated from Iron Age kingdom of Urartu which is believed to be part of common history and heritage of the two neighboring nations. It will be put on show in an exhibit titled “Armenia and Iran: Memory of The Land”, which will be running from October 17 to January 17, 2018, ISNA reported. To fulfill an agreement the National Museum of Iran and the Louvre Museum reached in 2016, some 24 pieces of art, selected from various cultures such as Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, are projected to go on display in the month of Esfand, starting February 20, 2018. Located in downtown Tehran, the National Museum of Iran is somewhat chock-full of priceless relics that represent various eras of the country’s rich history.
