TEHRAN – A number of editors and editors-in-chief from the Iranian media outlets issued a statement on Friday condemning a suicide attack on the Afghan Voice news agency.
 The attack on Voice news agency and the Tebyan center in Kabul on Thursday left at least 41 people dead. The so-called Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. “Terrorist attack on the Afghan Voice news agency and the Tebyan center for social and cultural activities shows frustration of Takfiris following their defeats in the region. It also indicates the role of media and their Islamic discourse,” the statement read. It said since the Takfiri ideology has terribly failed to disintegrate the regional countries it is making efforts to “remove the main source of awareness and voice of reality as the most important impediment.” The statement added, “We announce that such terrorist acts, which are supported by the West, will not be able to silence the voice of truth.” The media statement was signed by editors and editors-in-chief of Tehran Times, Sobh-e-No, Quds, Farheekhtegan, al-Vefagh, Resalat, and Kayhan newspapers; ABNA, Tasnim, Fars, ANA, RASA, Hawzah, Defa Press, and BASIJ news agencies; Mashregh News and Islamic Awakening websites; Asr-e-Andisheh monthly; and Beit-ul-Moqaddas weekly.
