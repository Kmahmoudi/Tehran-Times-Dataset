TEHRAN – Iran’s nine-month gas extraction from the giant South Pars gas field (which the country shares with Qatar in Persian Gulf) has reached 109.496 billion cubic meters (bcm), IRNA quoted an oil official as saying on Friday. According to Masoud Hassani the managing director of South Pars Gas Complex (SPGC), the volume of processed natural gas in SPGC’s refineries also witnessed a 22.7 percent increase during the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-December 20) compared to the same period of time in the past year.
The official noted that in the said time span, more than 87.61 bcm of sour gas was sweetened in the complex’s refineries and some 356,000 tons of sulfur was also produced.
“Over 141 million barrels of gas condensate were also produced which is 16 percent more than last year’s nine-month figure,” he added.
During the first six months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-September 21), SPGC exported 76 million barrels of gas condensate to the world markets, a 25 percent rise compared to the same period last year.
In the mentioned six months, SPGC has sent 1.35 million tons of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to other countries as well. EF/MA
