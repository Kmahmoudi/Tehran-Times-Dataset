TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Saturday that Iran is the “safest” and “most transparent” country for economic cooperation.
 “European partners of Iran should know that Iran is the safest and most transparent country for economic cooperation, because it relies on people for making economic and scientific advances, and the people have guaranteed their peace and security in spite of all the sanctions, war(s) and terrorism,” he said during a speech at the 4th Iran-Europe economic and banking ties. He pointed to long history of relationship between Iran and European countries and said ties, especially in banking area and oil and gas industry, should be normalized as soon as possible. Zarif also attached great importance to using the post-nuclear opportunities to boost the national economy. Since the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), went into force in Jan. 2016, Iran has been seeking to attract foreign investment to prop up its economy.  According to the deal, brokered between Iran and great powers and the European Union, financial and economic sanctions must be lifted and Iran must also put limits on its nuclear activities. “Steps on the path of resistance economy can be taken through implementing the JCPOA. The diplomatic apparatus is ready to cooperate with private and state-run sectors to help the country’s progress and development,” the foreign minister explained. He also criticized the former government’s policies which led to “banditry” of the central bank’s assets by the United States. “If the then managers understood better the concept of ‘torn papers’, Iran’s properties would not be target of the U.S. banditry,” the chief diplomat noted. In December 2006 former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad rejected a UN sanctions resolution against Iran as “a piece of torn paper”. NA/PA
