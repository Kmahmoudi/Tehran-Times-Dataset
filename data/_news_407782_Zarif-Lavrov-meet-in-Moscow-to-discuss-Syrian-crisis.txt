TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov held bilateral talks on Friday to discuss regional issues, including the Syrian crisis, and the further enhancement of Tehran-Moscow ties, IRIB reported. The two sides exchanged views on political solution to the Syrian crisis and discussed ways to defeat the takfiri terrorist groups that are actively operating inside Syria. Upon his arrival at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow on Friday morning, Zarif said political solution and a serious fight against terrorism are the only ways to save the war-torn country. “Unfortunately certain countries have always supported wars and military intervention in Syria,” Zarif noted. He added that those counties that “want peace and support the fight against takfiri groups in Syria, should be more coordinated in order to expand peaceful ways of ending the conflict.” The Iranian foreign minister emphasized that the aim of the Friday meeting was to meet that end. Lavrov, for his part, emphasized the importance of resolving the Syrian crisis through diplomacy. He also said during a trilateral meeting in which Iran, Russia, and Syria took part, “humanitarian aid and ways of preventing the flow of arms to the terrorists will be considered.” MH/PA
