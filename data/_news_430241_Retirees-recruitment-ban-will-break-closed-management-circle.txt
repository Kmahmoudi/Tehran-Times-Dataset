TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that ban on employment of the retired managers will “break the closed management circle”.
 “This is a very good law. This is one of those laws that we needed to have. This law, in fact, opens and breaks the closed management circle… It paves the way for the youth” to get managerial posts, Ayatollah Khamenei told his theology students. However, he said, there are managers who were employed when they were young and now they are experienced and there is no one to replace them. This is where they come to receive permission from the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist, the Leader added. He suggested that the parliament should revise the law so that they will not need to resort to the Leadership’s permission. Kazem Jalali, chairman of the Parliament Research Center, said on Tuesday that Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani has ordered a reformation of the law. “So, we are supposed to prepare a plan to reform the law according to the Leader’s view in cooperation with a group of the MPs, experts and researchers,” Jalali said.
