TEHRAN – The recent report by the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran has been met with strong objection in the country, what it branded as "unjust" and "politically motivated.” Many of the countries initiating and supporting the approach at the Human Rights Council are themselves suffering from "countless human rights problems and have a gloomy and inhumane rights record," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Thursday. At 34th session of Human Rights Council held in Geneva, Switzerland, Asma Jahangir presented a 40-page report on human rights condition in Iran, accusing the country of numerous violations. The UN rapporteur criticized Tehran over a range of allegations, including execution of juveniles, imprisonment of religious minorities, and torture of political prisoners, which Tehran rejects. Qassemi chided Jahangir for turning a blind eye to Iran's achievements in the area of human rights, adding that before the official release of the report, Tehran had provided comprehensive explanations in response to the allegations, none of which had been considered in the released document. Still, Iran will have "constructive interaction" with the new UN human rights rapporteur, the spokesman highlighted. Addressing the Human Rights Council, Deputy Foreign Minister for International and Legal Affairs Abbas Araqchi called for interaction and dialogue between nations and invited them to stop “playing politics with human rights issues".
 
“Inspired by its well-off historical, traditional and Islamic inheritance, the Islamic Republic of Iran continues its efforts towards promotion of human rights based on the recognition of an interactive and cooperative approach at different levels,” Araqchi was quoted as having said during the session. "Iran’s pledge to the promotion and protection of human rights remains authentic and somber, genuinely rooted in its enthusiasm to achieve the ambition of a brighter, better-off and more prosperous future for its citizens," he added.
