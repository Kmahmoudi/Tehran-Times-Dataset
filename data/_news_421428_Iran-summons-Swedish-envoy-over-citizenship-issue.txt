TEHRAN – The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday summoned Stockholm’s ambassador to Tehran Helena Sangeland after Sweden granted citizenship to an Iranian national found guilty of espionage for the Israeli Mossad spy agency. “Following the Swedish government’s unconventional move to grant citizenship to Ahmad Reza Jalali, a security convict, the Swedish ambassador to Tehran was summoned to the Foreign Ministry,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. Qassemi said the Islamic Republic voiced its “strong protest” over Sweden’s measure to naturalize an individual that had confessed to spying for Mossad about Iranian nuclear scientists, including two who were assassinated in 2010. The ministry said granting citizenship to Jalali was "unconventional, questionable and unfriendly". Iran does not recognize dual nationality.
