TEHRAN – Iran’s Kish Airlines has resumed flying to Oman's capital, Muscat, after a one-year halt. The airlines operates round-trip flights from the Persian Gulf island of Kish to Muscat on Saturdays and Wednesdays, MENAFN reported on Tuesday. Reestablishing the route provides a “good” opportunity for expanding mutual economic ties and lays the ground for increasing Omani arrivals in the country, Alireza Qaedian, an official with Kish Free Zone Organization said. Foreign nationals do not need visas for visiting the island, he noted. AFM/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
