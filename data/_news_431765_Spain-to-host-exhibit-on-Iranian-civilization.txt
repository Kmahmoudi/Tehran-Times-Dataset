TEHRAN – To enrich cultural scene between Tehran and Madrid, a Spanish museum will be hosting a loan exhibit on history of Iran.  Titled “Iran – Cradle of Civilization”, the loan exhibit made its debut at the Drents Museum in Assen, the Netherlands, where it was well received by museumgoers from June to November 2018. The scheme was approved by the Iranian government last week based on a proposal by the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, IRIB reported. The report, however, didn’t provide further information on the event.  “Iran – Cradle of Civilization” features earliest developments of agriculture and livestock farming from the very beginning to cuneiform clay tablets, gold beakers and ornaments, bronze weapons and beautifully painted ceramics associated with successive Iranian kingdoms.
