TEHRAN - Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, has reiterated Tehran’s position on the war in Ukraine, underlining that his country’s impartial position on the war remains unchangeable. “I am writing to you regarding the letter dated 21 October 2022 from the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Lithuania to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (S/2022/790) in which, Iran was referenced inappropriately, unwarrantedly, and unjustifiably in a joint statement by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic that was annexed to the abovesaid letter in connection with the Security Council briefing on the agenda item “Maintenance of peace and security in Ukraine” on 21 October 2022 (S/PV.9161),” Iravani said in a letter to the president of the UN Security Council.  “As stated clearly on numerous occasions, the Islamic Republic of Iran has maintained an impartial position since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine. This principled position has been consistent and remained unchangeable. As a country that had already suffered from an 8-year imposed war and aggression, Iran opposes any conflict or war anywhere in the world, including Ukraine and has consistently called for peace and an immediate end to the conflict in Ukraine,” he stated.  He added, “While reiterating Iran’s principled position vis-à-vis the conflict in Ukraine, I categorically reject the unfounded claims and irrelevant allusions made against my country in the abovementioned letter.” Facing continued allegations from the West regarding its position on the war in Ukraine, Iran’s mission to the UN issued a non-paper last month explaining the Islamic Republic’s position on the Ukraine war.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran's position on the Ukraine situation is clear, consistent, and unwavering, which has been pronounced since the start of the conflict. From the beginning, the Islamic Republic of Iran has always emphasized that all UN Members must fully respect the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as applicable international law, including sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. As a country that has experienced 8-year imposed war and aggression, Iran opposes any conflict or war anywhere in the world, including in Ukraine,” the mission said.  It added, “Iran has consistently advocated for peace and an immediate end to the conflict in Ukraine and expressed clearly that this crisis has no military solution, and building upon this belief, Iran has urged the parties in the conflict to exercise restraint, avoid escalating tensions, and engage in a meaningful process for settling their disputes through peaceful means while also addressing the root causes of the situation. At the same time, Iran has also rejected any unilateral sanctions, and/or pressure, as well as any provocative measures against one side that would only aggravate the situation and make reaching a peaceful resolution more difficult. Similarly, the West's extensive military support and supply of sophisticated weapons could not be intended to bring the war to a close, but rather to escalate the conflict and increase damage and destruction.” The mission noted, “Iran supports the ongoing efforts to find a peaceful solution to this conflict, and in this regard, our Foreign Minister contacted his counterparts from both sides on several occasions. Iran categorically rejects unfounded and unsubstantiated claims that Iran has transferred unmanned aerial vehicles for use in the conflict in Ukraine. Such claims are nothing but a propaganda apparatus launched by certain states to further their political agenda.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
