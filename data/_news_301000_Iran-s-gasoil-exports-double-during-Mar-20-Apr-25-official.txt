TEHRAN- Iran has exported the average of 9 million to 9.2 million liters of gasoil per day since the begging of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20) until April 25, according to National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (NIOPDC) Managing Director Seyed Naser Sajjadi.  As the official told the Mehr news agency, in the preceding calendar year (which ended on March 19, 2016), the figure stood at 4.5 million to 5 million liters per day and now the volume is almost doubled. Replacing more gasoil with natural gas as the feedstock of power plants and industrial units, due to upsurge in the country’s natural gas output, and also implementation of fuel consumption management programs count for the upturn in the exports of gasoil, he added. “Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan, and some countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus are among the buyers of Iran’s gasoil”, the senior official said adding, “Moreover, several shipments of gasoil have been sailed to international markets.” The contract for exporting two million tons of gasoil to Iraq will soon be inked to turn the neighboring country into largest buyer of the Iranian oil product, Mehr reported on Friday. Given that Iran possesses surplus capacity for the production and supply of gasoil, the export of the strategic oil product to neighboring countries and the Middle East region has been put on the agenda.
