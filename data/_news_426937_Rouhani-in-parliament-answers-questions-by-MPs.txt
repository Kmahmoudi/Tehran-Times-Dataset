TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday appeared before the Majlis to answer lawmakers’ questions, mostly regarding current economic situation. In four out of five questions, Rouhani failed to satisfy the MPS, and the case is probably going to be referred to the Judiciary. Lawmakers posed questions on his administration’s handling of economic issues, including a high unemployment rate, slow economic growth and a devaluation of national currency rial as well as smuggling of goods and foreign currency. The lawmakers were also critical of the continuation of banking sanctions against Tehran despite the 2015 nuclear deal -- under which those restrictions should no longer exit. Responding to the lawmakers’ questions, Rouhani defended his administration’s performance in two rounds and also called for unity among all forces to tackle the existing shortcomings. In his remarks, Rouhani said, “What is important for us is to join hands to tackle people’s problem. People do not want you ask me questions and me to deliver digits and numbers; to go on reading these notes. People do not want this. People know the pain, they do better than you and I do. People understand their economic problems day by day and second by second.” “It is not important whether you or I talk about feeling the fact that people’s lives have been laden with problems. And if we and you are thinking of transitory remedies, people will not have it.” In another part of his answers, Rouhani referred to America’s mounting pressure on Iran, saying, “We will not let America’s schemes turn out successful… We will not allow a bunch of anti-Iranians who have gathered in the White House today try to conspire against us.” He added, “The White House should not think it will be happy of the conclusion of today’s session. It should know that it will be utterly saddened by the conclusion of today’s session…. We have no fear either of America or of problems. We will get through problems well.” First assuming power in 2013, Rouhani's “Prudence and Hope” government has been credited with clinching a historical nuclear accord with world states only two years later. The agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), relieved the country of nuclear-related sanctions – including those imposed by the U.S., and was subsequently endorsed in the form of a UN Security Council resolution. In May, however, the U.S. left the deal in clear breach of its international obligations, and reinstated sanctions against Iran as part of its fresh campaign of economic pressure. A first round of the bans came in force earlier this month, while the second batch is due to take effect in early November. The Majlis has on several occasions called Rouhani’s ministers to account. Already this month, it has removed Labor Minister Ali Rabi’ei and Economy Minister Masoud Karbasian in back-to-back impeachments.
