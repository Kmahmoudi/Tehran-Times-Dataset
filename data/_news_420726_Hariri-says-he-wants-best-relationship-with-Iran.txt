TEHRAN – Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri has said he would like the “best relationship” with Iran, but added that Lebanon must deal with Iran. Hariri made the remarks in Davos during a panel at the World Economic Forum (WEF), CNBC reported. “I as a prime minister would like the best relationship with Iran, but I would like it to be, state to state. Not for somebody to invest in Lebanon without telling me on this issue, like Hezbollah or others. Iran presents a challenge in the region maybe, but dialogue also is a part of resolving this issue,” Hariri told the attendees. “Iran is a country that we need to deal with. Each nation must understand how it wants to deal with Iran,” he said. Hariri has taken a harsh stance toward Iran since he announced his resignation in November from Riyadh. He accused Iran of sowing “fear and destruction” in several countries, including Lebanon. Many thought that he was forced to do that by the Saudi Kingdom. After returning to Lebanon, Hariri rescinded his resignation. ‘Tehran-Washington conflicts bad for Iraq’ Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi also addressed the WEF, warning that any conflict between Tehran and Washington is bad for Iraq. Pointing to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, al Abadi said: “It is very important to keep it intact. Any claim between the U.S. and Iran, any conflict is bad for Iraq. The nuclear deal is beyond us but good relations between them is important. Through the cracks Daesh (ISIS) was able to come through. We don’t want any more polarization. It is bad for all of us in the region.” He said he asked all sides to keep their differences away from Iraq when helping the country.
