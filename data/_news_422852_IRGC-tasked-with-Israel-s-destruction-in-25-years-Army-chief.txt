TEHRAN – Chief of the Iranian Army Abdolrahim Mousavi said on Saturday that destroying the Zionist regime is one of the major tasks of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), calling for a concerted effort towards that aim. Speaking at a ceremony to commemorate the Iranian martyrs dubbed “Holy Shrine Defenders”, Major General Mousavi said the enemies have repeatedly failed to harm Iran through creating division between the IRGC and the Army, Mehr reported. He said all the Iranian military is united against enemies’ plots to cause rift among armed forces. The commander further said the IRGC is responsible for tackling cultural, political, economic, and social threats.
