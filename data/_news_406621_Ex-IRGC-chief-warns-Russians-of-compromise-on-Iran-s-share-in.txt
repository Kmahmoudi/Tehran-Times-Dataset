TEHRAN – Reducing the role of Moscow to providing air support to ground troops in Syria, the former IRGC commander has warned the Russians against being dragged into a deal with Washington which trims Iran’s “share” in Syria. Recently, the U.S. and Russia have moved closer to a more coordinated mission in Syria under the “Joint Implementation Group” (JIG) which allows for “integrated” yet specified air attacks by the two in the beleaguered country.  Moscow and Washington also announced on September 9 in Geneva an arrangement in Syria which brought about a ceasefire three days after, now appearing to be faltering. “Currently, there is an arrangement between the Americans and Russians. I hope the Russians are not deceived by the Americans by being dragged into a game that benefits Washington more or gives a smaller share to Iran,” said Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi on Thursday at a TV program.    Iran has been assisting the Syrian government and army in its advisory capacity, aligning with Russia in a war now five years and a half on.  Rahim Safavi, who is a senior advisor to the Leader on military affairs, appeared pessimistic about what is going on between Russia and Washington in Syria, drawing the attention of Iranian diplomats to any sort of appeasement between the two powers.  “Our politicians and foreign policy officials must be careful that the interests of Iran and its share are not ignored by the international players,” he cautioned.   Rahim Safavi’s remarks come weeks after Tehran and Moscow showed stronger determination to back the Syrian government with Iran allowing a squadron of Russian bombers and fighters conducted air strikes against militants’ strongholds in Syrian, flying from the Nojeh air base in Hamadan.    “The world of politics is not trustable and we should recognize that it is the interests and role of countries that matter in politics,” the military expert reminded.
