TEHRAN – Behrooz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), said on Wednesday Iran is planning to shore up cooperation with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) megaproject.
 In an interview with the Tehran Times, Kamalvandi said Iran will exchange knowledge with the ITER. The official's remarks come days after Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi and ITER Director General Bernard Bigot signed a confidentiality agreement, an initial step for future collaboration in the multi-national nuclear fusion project.  Describing the expansion of cooperation with ITER as a “long-time procedure,” he said it is “two-sided.” He went on to explain, “Iran will cooperate to share its know-how, and in return, the Islamic Republic will benefit from technology and information shared, as well.” Kamalvandi also said Iran and ITER have signed a non-disclosure agreement. “ITER usually signs a non-disclosure agreement or NDA with members to make sure they are not going to disclose classified information,” he said in English. He underlined that AEOI and ITER have also discussed how to boost cooperation step-by-step. Kamalvandi further noted that Iran is going to have incremental contribution to the international project. This is in commensurate with the budget appropriated. Elsewhere in his remarks, Kamalvandi said Iran is supposed to be an associate member, not a full member to the ITER. “With an associate status, we will have access to classified information,” he said. Kamalvandi also said Tehran is not willing to become a full member, because “if you are a full member you have to dedicate at least $10m every year as a membership fee and also dedicate national budget for buying equipment, instruments, installation and so forth.” He pointed out that the country is in the “right track.” MH/PA/AK All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
