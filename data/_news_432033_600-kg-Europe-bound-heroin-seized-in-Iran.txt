TEHRAN â€“ Intelligence Ministry's forces have seized a big cargo of heroin destined to Europe at a southern port, IRNA reported. In a statement on Saturday, the Intelligence Ministry said the cargo was adroitly embedded in four 40-feet containers, disguised as export commodities. Iran, which has a 900-kilometer common border with Afghanistan, has been used as the main conduit for smuggling Afghan drugs to narcotics kingpins in Europe. Despite high economic and human costs, the Islamic Republic has been actively fighting drug-trafficking over the past four decades, spending more than $700 million on sealing its borders and preventing the transit of narcotics destined for European, Arab and Central Asian countries.
