Chris Backemeyer, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Iran, has said that Iran is living up to the commitments it made as part of a nuclear agreement reached with six world powers in 2015.
 “On the nuclear side, so far, Iran has lived up to its commitments, and that’s a good thing,” Backemeyer said in a panel discussion at the Atlantic Council, the Council reported on Friday. Backemeyer’s comments are in sync with recent findings by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA’s confidential report, which was reported by Reuters, found: “Throughout the reporting period, Iran had no more than 130 metric tons of heavy water...Iran’s total enriched uranium (up to 3.67 percent purity) stockpile did not exceed 300 kg,” citing the nuclear deal’s limits on heavy water and enriched uranium. Iran and the 5+1 group - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany - finalized the text of the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in Vienna in July 2015. In July 2015, the UN Security Council turned the JCPOA into international law by endorsing a resolution, setting the stage for the lifting of the Security Council sanctions against Iran. The nuclear deal went into effect in January 2016.
