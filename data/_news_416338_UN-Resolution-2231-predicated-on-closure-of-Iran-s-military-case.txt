TEHRAN – An Iranian lawmaker said on Monday that the UN Resolution 2231 is predicated on the closure of Iran’s military case and its exclusion from the country’s nuclear case.
 International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano, in written words as well as in a meeting with Iranian MPs in the previous parliament (2012-2016), said that Iran’s military nuclear case is closed forever, said Abbasali Mansouri Arani, a member of the Majlis special committee tasked to monitor the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “Foreigners cannot, neither would we allow them, to make decision for us on issues that relate to the security of our country,” the parliamentarian asserted. Mansouri Arani made the statements in response to attempts by the Trump administration to bring Iran’s military sites under inspection by the IAEA. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, met with IAEA officials in Vienna on Wednesday for what she described as a fact-finding mission, which is part of President Trump’s review of the deal Iran made with world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions. After returning from Vienna, Haley said she had pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases. There is the belief that the U.S. is pushing for access to information that Iran does not want it to have. “We are encouraging the IAEA to use all the authorities they have and to pursue every angle possible” Haley said. On Wednesday, the Washington Post said Iran’s Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, complained to Amano that Haley’s visit was intended to sow doubt about the nuclear agreement. Successive reports by the IAEA have proven that is in compliance with its landmark agreement with six major powers and the European Union. SP/PA
