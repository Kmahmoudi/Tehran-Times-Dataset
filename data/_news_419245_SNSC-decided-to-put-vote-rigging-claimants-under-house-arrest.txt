TEHRAN – Judiciary spokesman Qolamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Monday that the house arrest of the opposition leaders, who claimed vote rigging in the 2009 presidential election, is a legal decision made by the Supreme National Security Council. Speaking at a press conference, Mohseni Ejei said the house arrest was put in place due to   national security concerns, Fars reported. Mehdi Karroubi, Mir Hossein Mousavi and his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, were placed under house arrest early 2011 after they insisted on their claims of vote rigging and called for protests. MH/PA
