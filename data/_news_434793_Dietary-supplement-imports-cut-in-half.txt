TEHRAN- Imports of dietary supplements decreased by 50% in the last Iranian [calendar] year (ended on March 20) compared to its previous year, announced the head of the natural products and food supplementary department at Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  According to Mahnaz Khanavi, last year was a good year for producers of food and dietary supplements in the country as the production improved significantly, IRIB reported on Monday.  A dietary supplement is a manufactured product intended to supplement the diet when taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid. A supplement can provide nutrients either extracted from food sources or synthetic, individually or in combination, in order to increase the quantity of their consumption. The dietary supplements’ sale in the country last year amounted to $190m, showing that this business could be a profitable industry, Khanavi noted.  “Over the last year, the imports of raw materials was also estimated at $35.7m,” she added.  “As the production of dietary supplements in the country has increased, we need to pay more attention to the products’ quality,” she remarked.  SJ/MQ/MG   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
