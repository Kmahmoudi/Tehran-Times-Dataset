TEHRAN – Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri, the deputy chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, on Saturday denied accusations that Iran was supplying arms to Houthi fighters in Yemen, saying the allegations show Washington’s officials are ignorant of Yemen’s missile technology. The remarks by the general came after the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, on Thursday showed the debris of a missile at a military base in Washington in which she claimed had been made by Iran and fired by Houthis at an airport in Riyadh on November 4.   “If the Americans knew of Yemen’s modern missile technology, they would have avoided making such absurd remarks,” Jazayeri said, Fars reported.  Jazayeri also said the U.S. cannot build consensus against the Islamic Republic and the resistance movement, urging Washington to stop its warmongering across the world.
