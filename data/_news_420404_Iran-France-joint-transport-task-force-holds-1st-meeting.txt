TEHRAN- The first meeting of Iran-France joint transport task force was held in Tehran on Tuesday, IRNA reported.  During this meeting, headed by Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan and the French Transport Minister's representative Christian Esse Ei, the two sides reviewed the previously accorded mutual contracts for the purchase of Airbus and ATR aircrafts as well as some other issues including radar purchasing agreement between the French company Thales and Iran Airports Company.
