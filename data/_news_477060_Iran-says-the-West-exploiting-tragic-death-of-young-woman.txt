TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Monday that Western officials along with their media outlets have been exploiting the tragic incident of the death of a young Iranian woman by backing rioters under the claim of support for the Iranian. “American and European political leaders, their news agencies, and Persian-language media outlets supported by the West have exploited the tragic incident of the death of a young woman and backed rioters and disruptors of the country’s national security under the motto of supporting the rights of the Iranian nation,” Kanaani wrote on his Instagram page. Kanaani added, “They left no stone unturned in this regard. However, they either took no notice of or belittled the presence of millions of people on the streets and squares of the country in support of the establishment and their country and in strong opposition to chaos.” On Sunday, millions of people in different cities including Tehran, poured into the streets to shun acts of violence by protestors who were using the death of Mahsa Amini to vent their anger the Islamic Republic establishment. The spokesman went on to say that the U.S. and some of its European allies have always adopted hypocritical and double standard approaches toward Iran, citing decades-long “inhumane sanctions” against the Iranian as an example. “It is better for those who claim to be advocating the rights of the Iranian nation to give up their bogus slogans and put an end to several decades of cruel and inhumane sanctions against the Iranian nation,” Kanaani stated. Protests have erupted in several Iranian cities over the death of Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman from Saqez. She died in a hospital on September 16 three days after collapsing at a police station in the capital Tehran. She and others had been detained by morality police to receive training on dress code rules. Though Iranian officials have vowed to clarify all circumstances surrounding her death, violent street protests have led to attacks on security officers and acts of vandalism. Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told a televised program that contrary to rumors forensic medicine had proven that Amini had suffered no blow to her head.
