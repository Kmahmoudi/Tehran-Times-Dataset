TEHRAN- Iran imported 66,196 cars valued at over $1.756 billion during the elevn-month period ended on February 19, IRNA reported on Wednesday citing the data by Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA).
 In last June, the Iranian government shut down the online auto import registration system saying that the import regulations are being revised. The system was run in late December 2017 and the government boosted import tariffs which seem to increase imported cars prices, but there are still controversies over the issue of tariffs in the country.
