TEHRAN - Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps second-in-command, said on Tuesday that lack of political wisdom in the U.S. can be easily noticed.
 “We are witnessing wane of political wisdom in the U.S. and lack of wisdom in the country,” Salami said during a ceremony. He added, “Today, the enemies’ front has faced defeats and consequences of frustration are obvious in their behavior and face. The Al Saud, the U.S. president, and France are examples of this.” The general said enemies have been focusing on psychological warfare and economic pressure against Iran. “Today, the Iranian nation are not scared and are becoming more powerful despite the enemies’ threats,” he noted. Trump withdrew the U.S. unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal in May and ordered sanctions against Iran. The first round of sanctions went into force on August 6 and the second round, which targets Iran’s oil exports and banks, were snapped back on November 4. Salami said on Saturday that the U.S. policies and strategies in the Middle East region have ended in failure. “The Iranian people have found their way in such atmosphere and are aware that the major powers have limited capabilities and give in to the reality if they face resistance.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
