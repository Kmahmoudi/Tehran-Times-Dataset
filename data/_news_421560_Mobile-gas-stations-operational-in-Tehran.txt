TEHRAN – An application, named Pido, has been rcently launched in Tehran, enabling users living in district 2 of the city to place orders online for gasoline to be delivered to them. Very much like ride hailing applications the user can put an order for gas by choosing his/her destination and the costs will be calculated depending on the location; once the user approves the order the nearest tank truck will transport the gas to the given location. It’s the first time that this idea is being implemented in the middle-east region, ISNA quoted Ehsan Jafar-Tabari, the executive director of the Iranian startup as saying on Sunday. Currently the application provides its services only in Tehran District 2 and has received a warm embrace by Tehraners, he said, adding that according to the plan, the service will cover all areas of Tehran by the end of spring. In the first phase, 50 tank trucks with 1,000 liters capacity have entered the fleet while this number will increase to 300 units by the middle of spring, he highlighted. The gas delivered by the application is sold at the same price as gas stations with an added cost charged for delivery services, he noted.
