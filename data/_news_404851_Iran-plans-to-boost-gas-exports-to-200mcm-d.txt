TEHRAN - Iran plans to increase gas exports to 200 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d), Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said, emphasizing that exports via pipelines to neighboring countries and the completion of LNG projects are prioritized. Addressing a conference which was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC), Zanganeh added that the capacity of gas refineries will reach one billion cubic meters (bcm) in the next Iranian calendar year (March 2017-March 2018). The NIGC director for international affairs, Azizollah Ramezani, said on July 25 that the country’s annual gas exports volume is projected to hit 68 bcm by the next five years through transferring gas via pipeline, mostly to neighbors.  According to officials, Iran has so far signed deals with Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, and Oman to export a total of 46 bcm of gas per year, but for the time being it only delivers to Turkey, while the country plans to export around 6 mcm per day of gas to Iraq in August. Domestic consumption of liquefied gas decreasing  Meanwhile, Zanganeh referred to the downward trend of liquefied gas consumption as fuel in domestic power plants in recent years, clarifying that while liquefied gas constituted 18 percent of power plants’ total fuel in the Iranian calendar year 1394 (March 2015-March 2016), the amount will be decreased to less than 10 percent by the end of the current year (March 20, 2017). 300 mcm/d added to South Pars output “As of taking office [in August 2013], the Rouhani administration has added mcm/d to the daily production of the South Pars gas field,” the oil minister boasted. Zanganeh said that since becoming online, the phases 12, 15, 16, and 17 of the South Pars gas field have added 160 mcm to the country’s refined gas production capacity and 140 mcm to the dry gas production capacity. “Phases 19, 18, 20 and 21 of South Pars gas field will become operational by the yearend,” he stressed. According to him, the South Pars field’s daily gas production stood at 241 mcm in 2012, at 262 mcm in 2013, and at 356 mcm in 2015. Over 3m tons of petrochemicals produced in 3 months Elsewhere in his remarks, the minister said that in the first three months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-June 20, 2016) more than 3.19 million tons of petrochemical products were produced by companies which were operating relying on gas as feedstock, while the figure stood at 2.8 million tons in the same period last year. “For the time being, industries do not have any problems with the feedstock and petrochemical production is on the rise,” he said. Self-reliance in oil, gas sector promotes national power: Rouhani Addressing the same event, President Hassan Rouhani said “Self-reliance in oil and gas sector will promote national power.”  Highlighting the role of oil and gas in the development of the country and also in its political relations with the globe as an OPEC member, Rouhani referred to the restrictions on Iran’s gasoline imports during sanctions era, saying that reaching self-sufficiency in production of crude oil and oil products, in particular gasoline and diesel, is vital for the  country.
