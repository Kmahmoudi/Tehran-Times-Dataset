TEHRAN- Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan announced that the deal with the world leading aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing will be finalized soon, Mehr news agency reported on Sunday. The official also anticipated that a number of the 111 aircrafts ordered to Airbus and 108 ones ordered to Boeing will be delivered to Iran by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017).
Following the implementation of the last year’s nuclear accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), between Iran and six world powers, Airbus and Boeing received permission from the U.S. government to sell aircraft to Iran.
European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on September 21, followed by Boeing’s announcement later in the day.
Iran has announced its need for about 400 passenger planes in the next decade to modernize its ageing fleet.
Iranian airlines are not interested in buying any more Russian planes. Their performance was unsatisfactory when flown in the country's aviation market during the sanctions period. Iran hopes to improve the relations with the world in the wake of the nuclear deal to renovate its fleet with western aircraft. MA/MG
