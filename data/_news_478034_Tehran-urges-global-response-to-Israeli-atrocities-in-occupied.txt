TEHRAN- In efforts to end the Israeli regime's brutality in the occupied Palestinian territories, the Iranian Foreign Ministry has denounced Israeli aggression against Palestinians in the West Bank city of Nablus. In a statement released on Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani condemned the "hypocritical and deceitful" stances of the United States and several Western nations on global human rights concerns regarding Palestine. The strongest illustration of persistent human rights abuses, he continued, is "their unflinching backing for the usurper Zionist regime and its daily atrocities against the oppressed Palestinian nation." Kanaani urged the world community to condemn and end the Zionist regime's genocide in Palestine by highlighting the persistence of Israeli atrocities and terrorist actions in the occupied West Bank, particularly its siege and attack on Nablus. He praised the young people of Palestine for their valiant resistance in al-Quds, Jenin, and Nablus and pleaded for assistance from the world for the Palestinian struggle against the Zionist regime until Palestine was fully freed from Israeli tyranny. Since October 11, the Israeli military has enforced a tight siege on Nablus, blocking its gates with military checkpoints and earth mounds while droning above the city in the northern West Bank. After an Israeli soldier was killed in a shooting incident near Nablus by the Palestinian resistance group Lion's Den, the region was put under siege. The city's economy has been affected by the siege, which Israeli officials say will last until further notice and which has significant industrial and commercial significance for the West Bank. Recently, Israeli soldiers have also begun carrying out midnight raids and assassinations in the northern West Bank, namely in the cities of Jenin and Nablus, where fresh bands of Palestinian resistance fighters have emerged. According to the Palestinian health ministry, Israeli troops have murdered at least 175 Palestinians since the start of the year in the illegally occupied West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip, including 51 Palestinians during Israel's three-day assault on Gaza in August. Both nationally and internationally, rights groups have denounced Israel's disproportionate use of force and "shoot-to-kill policy" towards Palestinians.
