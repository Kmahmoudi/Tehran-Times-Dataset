TEHRAN – The Seraj Cyberspace Organization plans to establish an e-mental health center for the first time in Iran. At the center, experts will treat patients suffering from internet- addiction disorder and mental problems caused by cyberspaces. “Nowadays everybody is aware of cyber ecosystem. Hence, we should put cyberspace challenges into perspective,” Ahmadreza Matinfar, an official with the organization, told Mehr on Sunday. The fast trend of technology requires elites to pave the way for people to cope with these changes, he added. He said that the center will be launched in Tehran but the organization plans to establish branches in other cities as well. Technology is often used in healthcare to control, detect, screen, or treat an illness. E-mental health uses the Internet and related technologies, like phone apps, to let patients receive care when and where they need it most, regardless of how close they live to their care provider.
