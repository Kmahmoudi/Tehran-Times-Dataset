TEHRAN - Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that the power of Armed Forces should be strengthened to maintain the nation’s invulnerability.
 “Today, the Armed Forces need the best human resources from intellectual and practical points of view who are firmly determined to be able to maintain the nation’s invulnerability towards animosities,” Leader said in a meeting with senior military commanders and distinguished participants at the Malek Ashtar Festival. He expressed satisfaction over the Armed Forces’ progressive move in the area of human resources by organizing the Malek Ashtar Festival. “Continuation of moving forward without any stop is necessary to be successful. So, work and make efforts incessantly at any sphere that a responsibility and duty is upon you to fulfil,” he said. The Leader described the naming of the festival after Malek Ashtar - a distinguished companion and commander of Imam Ali (as) - as erudite. Malek Ashtar was a prominent role model in “insight and knowing the right path”, “strong will-power”, “feeling responsible and readiness for acting for a cause”, “bravery and power of commanding” and at the same time in “spirituality, worship of God, piety and humbleness” and the commanders of the Armed Forces must follow these qualities more than others, he noted.
