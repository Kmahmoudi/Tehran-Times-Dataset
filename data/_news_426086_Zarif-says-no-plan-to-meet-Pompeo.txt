TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday that he has no plan to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Singapore.
 “The current U.S. administration has shown that it does not respect its commitments and holding meeting simply to meet has no sense,” he said. Zarif had visited Singapore to sign Iran’s friendship agreement with 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Foreign ministers from other countries including Pompeo attended the annual ASEAN summit hosted by Singapore.  There is no limit to “illegal policies” of the current U.S. administration and its “addiction to sanctions”, he added. “The whole world should come to the conclusion that such policies should be countered collectively,” Iran’s chief diplomat noted. Zarif said there is a situation in which even U.S. allies cannot trust Washington. On May 8, Trump’s White House withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear pact and ordered sanctions against Iran. Pompeo and John Bolton, two men very close to Trump, have also backed pullout from the international agreement. Zarif said the U.S. should be ready to hold talks based on respect and should also become aware that “pressure and dialogue do not go together”. Pointing to Trump’s offer for negotiations with Iran, Zarif said it was a “propaganda” and “not a political move”. Trump said in a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday that he is ready to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without setting any pre-condition. “It’s good for the country, good for them, good for us and good for the world. No preconditions. If they want to meet, I’ll meet,” Trump said.  NA/PA    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
