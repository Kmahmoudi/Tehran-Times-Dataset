U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged on Tuesday he and President Trump “have differences” on the nuclear deal with Iran, but claimed the Islamic republic was violating the spirit of the agreement with its activities. According to the Atlantic, Tillerson, at a news conference at the State Department, described his relationship with Trump as “good” and said he felt “comfortable telling him my views.” “He and I have differences of views on things like JCPOA and how we should use it,” he said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “But, I think, if we’re not having those differences, I’m not sure I’m serving him.” According to the JCPOA, Iran is obliged to limit its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of financial and economic sanctions. 
The International Atomic energy Agency, as the UN body tasked to monitor Iran’s compliance with the terms of the JCPOA, has confirmed six times that Tehran has fully honored its commitments under the deal. The deal signed in July 2015 went into force in January 2016. The agreement was brokered between Iran, the European Union, Germany, and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
