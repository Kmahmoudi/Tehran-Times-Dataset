TEHRAN – Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev will be in Iran for a formal visit in the near future, seeking stronger ties with the country.   Bunyad Hasanov, the Azerbaijani ambassador to Tehran, broke the story on Monday at an appearance with Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of the Iranian parliamentary committee for national security and foreign policy.  The two countries have seen bilateral ties growing particularly over the past few years as moderate, pragmatic Hassan Rouhani took over as 
president in 2013.  Growing bilateral trade and political consultation on a wide range of issues have contributed to drawing a roadmap for the future.  “Azerbaijan is keen to expand economic and trade cooperation with Iran,” Hasanov commented.  He said annual bilateral trade in 2016 showed a 45-percent rise, reaching $320 million.  A facilitative factor is common religious, cultural, and historical background.  The two presidents have already reciprocated visits, signing deals worth millions of dollars.  The Azerbaijani president has visited Iran two times, in spring 2014 and winter 2016.  AK/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
