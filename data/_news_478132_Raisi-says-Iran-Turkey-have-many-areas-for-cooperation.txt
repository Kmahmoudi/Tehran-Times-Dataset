TEHRAN – Iranian President Ayatollah Seyed Ebrahim Raisi has said that Iran and Turkey have many areas for expanding cooperation.  The Iranian president made the remarks in a message to his Turkish counterpart on the occasion of Turkey’s National Day.  “As two independent states that oppose unilateralism and enjoy ancient neighborly ties, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Turkey have abundant areas for expanding comprehensive relations,” Raisi said in the message, according to IRNA.  He also congratulated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on National Day of Turkey.  “Undoubtedly, the serious will of the two countries to fully implement the comprehensive long-term cooperation program draws a clear perspective for strengthening ties and realizing the common goals and interests of the two countries,” Raisi added.  The presidents of Iran and Turkey held a meeting in mid-September on the sidelines of the 22nd Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Samarkand. The presidents of Iran and Turkey, while reviewing the agreements made during the recent visit of the Turkish President to Tehran and holding the 7th Supreme Council of Economic Cooperation between the two countries, once again emphasized the need to speed up the implementation of these agreements. At the meeting, the two sides also discussed developments in the region, including the issues in Syria, Afghanistan, and the Caucasus. Noting the two countries’ opposition to “paternalism,” the president said, "The basis of our policy in the region is that the future of the countries is determined by them, and their national sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected.” Citing examples of Iran's support for friends and neighbors during different crises, the President clarified that Iran is a friend of its neighbors. In this meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasized the continuation of efforts to implement the agreements between the two countries.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
