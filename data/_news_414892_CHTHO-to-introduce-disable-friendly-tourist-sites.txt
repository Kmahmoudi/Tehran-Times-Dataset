TEHRAN – The Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization of Iran is working on a website that will provide information on destinations across the country which are suitable for disabled persons. The service will be available by the next two weeks, ISNA quoted CHTHO Director Zahra Ahmadipour as saying on Friday. “We are preparing a system that enables disabled people and mobility impaired travelers to be easily informed of well-equipped facilities for various destinations,” she said. Reminding a global motto of “Tourism for All”, the official explained that the new service is being launched in line with the fundamental citizenship rights. Everyone should be able to enjoy tourism capacities of the country regardless of his or her physical abilities, the official stressed. “Tourism for All” was chosen by the United Nations World Tourism Organization in 2016 to bring awareness to accessibility issues facing many travelers whether they be disabled, a family with children or senior citizens. With countless natural beauties, deeply-rooted-in-time history and culture, as well as abundance of tourist sites, 21 of which have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, Iran seeks to acquire greater share of the global tourism industry.
