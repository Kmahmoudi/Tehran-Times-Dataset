TEHRAN – Idriss Jazairy, the UN Human Rights Council’s rapporteur on sanctions, has said Europe does not approve of unilateral sanctions against Iran. Sanctions outside the UN framework are both illegitimate and illegal, said Jazairy, IRNA reported on Sunday. The sanctions create an atmosphere of fear which drives companies away from the countries under the sanctions, he said. He added that while a lot of companies are not willing to enter Iran’s market due to U.S. sanctions, certain companies, which do not seek to work in the U.S. market, might be willing to work with Iran.
