Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, has castigated the White House for backing Benjamin Netanyahu’s allegations about Iran’s nuclear program, saying the Trump administration is misrepresenting facts to justify an exit from the 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the JCPOA. “Factually incorrect White House statement on Iran nuclear program either evidence of lack of rigorous national security process or (and much worse) the politicization of intelligence, ie, the deliberate misrepresentation of the facts in order to justify breaking up the JCPOA,” Haass tweeted. Immediately after Netanyahu’s televised presentation on Iran’s nuclear program on Monday, the White House said, “Iran has a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons program.” PA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
