TEHRAN – Total’s Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné said his company plans to continue developing Iran’s South Pars gas field despite the U.S. threats to blow the nuclear deal. According to a report by Financial Times, Speaking in Washington Pouyanné said he was well aware of the difficulties they may face when he signed the multibillion-dollar deal in July to develop South Pars. “We knew when we signed that it will not be an easy road,” he said.
 
The official noted that Total is “committed to put the concrete agreement in place” to develop part of the South Pars gas field, which is the world’s largest and is shared by Iran and Qatar. Pouyanné said Total had not come under any pressure from the U.S. over its Iran business, and added that he had not spoken to any U.S. senators about the debate on the nuclear deal. “I don’t receive any order from the French government. I don’t receive any orders from the U.S. government,” he added. His comments came as Trump weighs whether to recertify on October 15 that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal. If the U.S. president does not recertify, congress has 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions.
