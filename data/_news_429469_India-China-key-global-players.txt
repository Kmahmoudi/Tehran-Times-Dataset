TEHRAN _Despite many contentious issues between them, India’s Defense Minister Nirmala Sithraman regards India and China as key players who are in the center-stage of all global developments. Delivering a talk on the topic ‘Towards bridging the Indo-China Relationship for an Emerging Asia’ on Sunday, Sitharaman said the ties between the two countries has direct and indomitable impact on everything global, therefore it will have to be ‘good’. She said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principle of five ‘S’s – Samman (Respect), Samwaad (Dialogue), Sahyog (Cooperation), Shanti (Peace) can usher in Sammriddhi (Prosperity) in the two Asian giants. “Today we both cannot deny each other’s significance and dominance, especially in Asia and South East Asia. Need of the hour is to cooperate with each other, resolve all issues through dialogue and progress as the 21st century is regarded as the Age of Asia,” she remarked. Through dialogues and meetings at the highest levels, she pointed, a mechanism is being put in place to resolve all issues. Sitharaman also delved on few key fields in which both the countries can cooperate and help each other besides trades. India and China, the two bulwarks of Asia and protagonists of new international economy policy, are touted as two staunch competitors. The two neighboring countries have been at loggerheads over border issues that many experts fear can affect their long-term relationship. And China’s growing proximity with Pakistan has also been a source of consternation for New Delhi.
