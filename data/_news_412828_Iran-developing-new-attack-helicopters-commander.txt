TEHRAN – Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Ground Force Airborne Unit has said that Iran is manufacturing homegrown attack helicopters equipped with state-of-the-art missile systems. In an interview with Tasnim news agency published on Saturday, General Mohammad Rahmani Qahroudi said the IRGC is currently working on several projects to manufacture helicopters and other weapons. General Qahroudi noted that his forces have concluded the research and designing phases of Shahed-278 and Shahed-285 helicopters, adding that the local manufacturer HESA will mass produce the helicopters. The state-of-the-art Shahed-285 helicopter is reportedly capable of taking part in sea and airborne combat operations. A homegrown missile system, dubbed Sadid, will be mounted on the helicopters, the general said, adding that the missile system has been well paired with the aircraft. Qahroudi also hailed the country’s progress in the field, saying that the Islamic Republic celebrates its considerable achievements in designing and producing arms and ammunition for the airborne unit. The Ground Force Airborne Unit was established as an independent branch of the IRGC in early 2016. Iran says its military might poses no threat to other countries as its defense doctrine is entirely based on deterrence. MH/PA
