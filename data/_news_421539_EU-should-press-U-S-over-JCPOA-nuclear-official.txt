TEHRAN – The spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) has called on European countries to put pressure on the United States regarding its lack of commitment to the nuclear deal, also called the JCPOA. Behrouz Kamalvandi criticized Washington for its anti-JCPOA measures and emphasized that all sides should be committed to the deal, IRIB news reported on Saturday. The call by Kamalvandi came after a quarterly report on Iran’s nuclear program by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which for the tenth times confirmed that Iran is fulfilling its obligations under the 2015 historic nuclear accord.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
