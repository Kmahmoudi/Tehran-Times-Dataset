TEHRAN- Yesterday, the historic win of the national team against Wales hit the headlines of almost all newspapers in Iran. Some looked at the match only as sport and football, while others went beyond and addressed it from a social and even political perspective. The conservative Farhikhtegan newspaper, affiliated to the Islamic Azad University, ran a title in which a reporter in Qatar wrote about the stadium atmosphere, the players and spectators. “Outside the stadium, it was more crowded than it was before the match began. The throng was going towards the exit doors, shouting “Iran-Iran”, as if they were connected to an infinite source of energy.  The stateless people, however, were standing aside intimidated by this national celebration. They tried several times to mourn with dance and joy, but there was no support, and if there was, it did not lead anywhere. Tonight, Iran is happier than ever, proud and eternal, now more hopeful than ever, we will stand in front of America,” the reporter claimed. Kayhan: Corrects its headline In its heading, the Kayhan newspaper, called the national team’s win “A victory against Wales, Israel, House of Saud and domestic and foreign traitors”. Hossein Shariatmadari, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper apologized for the headline of the last week after the match against England in which he blamed some national team players for not singing the national anthem. “We consider it necessary to correct” the Tuesday headline, “and we express our great appreciation for the national football team,” he wrote. Iran: The miracle of unity The state-run newspaper ran a big headline calling the victory against Wales “Miracle of Unity”. “The key to success in this great competition is also the key to the success of Iranian nation in realizing ‘strong Iran’. Whenever a nation builds a bridge to victory from failures with determination and perseverance and overcomes all the waves of despair and hopelessness, the realization of victory and pride in all national fields will not be farfetched,” Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Mohammad Mehdi Esmaeili wrote in the newspaper. “Just as the superiority in this competition was our right, the superiority and success in other areas of life is also the right of all the children of this land. Bringing Iran to a worthy place in the world is the right of all Iranians, and in order to realize this great goal, we all have to work hard and not to be afraid of small failures or getting disappointed.” He added, “The young footballers taught a great lesson to all Iranians and the whole world. They showed that the world should stand strong for the honor of Iran and say well done to all this effort, hope and zeal.” What can turn the countless talents and capabilities of the youth into pride is nothing but hope and believing in victory, the minister opined.  “For a hopeful nation, where there is a will there is a way.”  Etemad: Why does the U.S. spend money against the hijab? In a note, the reformist Etemad newspaper has warned the officials that they should not use the victory against Wales and the happiness of the people as a tool.  To improve the situation, the writer suggested, officials should make serious and fundamental changes in national policies. The newspaper has also conducted a detailed interview with Shahab Esfandiari, the head of Iran Broadcasting University, in which the issues of these days in Iran and hijab is discussed. It also pointed to the policies and views of the Islamic Republic in this regard. “Americans are upset about the progress of Iranian women in the Islamic Republic. In their plan, these events were not supposed to happen. Their desired image of Islam is ISIS and the Taliban. Why is the U.S. government paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a woman who preaches against the hijab? The U.S. government’s problem with Iran is the hijab law? Why do they pay an employee to spend 5 to 6 years focusing on one issue out of hundreds of women’s issues? Because they are looking for social tension and division,” Esfandiari said.
