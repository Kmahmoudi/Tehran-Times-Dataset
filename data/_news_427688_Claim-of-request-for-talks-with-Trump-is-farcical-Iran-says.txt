TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Friday that Iran has never requested meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.
 Reportedly, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has claimed that Iran had requested a meeting with Trump during the United Nations General Assembly which is scheduled to be held from September 18 to October 5. Qassemi described the claim as “farcical” and in line with a psychological warfare against Iran. In a press conference on Monday, Qassemi confirmed that President Hassan Rouhani will attend the annual UN meeting but said Iran does not even think about holding talks with the “naïve” Trump administration. “Given the naïve and uncivilized act of the current U.S. administration in withdrawing from the JCPOA [the official name for the 2015 nuclear deal) and also the country’s policies against Iran, we do not even think about negotiating with the U.S. let alone talking about the preconditions,” Qassemi stated.
