TEHRAN- Iran’s Supreme Court on Saturday dismissed an appeal by a rioter to revoke death penalty against him.   The court confirmed the death penalty against Mohammad Ghobadlou, who drove into police forces, killing one and injuring some others. Ghobadlou was charge with "corruption on earth", a conviction that carries death penalty under Islamic sharia. “I drove towards security forces deliberately in a bid to run them over,” he said in the court. In response to the death on September 16 of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died suddenly in hospital three days after fainting in a Tehran police station, protests erupted in a number of Iranian towns. Her medical condition was given as the cause of death, refuting claims that she had been beaten by police. However, the opportunists use the tragic death as an excuse to make violent attacks against police forces and commit acts of vandalism. So far, a number of armed forces and civilians have lost their lives because of such violent acts. The foreign based foreign television networks, including the Saudi-funded Iran International, have also been fanning the flames of unrest in Iran. The U.S. and its Western allies have received the most vitriol from the Islamic Republic for inciting the disturbances through their spies and media networks.
