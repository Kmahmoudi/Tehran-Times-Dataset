Despite Republican presidential contender Donald Trump's statement about the necessity of renegotiating the 5+1 nuclear deal with Iran, the U.S. Department of State’s Persian-language spokesman Alan Eyre says in an interview with Trend news agency any future U.S. administration will respect the Iran nuclear deal. Trump had earlier denounced the deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, saying he would seek to renegotiate it if elected president. Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced on June 1 that the nuclear deal, reached last year with the 5+1 group, can’t be renegotiated despite Trump's pledge to do so if elected. The JCPOA’s implementation began in mid-January 2016. “We believe that all sides will remain committed to the JCPOA,” said Eyre. “And as we have seen from press reports about the IAEA’s most recent report on Iran’s nuclear program, Iran continues to meet its commitments under the JCPOA.” “We are doing the same with respect to the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions,” he added.
