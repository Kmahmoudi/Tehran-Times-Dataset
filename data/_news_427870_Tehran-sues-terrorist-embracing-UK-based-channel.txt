TEHRAN – Iran has filed a lawsuit against the UK-based TV channel “Iran International” over the network’s support for a terrorist group involved in a Saturday attack on a military parade in Ahvaz.

 “The Iranian embassy in London has taken its official lawsuit to Ofcom to investigate the Iran International TV channel’s illegal move to broadcast an interview with the spokesman of the terrorist group,” Iranian Ambassador to London Hamid Baidinejad said in a Monday tweet. Baidinejad added that the embassy has separately requested the UK government to identify members of the terrorist group, ban their activity, and expel them from the country. The al-Ahwaziya group, which receives backing mainly from Saudi Arabia, claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack which took the lives of 24 people, including a four-year old child, and injury of 69 others. Shortly after the attack, the TV channel allowed the terrorist group’s spokesman to go live on air to justify the heinous crime.
