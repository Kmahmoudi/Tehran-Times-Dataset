TEHRAN – Regional aircraft manufacturer ATR says it must give up delivering the remaining aircraft ordered by Iran because of new U.S. sanctions and that it will try to reclassify 12 aircraft if it does not obtain a waiver. “In 2018, our delivery target could be impacted given the Iranian context,” Press TV quoted ATR CEO Christian Scherer as saying, citing LaTribune.fr. “Of the 80 planes we expected to deliver in 2018, there were 12 for Iran, that’s a lot,” said. Back in April 2017, Iran Air, the national flag carrier, signed a contract to buy 20 planes from turboprop maker ATR.
