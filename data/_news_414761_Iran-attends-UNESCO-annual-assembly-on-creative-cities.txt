TEHRAN – Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization Deputy Director Bahman Namvar-Motlaq participated in the 12th annual meeting of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN), which was held in Enghien-les-Bains, a commune in the northern suburbs of Paris, from June 29 to July 2. Iranian cities of Isfahan and Rasht were accepted to the UCCN on December 11, 2015. Isfahan is registered because of its creative ‘Crafts and Folk Art’ and Rasht because of its unique ‘Gastronomy.’  “Creativity towards sustainable cities: designing inclusive public spaces in the digital era,” was the central theme for the event during which attendees exchanged views on local and international objectives and indigenous projects, while scrutinized a platform of dialogue between the creative cities and UNESCO. “This gathering offers a unique occasion to strengthen the ties among cities from around the world and serves as a platform to define the strategic objectives of an expanded and well-balanced Network,” UNESCO announced days prior to the assembly. Launched in 2004, the network revolves around seven creative fields namely crafts and folk art, design, film, gastronomy, literature, media arts, and music. It aims to foster international cooperation with and between cities committed to investing in creativity as a driver for sustainable urban development, social inclusion and cultural vibrancy.
