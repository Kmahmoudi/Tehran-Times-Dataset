TEHRAN- A number of diplomats from countries member to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met on Monday with Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs. The ambassadors of Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and the chargés d'affaires of the Philippines and Thailand were present at the meeting. Pointing to the great potential of Asian states, Bagheri Kani said ASEAN has provided an adequate capability to foster economic cooperation among Asian nations. Iran’s deputy foreign minister said economic cooperation will help peace and stability in the region and rob the opportunity from foreigners to intervene in regional affairs. Elsewhere in his remarks, Bagheri Kani said the Western countries are mostly focusing on their own interests rather than fighting terrorism, drug trafficking, or caring about human rights. Western governments violate human rights whenever it contravenes their interests, he pointed out. The expansion of bilateral and multilateral collaboration was stressed during the conference by each diplomat, who also said that strengthening cooperation between ASEAN nations and the Islamic Republic of Iran will support the long-term interests of the two sides.
