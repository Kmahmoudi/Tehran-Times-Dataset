TEHRAN - Tehran city councilor Nahid Khodakarami announced a ban on irrigating Tehran's green spaces from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., YJC reported on Friday. “On behalf of citizen’s request, Irrigation of green spaces in Tehran is banned from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and the violators would be fined,” Khodakarami wrote on her tweeter account in Persian on Friday. “Considering Tehran's water scarcity, keeping the grass green is not a priority but growing some plants compatible with the capital’s climatic characteristics makes more sense.” Earlier this month Tehran's governor general Mohammad Hossein Moqimi said that average precipitation level in Tehran has decreased by about 24 percent, and the capital’s groundwater level has faced a dramatic decline. He also noted that every household in Tehran consumes about 250 liters of water per day, which is twice above the international average.
