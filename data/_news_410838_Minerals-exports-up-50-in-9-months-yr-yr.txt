TEHRAN – The value of minerals Iran exported during the first nine months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, - December 20, 2016) has witnessed a 50 percent jump, IRNA quoted an industry official as saying. According to Iranian Deputy Industry Minister Jafar Sarqeini, the country has exported some $750 million worth of such products in the mentioned period.
“Added up by the mining industry’s exports, the total value of exports in this area reaches $5 billion which stands 16 percent higher than the figure for the same period last year,” Sarqeini said.
Based on a report by Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization (IMIDRO) in December 2016, Iran exported $4.4 billion of minerals and mining products during the first eight months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-November 20, 2016).
Mehdi Karbasian, the head of IMIDRO, announced in last July that 34 mining and mineral industries projects, costing $7.2 billion, would become operational in the country by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017).
Back in last May, Karbasian said that Iran had offered $40 billion in mining projects to foreign investors. EF/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
