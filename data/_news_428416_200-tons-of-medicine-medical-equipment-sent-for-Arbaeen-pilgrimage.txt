Arbaeen pilgrimage also known as Arbaeen trek, a distinctively Shia spiritual exercise, is an epic journey gathering Shias as well as Sunnis, even Christians and Zoroastrians, etc. from various nationalities altogether walking towards the holy shrine of Imam Hussein (AS) commemorating the 40th day of his martyrdom in the battle of Karbala, in 680 AD. “Some 14 trucks carrying 200 tons of medications and medical equipment are dispatched to Karbala,” Mar’ashi stated, YJC reported on Wednesday. The shipments include 400 types of essential medicine, and 80 other medical supplies and equipment, he said, adding that this year, over 2,000 health practitioners and 40 mobile medical clinics will offer medical treatments to the pilgrims. He went on to say that the IRCS team will be accompanied by over 90 medical specialists, including orthopedist, cardiologist, gynecologist, pediatrician, neurologist and psychiatrist. “Given that this year's pilgrims have been registered prior to the trek, all are covered by the health insurance coverage and can use medical services completely free of charge,” he further highlighted.
