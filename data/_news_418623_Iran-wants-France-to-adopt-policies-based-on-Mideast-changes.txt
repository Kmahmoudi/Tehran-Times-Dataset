TEHRAN - Kamal Kharrazi, the head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, said on Monday that realities in the Middle East have changed and France should adopt policies based on those changes.
 Talking to reporters, Kharrazi said France adopts position based on “wrong analyses”. “French President Emanuel Macron is making mistake. They [France] failed to fulfil their duties regarding the Syrian crisis and make mistakes to make up for their failure,” noted Kharrazi who was Iran’s foreign minister from 1997 to 2005. Macron has said that a new series of criteria and a new treaty should be negotiated with Iran to stop their ballistic activities in the region. “We want an Iran that is a less aggressive power and for its ballistic missile program to be curtailed. But Iran is a regional power and we speak to them,” Bloomberg quoted him as saying at a press conference in Gothenburg, Sweden. NA/PA
