TEHRAN - Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has said that the European Union is aware of Iran’s role in the Middle East region.
 “Iran’s regional role and its potential to establish peace and stability in the region have become more obvious to the European Union. They are well aware of the fact that Iran makes efforts to establish peace and stability in the region and attaches great importance to the issue without adopting double standards,” he told in an interview with ISNA published on Sunday. His comments came upon EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini’s visit to Iran and her meetings with President Hassan Rouhani and Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, on Saturday on the issue of the Syrian crisis. “It seems that the European Union pays more attention to the Middle East region and makes more efforts to play more active role through using its relations with the regional countries which is an important issue for Syria,” Qassemi remarked. He said that Iran is ready to cooperate with the countries that seek to fight terrorism seriously. NA/PA
