TEHRAN – The former chairman of U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff has criticized Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement, saying the U.S. walked away from allies by the decision. “We walked away from allies and withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Agreement. Yet strategically we should share complex problems. Fewer partners means fewer options,” General Martin Dempsey wrote on his twitter account on Tuesday. “We are now alone on a more dangerous path with fewer options. We’ll see,” said Dempsey, who had supported the nuclear deal, also called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
