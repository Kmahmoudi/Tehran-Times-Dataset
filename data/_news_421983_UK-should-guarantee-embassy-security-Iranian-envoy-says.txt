TEHRAN - Iranian Ambassador to London Hamid Baeidinejad has said that the British government should guarantee safety of Iran’s diplomatic premise in London.
 “The British government should guarantee that the group which had organized plan to attack the embassy of Iran poses no further threat,” he told IRNA in an interview published on Sunday. Four people, who were members of the Shirazi cult, climbed on to a balcony of the Iranian embassy in London on Friday and took down the Iranian flag. Baeidinejad said that the assailants were carrying knives and sticks and chanted slogans against Iranian officials and using bad language against Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman (the caliphs of Mecca) and Aisha, the wife of Prophet Mohammad (S). The ambassador said the British police should explain the reason behind releasing the assailants on bail. “Now we expect police forces to interpret future threats by the cult and its plans and objectives behind causing tension and seeking confrontation against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the diplomat remarked. He added, “The Shirazi cult has a Hussainiya in Britain that for its construction a high amount of money has been spent. They hold regular meetings in the Hussainiya. The British security forces should definitely be informed about their political and ideological plans.” Elsewhere, he said that top British officials have condemned the attack and have assured Iranians that the necessary security measures will be taken for the safety of the embassy. He also said, “In my opinion, this incident will not affect the relations between the two countries, because the British government and police forces’ stand has been clear in this respect, and we expect to be informed about details of the incident. At the current juncture, we have not found any evidence which proves that the incident was supported by the British government or police forces.” NA/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
