TEHRAN – Pointing to foreign plots hatched to undermine the Islamic Republic, Brigadier General Ramazan Sharif, the spokesman for the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, said on Sunday that the manifestation of “the enemies’ failures is before us to see.” “At the beginning of the [Islamic] Revolution and the imposed war, the enemy’s power was much greater,” Sharif said, underlining that all of the enemies’ plots against Iran have ended in failure, IRNA reported.   The “imposed war” refers to Iraq’s invasion of Iran in the 1980s. The general said the fact that the enemies have failed to destabilize Iran through their proxies such as al-Qaeda and ISIS is due to sacrifices made by Iranian youths.
