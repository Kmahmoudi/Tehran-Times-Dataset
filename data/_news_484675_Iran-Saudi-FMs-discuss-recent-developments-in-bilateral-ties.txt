TEHRAN- The top diplomats of Saudi Arabia and Iran underlined their commitment to mending ties, facilitating mutual collaboration, and reopening their diplomatic missions.  Hossein Amir Abdollahian of Iran and Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia spoke by phone on Friday night regarding the implementation of the deal that the two nations made in Beijing in March to reestablish diplomatic ties and reopen embassies. “The Islamic Republic is getting ready to formally reopen its embassy and consulates in Saudi Arabia,” Amir Abdollahian said. He said the discussions between top Saudi and Iranian officials will show how determined both nations are to work together and develop close ties. Amir Abdollahian asserted that Iran has completed the required preparations for the formal reopening of its embassy and consulate in Saudi Arabia, citing Tehran’s decision to appoint a new ambassador and send technical teams to the country to facilitate the restoration of diplomatic missions.  He said that the discussions and reciprocal trips between Saudi and Iranian officials demonstrate the two nations’ commitment to reestablishing cooperation and constructive relations. The Saudi foreign minister, for his part, reiterated that Riyadh sees bright prospects for relations with Tehran and will make every effort to deepen those relationships. “We have taken good steps in the past two months, and our adherence to the signed agreements shows our steely determination,” he noted.  He cited the positive developments of the previous two months and the two nations’ dedication to the rapprochement deal as evidence of their real intention to improve relations. Bin Farhan also expressed hope that by appointing ambassadors in Riyadh and Tehran, they would be able to enhance bilateral collaboration. Iran and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement on March 10 to reestablish diplomatic ties and reopen embassies and missions within two months after their seven-year closure, following several days of intense discussions held in China. The two regional powerhouses have underscored the need to respect one another’s national sovereignty and to abstain from meddling in one another’s internal affairs.
