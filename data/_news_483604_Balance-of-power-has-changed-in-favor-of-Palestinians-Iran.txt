TEHRAN - An Iranian Foreign Ministry official said on Thursday that efforts by Iranian legendary commander General Qassem Soleimani in uniting the resistance movement have shifted the balance of power in favor of Palestine to the detriment of Israel. By posting a photo of a recent meeting between Lebanese Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and top Palestinian resistance movement leaders in Beirut on his Twitter account, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani wrote, “Undoubtedly, these photos have different messages for the Zionist regime and for the Palestinian nation.” He said, “The balance of power has long shifted to the detriment of the fake Israeli regime and to the benefit of the Palestinian nation.” Kanaani noted, “The legacy of al-Quds martyr Lieutenant General Soleimani in bringing the resistance front together and filling their hands is visible more than ever.” On Sunday, the Hezbollah chief met in Beirut with a delegation of senior Hamas officials, including Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of the Gaza-based resistance group, Sheikh Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of the Hamas political bureau, and top officials Khalil al-Hayya and Osama Hamdan. Reportedly, they discussed “the readiness of the Axis of Resistance,” “the intensification of resistance in the West Bank and Gaza” and recent “events at al-Aqsa Mosque” in the Old City of al-Quds (Jerusalem).
