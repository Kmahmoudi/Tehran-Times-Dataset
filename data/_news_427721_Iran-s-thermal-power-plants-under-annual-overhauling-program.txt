TEHRAN – Some 448 units in 91 of Iran’s thermal power plants are going under a general overhauling program to get ready for the next year’s demand peak period, IRIB reported citing the Energy Ministry’s portal. The annual overhaul program starts every year in early September and will continue until late May in the next year, the report said. According to Bahman Mehran, head of Thermal Power Plants Holding Company (TPPH)’s planning, operation and marketing office, over 95,000 megawatts (MW) capacity of the country’s thermal power plants will go through overhaul during this year’s program. “Since the total capacity of the country’s thermal power plants stands at 57,600 MW, the mentioned figure indicates that some plants will go under more than one round of overhaul during the program,” the official said. Since the summer months constitute Iran’s peak demand periods, most of the power plant overhaul programs are scheduled to take place during autumn, winter and spring seasons.
