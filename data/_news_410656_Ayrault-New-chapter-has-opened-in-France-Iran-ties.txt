TEHRAN - French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a meeting with President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday that a “new chapter” in ties have been with Iran.
 Ayrault who made a two-day trip to Iran at the head of a 100-strong economic and political delegation left Tehran late on Wednesday.  “I am leaving Tehran at a time when a new chapter has been opened in relations between the two countries in various areas,” Ayrault noted.  Ayrault said that Paris is determined to expand relations with Tehran.  He also said that all signatories to the nuclear deal between Iran and the 5+1 group (the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany) should protect the agreement.  The chief diplomat also said France makes all efforts to remove impediments to banking relations.  According to the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran should slow down its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of all nuclear related economic and financial sanctions on the country.  The deal, struck in July 2015, took effect in January 2016. Despite a passage of a year some banks are still wary of transactions with Iran.  Ayrault also praised Iran’s “positive role” in the Middle East region.  For his part, Rouhani said Tehran welcomes expansion of Iran-France ties.  “Expansion of relations with France, as a friendly country in Europe, has always been important for Iran and visits of the two countries’ officials indicate that Tehran and Paris are determined to boost joint cooperation,” Rouhani said.  He also said that the nuclear agreement was an “important international event” and bears an important message to the world.  “The JCPOA bore the message that the complicated international issues can be settled through dialogue and within a win-win framework. So, all countries should make efforts in line with protecting it, because any harm to it would send dangerous message to the world that diplomacy is not able to solve the problems,” Rouhani explained.  The president added Iran has fully fulfilled its obligations under the JCPOA and called on the other parties to do so.  Commenting on fighting terrorism, he said France can play an important role in countering terrorism in the region.  Rouhani also said that the Syrian crisis should be settled through dialogue.
