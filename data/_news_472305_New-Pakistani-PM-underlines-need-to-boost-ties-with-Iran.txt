Pakistani President Arif Alvi also said in the meeting that Islamabad seeks to develop economic and trade relations with Iran. "Islamabad attaches importance to increasing the level of relations and cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran." President Alvi also pointed to the importance of border markets in expanding trade between the two countries, saying, "The minister of commerce of the government of Pakistan has travelled to these areas for the prosperity of these markets and we are ready to work with Iran to increase the value of trade between Iran and Pakistan.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
