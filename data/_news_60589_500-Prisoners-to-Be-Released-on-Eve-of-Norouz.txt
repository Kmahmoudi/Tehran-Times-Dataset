The SPO's Director General, Mortazavi, said that a considerable number of prisoners are in prison due to financial problems. He added that these prisoners are divided into two groups. "Those in the first group are the ones who have unintentionally committed some offenses. The other group comprises those whose checks have bounced, or who have gone bankrupt due to economic fluctuations." Mortazavi said that there are about 150 organs and institutions supporting the prisoners and their families. "These institutions have collected the people's financial contributions, and they will pay for the financial obligations of these prisoners and bring about their release from prison.
