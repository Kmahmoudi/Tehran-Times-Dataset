TEHRAN – Tehran, embracing plenty of historical sites, museums and art galleries, is expected to draw more visitors during Norouz celebration, the Iranian New Year starting March 21. Up to 40% discounts for its hotels, less traffic and clear spring weather are amongst the compelling reasons behind. Initiated by the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization, the discount program pursues boost in arrivals during Norouz whilst the city grows quiet, the air becomes clean and traffic virtually becomes non-existent. “Tehran hotels will offer up to 40% discounts during Norouz [March 21 - April 2],” said Mohammad Ali Farrokhmehr who heads the Association of Tehran Hotels and Hotel Apartments. “Norouz is the best time to sightseeing in Tehran as it becomes much less crowded.” According to the CHTHO, open-top double-decker buses would be added to Tehran transport fleet, offering unlimited hop-on, hop-off tours across the capital. Every year, a large number of residents in Tehran set off journeys to benefit from a two-week-long school holiday.   PHOTO: A view of Tehran with snow-clad Alborz mountain range in the foreground AFM/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
