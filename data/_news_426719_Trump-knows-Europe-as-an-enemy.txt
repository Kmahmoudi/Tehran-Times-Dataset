TEHRAN - President Donald Trump of the United States has kept the White House pressures on the European Union. This has led to dissatisfaction of U.S. European partners from Washington.Many analysts of the international affairs have recently had a special focus on U.S.-EU relations! Some signals and speeches by the President of the United States which are addressed to the European authorities indicate the full opposition of the White House to the European Union.  Over the past few weeks, there had been news about the specific talks between the President of the United States and some of the European Union’s member states. Trump called on French President “Emmanuel Macron” to leave the European Union and thus build wider bilateral relations with the United States! Undoubtedly, there will soon be more economic disputes between America and Europe. In other words, the Trade war between these two will become more intense in near future. Furthermore, countries like China and Canada will also enter this confrontation with the United States. At their most recent meeting, European officials argued that they have the right to respond to Trump's actions.  However, some European authorities, including Theresa May, believed that amid the existing disagreements raised between Brussels and Washington, EU leaders should attempt to negotiate and hold talks with Trump! Obviously, the British Prime Minister's views can’t be accepted by other European players, and that’s because now Britain is on the brink of leaving the European Union, and this country has now become a symbol of inconsistency in this block. Trump's negative attitude towards the European Union does not end there. The EU is one of the biggest foes of the U.S., President Donald Trump said just ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Jeff Glor in Scotland, released on Sunday, Trump was asked to identify his “biggest foe globally right now.” “Well, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn’t think of the European Union, but they’re a foe,” Trump said. He also named Russia and China as foes, but added “that doesn’t mean they are bad. It doesn’t mean anything. It means that they are competitive.” “I respect the leaders of those countries. But, in a trade sense, they’ve really taken advantage of us and many of those countries are in NATO and they weren’t paying their bills,” he said.European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted in response: “America and the EU are best friends. Whoever says we are foes is spreading fake news.” Regarding this newly raised dispute, there are some points that can’t be easily ignoredthe European officials haven’t yet understood the extent of Trump’s hostility to the existence of the United European! This is while the trade war between Trump and the European Union has entered a new phase since the beginning of 2018.  Some American economic analysts believe that based on his protectionist policies, Trump will impose new and wider tariffs on the EU, China, Canada and Mexico in the future. European officials are now faced with a president who sees "economic protectionism" as a major policy in the field of commerce, and in the future he will try to pursue this policy even more seriously.
