TEHRAN — The World Health Organization (WHO) director general has appreciated Iran’s efforts in primary healthcare and healthcare reform plan, recognizing Iran as a good example of carrying out proper primary healthcare projects, ISNA reported. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the remarks in his meeting with Iranian Health Minister, Hassan Qazizadeh Hashemi on the sidelines of The Global Conference on Primary Health Care.   The conference was held on October 25-26 in Astana, Kazakhstan, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Alma-Ata Declaration.  Contagious diseases in the region and collaboration of Iran with its neighboring countries to fight them were the key topics discussed in the meeting.  Over the meeting, Ghebreyesus said that necessary arrangements will be made to better organize the next regional Health Ministerial Meeting in Tehran, thanking Iran for its significant achievements so far.   He noted that local and regional problems usually prevent people from maintaining their health especially in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Syria.  Qazizadeh Hashemi, for his part, invited Ghebreyesus to travel to Iran to visit the country’s health care system. On the sidelines of the event, Iranian Health Minister also visited his Russian, Kazakh and Indonesian counterparts and signed agreements in related fields.  The Global Conference on Primary Health Care “From Alma-Ata toward Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals,” was organized by the Government of Kazakhstan, the World Health Organization and UNICEF. The Declaration of Alma-Ata was adopted at the International Conference on Primary Health Care (PHC), Almaty (formerly known as Alma-Ata), Kazakhstan (formerly Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic), September 6 to 12, 1978. It expressed the need for urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the health of all people. According to the World Health Organization at its heart, primary health care is about caring for people, rather than simply treating specific diseases or conditions. Primary health care is usually the first point of contact people have with the health care system. It provides comprehensive, accessible, community-based care that meets the health needs of individuals throughout their life. SJ/MQ/MG
