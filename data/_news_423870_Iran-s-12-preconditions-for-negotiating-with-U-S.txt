TEHRAN - Reaffirming the withdrawal of Trump's government from the nuclear deal with Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently put forward conditions for concluding a "new agreement" with Iran at the Heritage Foundation.  Apart from the widespread criticism that has been raised in Iran and the international system (and even among the United States’ allies) against the Pompeo’s remarks, "12 prerequisites" can be given to the United States and the Trump’s government merely for letting them negotiate with Iranian authorities. It is to be noted here that the following prerequisites shouldn’t be taken as Iran’s terms and conditions for reaching an "agreement with the United States", but those are merely preconditions for setting up a negotiating table with the United States and the Trump government: 1. Full nuclear disarmament of the United States, and the destruction of its nuclear weapons, with the presence of international supervisors. 2. Stopping the construction of intercontinental ballistic missiles by the United States, and the destruction of the available missile under the supervision of arm control experts. 3- Full recognition of 20% industrial Uranium enrichment in Iran 4. Agreeing with the Islamic Republic of Iran in the international circles for the full nuclear disarmament of the Zionist regime and the regime’s join to the NPT 5. U.S. thorough withdrawal from the Persian Gulf and the closure of U.S. military bases in the region. 6. The closure of all U.S. military bases in the neighboring countries of Iran, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from West Asia, Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent Note: The U.S. diplomatic presence in neighboring countries of Iran is subject to the lack of interference in the internal affairs of Iran. 7. The release of all blocked property and confiscated property of Iran in the United States, with full payout of their maintenance since 1977 8. Official apologizing the Iranian people for the coup of August 19, 1953, and paying for the 25-year presence of the Pahlavi regime since then (by forming a joint committee between Iran and the United States) 9. Admitting full responsibility for supporting Saddam Hussein during the imposed war on Iran, apologizing the Iranian people and calculating and paying for the losses incurred by the imposed war on the Islamic Republic of Iran. 10. Accepting full legal responsibility for the shot down of Iran’s civilian passenger flight from Tehran to Dubai, number 655, by an SM-2MR surface-to-air missile fired from USS Vincennes, a guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy (which took place on July 3, 1988), providing compensation to its survivors, and apologizing the Iranian nation (in the form of a Declaration read by the President and U.S. Secretary of State) 11. Official recognition of the responsibility for the creation of ISIS and al-Qaeda in West Asia and the Indian subcontinent, and providing practical guarantees to Iran and other independent states of the region to compensate for the losses caused by the creation of terrorist and Takfiri groups. 12. Closing the media, satellite, and political databases of counter- Islamic Revolution currents in the United States and stop funding them. In case "all" these preconditions were realized, the United States can make its formal request to negotiate with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and, if approved by the diplomatic and military apparatus of our country, begin to talk with the Iranian representatives.
