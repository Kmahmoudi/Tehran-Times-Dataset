TEHRAN – Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Friday that the U.S. exit from the 2015 nuclear deal could trigger dangerous instability. "We can't sort things out with North Korea. Do we want another problem on the same scale?" Putin asked at a business forum, Fox News reported. The Russian leader said the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 agreement came even as the international nuclear watchdog confirmed that Tehran was fulfilling its obligations. “What should it be punished for, then?” Putin asked.
