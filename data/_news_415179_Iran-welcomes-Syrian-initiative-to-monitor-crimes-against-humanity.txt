TEHRAN – A foreign policy adviser to the Iranian Parliament speaker has said that Iran welcomes the initiative by a number of Syrian lawmakers to launch a center in two towns of al-Foua and Kafriya to monitor crimes against humanity. “Iran is steadfast in fighting terrorism and finding a political solution to the Syrian issue,” Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a meeting on Sunday with Hussein Raqib al-Hussein, head of Syria-Iran parliamentary friendship group. The two Syrian towns, 10 km to the northern Idlib, have been under siege since 2015 by terrorist groups.
