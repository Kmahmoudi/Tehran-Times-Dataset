TEHRAN – A team of Iranian and Italian experts has been tasked to construct custom-made roofing covers for some certain glorious ruins at Pasargadae, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in southern Iran. The scheme will be implemented during fall in close collaboration with the Rome-based International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, Hamid Fadai, director of the world heritage site announced in a press release on Monday.
Situated in about 50km north of Persepolis, Pasargadae was the capital of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great who had issued its construction in about 546 BC.
The site which hosts the tomb of Cyrus, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004 during the World Heritage Committee’s 28th session in Suzhou, China.
