TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday congratulated the Iraqi people and government for their bravery in succeeding to fully liberate the city of Mosul from the hands of Daesh.
 “Congratulations to brave people & Government of Iraq upon liberation of Mosul. When Iraqis join hands, no limits to what they can achieve,” Zarif tweeted. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, dressed in a military uniform, visited Mosul on Sunday to congratulate armed forces for wresting the city from Daesh, also called ISIS or ISIL.  The victory marked the formal end of a fierce campaign that lasted nearly nine months and left much of Iraq’s second-largest city in ruins. Top Iranian military officials, including Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri, also sent congratulations to Iraqi military and political officials on victory over Daesh. In his message to Erfan al-Hiyali, the Iraqi defense minister, Dehqan said that eradication of terrorism is only possible through adoption of “real” and “collective” determination by the governments and formation of a “united front” against terrorism. In a message to the Iraqi prime minister, Major General Bagheri expressed hope that expansion of ties between the Iranian and Iraqi armed forces would foil plots and help establish stability and security in the region.  Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani also congratulated Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani and Abadi on liberation of Mosul in separate messages. The top security official added Iran wishes Iraq would present “a successful model in resisting against plots and proxy wars”.
