TEHRAN - Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said on Friday that 30 bombing plots were foiled in Iran during the past calendar year and only five of them were publicized.
 The last Iranian year ended on March 20 Alavi said there is no worry about “terror” or “bombing” in Iran thanks to the vigilance of the security forces. Iran’s Intelligence Ministry issued a statement in June last year announcing it had foiled one of the “biggest terrorist plots of Takfiri-Wahhabi groups” in Tehran and some other cities. “Under the criminal plot of the anti-Islamic Takfiri terrorist group, a series of bombings in several spots of the country had been planned for the coming events in Tehran and some other cities and the devil actions of the Takfiri terrorists were foiled… and the terrorists were arrested and a large amount of explosives were seized,” the statement said. Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani also confirmed in June that some suicide attacks had been foiled in Tehran during the holy month of Ramadan. The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps also announced in June that its forces had killed five members of the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan (PJAK) in the northwestern border city of Sardasht. In another clash in the southern city of Khash on June 13, police forces killed five members of a terrorist group which is an offshoot of Jaish ul-Adl. NA/PA
