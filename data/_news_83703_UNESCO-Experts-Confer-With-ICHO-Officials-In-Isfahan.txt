The Head of ICHO research institute, Rasoul Vatandoust pointed out that UNESCO is, in general, confronted with problems with respect to the historical structures in Isfahan and, in particular, with the registration of Imam Square as a global historical monument. According to him questions have been posed by UNESCO experts concerning the structure of the monuments and the municipal's programs on the protection of the city's historical texture. Besides, once they are registered among the world historical monuments, global regulations should be applied for their protection, IRNA reported. He added that UNESCO is quite sensitive to the historical monuments and structures in Isfahan. He announced that 17 historical monuments in Iran have been proposed for registration as global historical edifice. He said that once the registration process of Takht-e Soleyman as historical monument is realized, the preliminary measures for the registration of Imam Square in Isfahan is likely to be completed as well. A UNESCO expert attending the meeting referred to the measures taken to protect central Isfahan as improper and expressed concern over the future structures that might rise higher than Isfahan's Imam Mosque to overshadow this historical monument. He added, "Building structures at historical cities, such as Isfahan, should be located on the outskirts and progress toward the central part of the city rather than vice versa." Another UNESCO expert said that Isfahan is one of the most lively historical cities worldwide and efforts toward collecting information and documents on Iran's historical monuments will facilitate the process of their registration. He added, "Isfahan's development should not be restricted to its central area and that such overall development should be materialized in accordance with ICHO goals." The issues of interest at the current meeting are compliant with the city's skyline and urban regulations as well as the construction procedure followed in Isfahan rather than that of mere architecture, also a training workshop on the trend of registration of global monuments opened on the sidelines of the meeting, which is attended by 20 senior ICHO experts. The two-day workshop is aimed at providing training on the registration process for world historical monuments.
