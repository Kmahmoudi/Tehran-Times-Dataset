TEHRAN – Iranian director and producer Mehrdad Oskui have cancelled the Iranian premiere of “Starless Dreams”, his latest documentary set in an Iranian rehabilitation center for girls, to conceal the identity of the juvenile offenders appearing in the film. The decision was made to avoid any trouble that may arise for the juveniles after the screening of the documentary, Oskui told the Persian service of ILNA on Wednesday.  The documentary shows young women in an Iranian juvenile detention center reflecting on the crimes they have committed and the harsh circumstances that have shaped their lives. “Starless Dreams” was scheduled to go on screen at the Art and Experience Cinema, movie theaters that are dedicated to screening art films and other movies aimed typically at a limited audience. The documentary earned a special mention at the 4th Kino w Trampkach Film Festival for Children and Youth, which was held in Warsaw, Poland earlier this week. “Starless Dreams” also won the top award of the 19th Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, which was held in Durham, North Carolina.
