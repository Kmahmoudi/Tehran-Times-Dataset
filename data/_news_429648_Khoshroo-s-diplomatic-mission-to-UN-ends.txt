TEHRAN - Gholamali Khoshroo’s diplomatic mission to the United Nations formally came to an end on Friday as the Iranian parliament has adopted a legislation banning employment of retirees.
 Khoshroo was Iran’s top ambassador to the United Nations, the largest international body in the world.   Some sources say that Hamid Baeidinejad, Iran’s ambassador to London, will replace Khoshroo.    In a goodbye ceremony with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Khoshroo said the international community should stand against the U.S. unilateral actions. “It is unprecedented in the history of the United Nations that a permanent member of the Security Council punish other members for being committed to the council’s resolutions. The international community should stand against such unilateral and illegal actions,” Khoshroo pointed out. In May, President Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the historic 2015 nuclear agreement, which was endorsed by the UN Security Council resolution 2231, and reintroduced sanctions on Iran.  The first batch of sanctions were enacted in August. The second wave of sanctions, which targets Iran’s oil exports and central bank, were reimposed on November 4. Trump has threatened that any foreign company that continues to do business with Iran also faces U.S. sanctions.
