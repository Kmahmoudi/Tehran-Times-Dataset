TEHRAN – In a high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Tehran on Wednesday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei noted that the experience of “good cooperation” between Tehran and Moscow in Syria showed that it is possible to achieve “common goals”. “The result of this cooperation showed that Tehran and Moscow can realize common goals in difficult situations,” Ayatollah Khamenei remarked. The Leader called for cooperation to counter sanctions against Iran and Russia by the United States, suggesting that the two countries can boycott U.S.-made goods through certain approaches including eliminating dollar and replacing it with national currencies in bilateral or multilateral economic transactions. The “joint resistance” by Iran and Russia against “takfiri terrorists” in Syria, which are supported by some foreign countries, proved “meaningful” and bore “important results”, the Leader pointed out. He also said the coalition between Iran and Russia against terrorists helped make Russia emerge as an “influential force in Western Asia”. The Leader also said, “We should use the recent years’ useful experiences at (both) regional issues and bilateral levels to strengthen and develop ties.” Ayatollah Khamenei also said the potential for economic cooperation between Tehran and Moscow is far higher than the current level, suggesting that Iran and Russia can extend their economic ties by linking Chabahar port in the Persian Gulf to the port city of St Petersburg. The Leader also called for cooperation to counter sanctions against the two countries by the United States, suggesting that the two countries can boycott U.S.-made goods through certain approaches including eliminating dollar and replacing it with national currencies in bilateral or multilateral economic transactions. In this way the sanctions will become “ineffective” and Washington will even be “isolated”, the Leader noted.

“It is due to this reason that one can talk to Russia as a great power about important works, which entail determination and efforts, and establish logical cooperation,” Ayatollah Khamenei said.  The Leader also welcomed proposal by Putin for multilateral regional cooperation. Ayatollah Khamenei called Putin a “man of action” with “strong personality”. Putin also said Russia considers Iran as a “strategic partner” and “great neighbor” and that Moscow will use every opportunity to strengthen inclusive ties with Tehran. Putin also praised cooperation between Russia and Iran in Syria, saying it has produced good results. He also said the two countries should go ahead with their struggle against terrorism in Syria and simultaneously help facilitate a political process for the resolution of the conflict between the Syrian government and armed opposition groups. Putin also defended the international nuclear deal between Iran and P5+1 countries, noting his country is opposed to any changes to the terms of the multilateral nuclear agreement through a unilateral approach. “We consider it a violation international law and regulations,” he asserted in open reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for changing the terms of the nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In this talks with the Leader, Putin also said linking Iran’s other issues including its defense program with the nuclear deal is a “wrong approach”.
