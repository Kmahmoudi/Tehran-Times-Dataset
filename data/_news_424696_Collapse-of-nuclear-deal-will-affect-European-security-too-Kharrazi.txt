TEHRAN - The collapse of the international nuclear agreement will have very dangerous consequences for security in the Middle East, head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations Kamal Kharrazi has warned, noting that it will affect security in Europe as well.
 Since Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the multilateral nuclear agreement Iran has threatened it will leave the agreement if Europe fails to give assurances to Iran of the benefits of the agreement. In an interview with EFE news agency, Kharrazi said Europe should find ways to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal “otherwise there would be no reason for Iran to remain in the agreement”. Kharrazi, who was Iran’s foreign minister from 1997 to 2005, also said Iran attaches great importance to European governments’ support for the companies that seek to invest in Iran. After a meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi on Wednesday, Kharrazi called on European countries to show unity in the face of U.S. pressure and save the nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.   On May 8, President Donald Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the UN-endorsed nuclear agreement and plans to reimpose sanctions on Iran.
