TEHRAN – The secretary general of Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement slammed the Saudi regime for its increased attacks on the Arabian Peninsula country, saying Riyadh is trying to toady to new US President Donald Trump. The secretary general of Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement slammed the Saudi regime for its increased attacks on the Arabian Peninsula country, saying Riyadh is trying to toady to new US President Donald Trump. “With Trump coming to power in the US, a new stage has started in the international arena and priorities have changed,” Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi said. Today, the US mercenaries, including the Al Saud regime, are competing with each other to get Washington’s approval, the Ansarullah leader said. He added that the objective behind Riyadh’s increased attacks on Yemen is to appease Donald Trump. Yemen’s defenseless people have been under massive attacks by a coalition led by the Saudi regime for nearly two years but Riyadh has reached none of its objectives in Yemen so far. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and some of its Arab allies have been launching airstrikes against the Houthi Ansarullah movement in an attempt to restore power to the fugitive former President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. Some 11,000 Yemenis, including women and children, have lost their lives in the deadly military campaign.
