TEHRAN - Biden still does not feel good about Sanders' presence in the U.S. presidential election race! The former vice president of the United States is well aware that Sanders is the strongest rival to him. He is not afraid of anyone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, because polls show Biden can easily defeat other Democratic rivals in the election.  The fact is that Biden is entering a major political gamut! About three months ago, when Biden had indirectly announced his entry to the U.S. presidential election, many polls showed his absolute victory. However, Bernie Sanders has managed to win many Democrats in their favor for the last three months. Recent polls in the United States show that Biden's sense of concern over Sanders's presence in the Democratic primaries is completely logical! As Usatoday reported, Sen. Bernie Sanders finished ahead of Joe Biden in the first major national poll of the year that did not find the former vice president leading the pack of potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. When asked whom they would support from a list of 20 candidates – including "someone else" – 29% named Sanders, and 24% named Biden in an Emerson College poll released Monday. They were trailed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was the pick of 9% of likely Democratic primary voters. California Sen. Kamala Harris and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke each came in at 8%, and 7% picked Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro got 3%, as did entrepreneur Andrew Yang. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker got 2%, and the rest of the field got 1% or less. The fact is that Joe Biden has not gotten two more choices now! First, he officially announced his presence in the presidential elections of 2020. In this case, Biden's defeat at Sanders would mean his political death in the Democratic Party. New polls show Biden has no easy way to beat Sanders. Biden is well aware that if Sanders in Iowa (where the first Democratic party elections are held) and New Hampshire (the second state in which Democratic elections are held) will win, Sanders's ultimate victory in The Democratic Party is rising. In this case, Biden will become a defeated and loser in the Democratic Party. The second option is to abandon Biden's participation in the 2020 presidential election. Although this choice will reduce Biden's political credibility with Democrat supporters, he will not be able to face his political death! Biden can then maintain his position with the Democrat leaders. Ultimately, Biden has been left with a hard time! He is confronted with polls that today reflect the rise of Barney Sanders and an increase in his votes with Democratic voters. Biden knows that his defeat to Bernie Sanders is a nightmare, a nightmare that Biden sees in polls.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
