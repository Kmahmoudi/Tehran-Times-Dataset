TEHRAN- "Ukraine’s president, prime minister, and minister of energy back development of bonds with Iran," the portal of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA) quoted the eastern European country’s Deputy Minister of Energy and the Coal Industry Galina Karp as saying on Friday. In a meeting with ICCIMA Head Gholam-Hossein Shafeie, who took a trip to Kiev leading a high-raking delegation, Karp said that regarding the available wide range of fields for boosting common cooperation, Ukrainian economic enterprises are inclined to collaborate with Iranians on establishing gas and oil pipelines or on renovating, maintenance and establishment of new power plants. Shafeie, for his part, announced that Tehran has been expanding cooperation with Kiev and considering Ukraine as a gateway to Europe; adding that “expanding economic ties with Ukraine would guarantee Iran’s access to Europe.” Despite the 30-percent growth experienced in bilateral trade between the two countries last year, the figure can be improved dramatically considering the available potentials and capacities for the two sides.  HJ/MA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
