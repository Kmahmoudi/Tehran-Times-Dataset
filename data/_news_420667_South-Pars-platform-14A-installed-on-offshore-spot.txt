TEHRAN-Platform 14A of Iran’s South Pars gas field (in the Persian Gulf), which had been loaded at Bandar Abbas yard on January 2, was installed on its designated offshore spot on Wednesday, Shana news agency reported. The 2,500-ton structure is the main platform of South Pars phase 14 of development, according to Hamidreza Masoudi, the operator of phases 14. Phase 14 is expected to produce 56.6 million cubic meters of sour gas and 75,000 billion barrels of gas condensate per day, one million tons of liquefied gas and one million tons of ethane per year, and 400 tons a day of sulfur. South Pars, which Iran shared with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate. The field is divided into 24 standard phases of development in the first stage. Most of the phases are fully operational at the moment. For the moment, production of gas from the giant gas field stands at 555 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d), according to Mohammad Meshkinfam, the managing director of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), which is in charge of developing South Pars.
