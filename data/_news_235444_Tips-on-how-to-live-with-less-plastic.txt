We live in a world that is literally molded in plastic, from beverage and food containers to toys, cell phones, computers, bags and a range of household items. It is everywhere and unfortunately seems to be going nowhere. Not only is plastic non-biodegradable, it is also one of the most toxic pollutants in the world and causes damage to the environment, right from its production to its disposal. In addition, plastics are manufactured using chemicals like Bisphenol-A and Phthalates that can be dangerous to our health.
