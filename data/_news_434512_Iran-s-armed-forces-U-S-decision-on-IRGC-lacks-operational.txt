TEHRAN – Iran’s armed forces said in a statement on Tuesday that it will spare no efforts to fight against the terrorist CENTCOM in West Asia. The armed forces condemned the United States’ designation of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization and warned of the consequences of the move, Tasnim reported. The move “was a desperate, retaliatory attempt aimed to cover [U.S.] failures in the region… It has no operational value and is doomed to failure,” the statement added. In response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s move to blacklist the Guards, Iran retaliated by designating CENTCOM in West Asia and all its affiliates as a terrorist organization in turn.
