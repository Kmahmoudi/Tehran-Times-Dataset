TEHRAN - It’s been a few days since the launch of large-scale and aggressive operation of the Saudi-led coalition in the strategic port of al-Hudaydah.  The Saudi-led coalition has suffered a miscalculation in its estimates of the security and military conditions governing Yemen's development. The Saudis and their allies, in the form of an all-out war against the defenseless and innocent people of Yemen, thought they would be able to take over the strategic port of al-Hudaydah in a short time. The Saudis-led coalition, with the aim of covering up their past defeats in the battle with the Yemeni army and popular committees, headed by the forces of Ansarullah, entered the al-Hudaydah campaign. When Saudi Arabia and its allies failed to overcome Yemeni forces over the course of more than three years during aerial and terrestrial battles, they decided to enter the sea and set targets through the waterways in Yemen. Al-Hudaydah port was the best option for the attacks of the Saudis. Although Saudi-led coalition have organized numerous attacks over the past days on Yemeni forces and infrastructure, the fact is that they have failed to dominate al-Hudaydad as well as other Yemeni regions and strategic cities. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not achieved much other than domination of the province of Aden in Yemen. Far from the Yemeni capital, Aden is a province that is virtually impossible to access Yemen's critical through it. Saudi-les coalition’s large-scale attacks have targeted Yemen's al-Hudaydah while human rights organizations and institutions in the region and world, warn about the serious consequences of the attacks. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has also announced that the lives of some 350,000 Yemeni children are at stake. The Red Cross said that the attacks would end up with a lot of human tragedies. Robert Mardini, the regional director for the Near and Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in a conversation with Reuters that what’s called a “great battle” for attacking al-Hudaydah could turn into a humanitarian catastrophe in the region, because it’s one of the areas which has very high population density. Head of Yemen's Supreme Revolutionary Committee, Mohammad Ali al-Houthi said Yemenis emphasize the defense of al-Hudaydah's province against the aggression of the Saudi-led coalition. Saudi Arabia is responsible for any attack or threat against the al-Hudaydah port. The Yemeni army and popular forces targeted Saudi Arabia's Aramco Oil Company in the Southern province of Jizan. While Yemeni ballistic missiles are heading one after the other over strategic positions of the Saudis at border crossings. Russian officials have also explicitly stated that such an attack would put the peace process in Yemen at serious risk and will complicate the crisis even further. The strategic significance of al-Hudaydah, which the Saudis covet in the eyes of greed, is that al-Hudaydah is very close to the capital of Yemen, Sana'a. The difference between al-Hudaydah and Aden for the Saudis is that Aden is far from other cities and provinces of Yemen. What adds to the strategic importance of al-Hudaydah province is the presence of al-Hudaydah’s strategic port. The Saudis themselves are well aware that full control of this strategic port, which overlooks other coastal provinces in northern Yemen, can pave the way for them to reach the northern coastal provinces. On the other hand, domination of the harbor of al-Hudaydah by the Saudis allows them the domination of all Yemen's waterways. Al-Hudaydah port is the first waterway to the Yemeni islands at the strategic depth of the country. The same strategic significance has also led the Saudis to refuse to halt their aggressive operations. The most important Yemeni islands that the Saudis seek to reach through the port of al-Hudaydah are Greater Hanish (Hanish Al Kubra), Hanish al-Soghra, and Jebel-Sagar. Meanwhile, the United States also plays a major role in the widespread assaults of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Americans are now, in addition to arming Saudi offensive forces, Emirati and their allies, have been directly involved in the battle of Al-Hudaydah.  The reason behind Washington’s interference in the war is that the Saudi and Emirati forces are not able to dominate the port's strategic al-Hudaydah. The Saudi mercenaries, such as the Sudanese, Moroccans, and part of the Egyptian forces, not only were not able to approach the port of al-Hudaydah, but also suffered a lot of damages. The American strategy is to take away the Red Sea from Muslims so that the sea will no longer be available to the Islamic countries. In a nutshell, taking over Al-Hudaydah is a dead dream for Riyadh.
