TEHRAN- Iran’s Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi announced that the agreement on purchasing Airbus planes will be concluded within the next three or four weeks, Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday. “To put the deal into action, Airbus is required to obtain some permits from the American authorities, negotiations of which are primarily conducted,” Akhoundi said. In case talks with the giant airplane manufacturer bear fruit, the first airplanes will enter Iran in the Iranian calendar month of Mehr (September 22-October 19), he said. The Iranian flag carrier, Iran Air, agreed in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion from Airbus when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani skirted the German capital in a tour of Europe. Iran is also looking to purchase smaller planes from Canada’s Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer, as Press TV reported in January. Iranian airliners have been long putting on a brave face under sanctions, keeping their aging fleets operational mainly through falling back on black markets. However, with the nuclear pact concluded between Iran and major powers, Iranian airliners now hope to fly safer, cutting-edge planes.
