The Iranian minister underlined Iran’s commitment to the signed preferential trade agreement (PTA) with Turkey and called for expansion of the types of goods traded via PTA to reach the set 30-billion-dollar annual bilateral trade in future. Rahmani also welcomed construction of industrial parks in Iran with cooperation of Turkish companies, naming it a good opportunity for attraction of investments and transferring knowledge into Iran on the way to boost Iran’s non-oil exports and job creation. Referring to the high available capacity of free and special zones at Iran-Turkey border, the Iranian official recommended formation of a working group to facilitate mutual trade. Accordingly, the committee to ease Iran-Turkey trade would remove customs barriers and ease mutual commerce between the two sides.
