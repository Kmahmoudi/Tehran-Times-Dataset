TEHRAN – The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) welcomes a new contribution of €1 million (approximately US$1.2 million) from the Federal Republic of Germany that will be used to provide food assistance to 30,000 of the most vulnerable Afghan and Iraqi refugees living in settlements in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This contribution demonstrates Germany’s continued support for WFP’s efforts following Germany’s contribution of €1 million earlier this year. The new contribution will enable WFP to meet the basic food and nutrition needs of refugees living in 20 settlements across 13 provinces in Iran through the first quarter of 2018.  “Germany’s timely contribution helps us to address the most basic needs of refugee families who are almost totally reliant on WFP assistance for their daily food needs, particularly women and children,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Iran Negar Gerami. “Germany continues to be one of WFP’s top five donors in Iran and we are immensely grateful for their steadfast commitment since 2014.”   WFP will use the funds to provide both cash and food assistance to address the most pressing needs of refugee families. Cash empowers refugee women and men to buy food of their own choice and diversify their dietary intake. The local economy receives a boost as well, particularly at markets around settlements.  “While striving to alleviate the causes of forced migration, Germany is providing aid on the ground to migrants who need protection, adequate care and opportunities,” said Ambassador of Germany to Iran Michael Klor-Berchtold. “By supporting WFP, Germany helps to alleviate the suffering of those most affected. Through our continued support, we share the responsibility to solve and prevent the large and protracted refugee situation the country has been facing for more than three decades.”  Iran hosts the world’s fourth largest refugee population, with nearly 980,000 registered Afghan and Iraqi refugees residing in the country.
