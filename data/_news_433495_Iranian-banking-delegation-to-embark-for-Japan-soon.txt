TEHRAN- An Iranian banking delegation will soon leave Tehran for Tokyo as accorded in a meeting between the Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Abdolnaser Hemmati and Japan’s Ambassador to Tehran Mitsugu Saito, the portal of CBI reported on Wednesday. The visit seeks to accelerate finalization of clearing Japan’s oil payments to Iran and trade of goods between the two sides, the report said. Underlining that Japanese companies preserved their businesses with Iran over the past months despite the U.S. sanctions against Tehran, the Japanese ambassador said that his country will continue economic relations with Iran according to its own interests. Cementing economic ties between the two countries is Japan’s first priority regarding its relations with Iran, Mitsugu Saito said two weeks ago.
