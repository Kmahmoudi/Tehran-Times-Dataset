TEHRAN – Having got back from his Eurasian tour late on Friday, President Rouhani said time is ripe for Iran to review its ties with friendly countries in the past-sanctions era.  “Our situation in the post-sanctions era is such that we can establish close economic relations with our friendly countries,” he said upon arrival in Tehran. 
However, for this to happen the groundwork needs to be laid, he added, stressing good consultation on banking issues with the three countries of Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan.
