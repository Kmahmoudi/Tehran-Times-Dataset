TEHRAN – Iran will play host to two international conferences on health tourism in 2019, a senior official with the Ministry of Health said on Tuesday. “The 5th Conference on Health Tourism in Islamic Countries” and “the 2nd Conference and Exhibition of Health Tourism for Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) countries” will be held in the country, said Mohammad Jahangiri who presides over the International Healthcare Association, Mehr reported. Started in 2010, the northeastern city of Mashhad hosted the four previous editions of the Conference on Health Tourism in Islamic Countries. The conference is mainly aimed at addressing the challenges, upper-level strategies and development plans for prioritizing health tourism among the Islamic countries. The second edition of health tourism conference by ECO countries will be held in the northwestern city of Ardebil, after a gap of five years, the report added. Back in May, the official announced that Iran has capacity to annually earn $7 billion in medical and health tourism, noting “the sector now brings in only one-seventh or even lesser of the sum.” Lack of sufficient direct flights to some countries, somewhat booked-up hotels in high seasons are amongst other issues that should be addressed, the official explained. Tens of hospitals have so far been granted special licenses and are running international patient departments across the country. Wallet-friendly and quality treatment services are what Iran is globally famous for when it comes to medical travels.
