TEHRAN – Hamas co-founder Mahmoud al-Zahar has said that Iran is the only country that supports the Lebanese resistance movement against Israel, but noted that Iran’s support alone is not enough to annihilate Israel.

 “I am talking of the entire Islamic world which makes one third of the world. What support did Muslims offer for Palestine?” he asked in an interview with Al-Mayadeen on Wednesday. Elsewhere, he said that Hamas was denied using the Rafah border crossing to travel to Iran to attend a conference on Palestine.
