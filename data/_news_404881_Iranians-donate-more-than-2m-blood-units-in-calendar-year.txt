TEHRAN — Over two million blood units were collected in Iran last calendar year (March 2015-March 2016), the Blood Transfusion Organization director said on Tuesday. “We have the highest index of blood donation among developing countries,” IRNA news agency quoted Ali-Akbar Pourfatollah as saying. “We have 27 blood units per 1,000 population which is good,” he said, adding “the number is 30 to 50 in developed countries.” “The rate of blood donation among women is low in Iran and in other developing countries.” Developed countries are trying to change this attitude, Pourfatollah pointed, “We assure women that donating blood would not cause any problem for them.” MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
