TEHRAN- Iran's foreign minister says the Islamic Republic is willing to work with the UN nuclear watchdog to resolve the remaining doubts about its nuclear activity as long as the Agency's approach to the nation is strictly technical.
 The comments were made by Hossein Amir Abdollahian in a special interview with the al-Monitor news website, which was released on Monday. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has urged Iran to provide an explanation for what he believes are "traces of uranium" discovered at locations "that were never reported as nuclear-related sites" by the Islamic Republic. The Islamic Republic dismisses the reported worries, pointing out that its nuclear energy program has undergone the broadest inspections regime in the Agency's history. The IAEA "has to behave and act technically" rather than politically, Amir Abdollahian stated in his interview, adding that "these seeming unfounded claims against Iran, that have been put on the agenda of the Agency (IAEA) need to be eliminated first." The senior diplomat said, "So, if the Agency chooses to, instead, focus on just the technical concerns, then we will surely attempt to strengthen and add to our collaboration." He made reference to a procedure that was comparable in 2015, when the IAEA concluded its investigation into the purported previous military dimensions (PMD) of Iran's nuclear program with a decision that permitted the implementation of the nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1 countries. He stated that "political will needs to exist to close the case of these claims," just like in 2015. When asked why Iran hasn't engaged in direct negotiations with the United States to resolve the unresolved concerns surrounding the 2015 agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Amir Abdollahian said Americans did convey a message to the Iranian side requesting, "Let's talk directly," last week in New York. Iran's foreign minister stated, "We are not afraid to have direct talks with the United States, but we should feel that it will be a game changer, that there will be some kind of gain for us," adding, "If the Americans are serious, and they are willing to show their willingness and desire to get back to the JCPOA, these indirect messages will suffice." When asked if Iran would accept additional rounds of indirect negotiations with the U.S. organized by the EU in the absence of direct talks, Amir Abdollahian said that he did not necessarily see a cause to do so. “However, if the American side believes that the coordinators—I mean, EU foreign policy leader, Josep Borrell, and the EU—need to have another round of negotiations, we won't object.” Iran views the charges leveled against it as the product of external pressures on the IAEA, particularly from Israel, who provide the Agency with false information about the nation's nuclear program. Iran's ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, Mohsen Naziri, stated earlier in the month that the Islamic Republic's approach to the IAEA has always been based on collaboration and dialogue. In relation to the Islamic Republic, the IAEA was also required to "perform its inherent obligation" and maintain its professionalism, impartiality, and independence, he continued. Naziri said that despite this, the Agency had succumbed to "political pressures" from beyond.
