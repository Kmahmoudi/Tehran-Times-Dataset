According to Zhang, who praised Tehran’s ties to other SCO members, “We are certain that, given its rich civilizational and historical background, Iran can serve as an active and productive member in expanding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s field of action and strength.” In May, China’s SCO National Coordinator, Zhang Haizhou, said that more and more countries are applying to join the SCO family.
