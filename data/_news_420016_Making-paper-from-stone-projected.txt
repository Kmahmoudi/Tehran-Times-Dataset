TEHRAN - Iran Stone Association is planning to carry out a project to manufacture paper from stone waste, ISNA quoted the secretary of Iran Stone Association as saying on Wednesday. If carried out, the project will lead to opening a factory with the annual capacity of producing 50,000 to 100,000 tons of stone paper, Ahmad Sharifi highlighted. “A portion of the domestic demand for paper can be satisfied accordingly,” he added.  Sharifi went on to say that opening a factory with the production capacity of 50,000 tons of stone paper requires $30 million investment. Since the total cost of producing paper from stone waste is 25 percent lower than that of wood and also, because stone papers maintains higher quality, the economic justification of the project is guaranteed, he concluded.  MAH/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
