TEHRAN – Kamal Kharrazi, head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, said on Wednesday that some Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia use terrorist groups as a tool to reach their objectives.
 Karrazi made the remarks during the second summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia held in Beijing, China. “In addition to some regional countries, the Western countries, especially the U.S., have created atmosphere for activities of the terrorist groups be it in Iraq or Syria through military intervention,” he stated. Karrazi who foreign minister from 1997 to 2005 said interventions by regional and extra-regional countries in the region rob the opportunity of the people to make proper “political changes” by themselves. He also said that “political structures” in some Persian Gulf Arab countries are formulated in a way that their “ideological products” cannot be anything other than terrorist groups such as Daesh. “Such groups are combination of religious extremism such as Wahhabism and a kind of tribal sovereignty,” the former chief diplomat remarked. Elsewhere, Kharrazi said military solution cannot settle crises. Problems can only be solved through “collective efforts” and “multilateral dialogues”, he noted. He also said that security in the Middle East region can only be established by healing the old Palestinian wound. NA/PA
