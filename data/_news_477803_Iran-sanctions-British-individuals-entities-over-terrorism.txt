TEHRAN - The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday issued a statement declaring sanctions against a number of British individuals and institutes for their support of terrorism, inciting violence, and violating human rights.

 The Foreign Ministry announced the embargoes are a "tit for tat" move against the sanctions that have been imposed by some European countries on Iran, Press TV reported. The statement went on to name three entities and nine individuals that have been blacklisted under the Islamic Republic of Iran's sanctions regime. The named entities include the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), Volant Media, Global Media, and DMA Media and anti-Iran TV channels that they support namely, the BBC Persian and Iran International. According to the statement, sanctions have been imposed on Minister of State for Security Tom Tugendhat, Royal Navy Commodore Don MacKinnon, Chair of the Labour Friends of Israel in House of Commons Steve McCabe, Chair of Conservative Friends of Israel in House of Commons Stephen Crabb, and honorary chair of Conservative Friends of Israel in House of Lords Stuart Polak. The sanctions have also targeted Conservative member of the House of Commons Bob Blackman, Member of the House of Commons and former secretary of state for environment Theresa Villiers, British politician Anthea McIntyre, and former Chief of the General Staff General Mark Carleton-Smith. Reminding the British government of its international commitments to confront terrorism, hatred and rights abuse, the Foreign Ministry said failing to confront the actions of the named entities or facilitating their measures amount to a gross violation of the UKâ€™s commitments at the international scene. The sanctions will bar the targeted individuals from obtaining visas and entering Iran and will freeze their possible assets and bank accounts inside Iran. The Foreign Ministry also noted that Iran holds the UK government to account for backing terrorists and human rights violators who are "organizing and inciting riots and terrorist acts" in Iran from the UK soil. Earlier Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who visited EB patients as victims of sanctions, had said that new sanctions will be imposed on some European individuals and entities for violating human rights and abetting recent deadly riots in Iran. The ministry's decision came just two days after EU council of foreign ministers decided to levy sanctions against 11 Iranian individuals and four entities over the country's response to the foreign-instigated riots that followed the death of young Iranian woman Mahsa Amini. Mahsa Amini who had been arrested by morality police in Tehran on September 13 to receive training on dress code fainted and later pronounced dead in hospital three days later. After a thorough study, the Forensic Medicine Organization determined that she had died not because of a trauma or a blow to her vital bodily organs.
