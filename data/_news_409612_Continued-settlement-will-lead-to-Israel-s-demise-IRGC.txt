TEHRAN – A spokesman for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps on Thursday said that, by going ahead with settlement constructions, the Israeli regime is risking “complete destruction,” as it will “definitely provoke a reaction,” Tasnim reported. The statement from the IRGC comes a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry criticized Israel’s activities in occupied Palestine, while playing down the United States’ role in facilitating the passage of the UN Security Council’s anti-settlement resolution.
