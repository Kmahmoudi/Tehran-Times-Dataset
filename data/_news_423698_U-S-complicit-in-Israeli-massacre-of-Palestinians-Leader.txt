Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei has condemned the recent slaughter of Palestinians who protested the U.S. move to relocate its embassy to al-Quds (Jerusalem), saying Washington and some of its Western allies are complicit. Addressing a Quranic meeting on Thursday night, the Leader decried the Zionist regime’s killing and injuring of hundreds of Palestinians on Monday and said, “Some people complain why America does not take a stance against it. America and some Western countries are complicit; do you expect them to oppose it?!” Ayatollah Khamenei further deplored some Islamic countries’ silence on the killings, and said, “It is the Muslim states that should take a stance against it (the massacre of Palestinians).” “Muslim states are the ones that should rise up but they do not because they have distanced themselves from Quran and do not believe in Quran,” the Leader remarked. “The calamity that has befallen on some Muslim societies is due to ignoring Quran.” “By God’s grace, Palestine will be freed from the vicious enemies. Al-Quds is the capital of Palestine and America and its stooges cannot do a damn thing against the truth and the divine tradition regarding Palestine,” Ayatollah Khamenei noted.
