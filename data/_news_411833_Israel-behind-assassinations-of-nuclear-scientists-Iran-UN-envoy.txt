The Iranian ambassador to the United Nation’s International Atomic Energy Agency said on Thursday that “Israel-hired terrorists” were behind the assassinations of several nuclear scientists in recent years.
 “While nuclear scientists across the entire Middle East have been assassinated by Israeli-hired terrorists, the regime’s nuclear experts are allowed access to some countries’ nuclear facilities,” Reza Najafi said. Speaking at a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, Najafi also said Israel has been turning a blind eye to international nuclear treaties and the international community have been ignoring it. “Unfortunately, the Zionist Regime has ignored the rightful requests of the international community in the last years, and having the blind support of some Western countries and with infringing all international laws and regulations, has pushed its dangerous military nuclear program forward,” the ambassador lamented. Previous UN resolutions proposed by Arab states seeking to pressure Israel into nuclear transparency have been unsuccessful. Reports in September said Arab members of the IAEA will refrain from introducing resolutions urging Israel to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and put its nuclear facilities under international oversight.
