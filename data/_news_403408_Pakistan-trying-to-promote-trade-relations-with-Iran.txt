Pakistani Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz Monday said Pakistan was trying to promote trade relations with Iran following the lifting of international sanctions. Responding to an adjournment motion moved by MQM's Muhammad Atteeq Shaikh in the Senate, he said a memorandum of understanding (MOU) had already been inked for declaring Gwadar and Chabahar as sister ports. There was a suggestion to establish a railway link between Gwadar and Chabahar, he added. He said the region needed more ports and there would be no threat to Gwadar Port from Chabahar Port.
