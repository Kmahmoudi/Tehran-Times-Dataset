TEHRAN – Around 300,000 individuals suffering from multiple disability will receive allowance on a monthly basis, deputy director of Tehran’s welfare organization for rehabilitation affairs said on Sunday.  Mohammad Reza Asadi stated that according to the bill on rights of persons with disabilities those who suffer from multiple disability and are not able to work will receive a monthly allowance of 9.5 million rials (about $250), YJC reported. Majlis [the Iranian parliament] hammered out a law on rights of persons with disabilities on the final days of the year 2017. The law is aimed to improve the living conditions of persons with disability by introducing measures which were neglected in the past. As per an article of the law the administration should allocate the required budget to pay a minimum wage to those persons with multiple disabilities who don’t have the physical capabilities to work.
