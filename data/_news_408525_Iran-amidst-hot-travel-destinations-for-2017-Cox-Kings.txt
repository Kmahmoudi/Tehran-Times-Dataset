TEHRAN – Major India-headquartered tour operator Cox & Kings Ltd. has announced its forecast for next year, with Iran amongst the hot destinations in 2017. The operator, known for its annual predictions about travel trends for centuries, said demand from clients to travel back to Iran has been “remarkable but not surprising”, TTG Media reported on November 21. Iran, used to be one of the most popular tours offered by Cox & Kings, was reintroduced to its Middle East collection in October 2015 for the first time since 2011. Cox & Kings added the country has been even more accessible since the British Airways relaunched its direct flights in September. Jordan, Russia, Chile and India are amongst other countries that Cox & Kings has put on the list. In September, Mastercard Global Destinations Cities Index released its annual report, placing Tehran at ninth place among the top-ten fastest growing destination cities. The Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization has said over 16 million foreign tourists visited Iran during the past three and a half years, fetching $24 billion of revenues.
