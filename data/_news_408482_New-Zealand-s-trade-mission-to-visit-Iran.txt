New Zealand’s Trade Minister Todd McClay and opposition MPs will travel to Iran over the next week to take part in a number of trade-related events. McClay says New Zealand needs to engage more broadly in trade-related activities in Europe and Iran and this mission would offer a valuable opportunity to promote New Zealand goods and services in these lucrative markets. The Trade Minister will travel to Iran with a delegation of 17 New Zealand companies. “Iran has traditionally been a very important market for our sheep meat and butter. Earlier this year the visiting Iranian Foreign Minister said Iran presented a $1 billion prospect for New Zealand. This mission will be an important first step towards delivering on this exciting opportunity,” McClay said.
