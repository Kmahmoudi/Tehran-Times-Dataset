TEHRAN – Iran’s Navy is going to equip its vessels with a point-defense weapon system that has passed all tests, a military official said. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Rear Admiral Ali Kaviani, a Navy commander, said the system has passed all tests on the ground and in the sea, and will be installed on the vessels by the end of the current Iranian year (March 20). In recent years, the Navy has made great advances in making homegrown equipment and has increased its presence in high seas. MH/PA
