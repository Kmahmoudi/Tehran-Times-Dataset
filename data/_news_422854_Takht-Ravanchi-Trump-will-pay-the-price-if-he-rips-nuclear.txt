TEHRAN – Majid Takht-Ravanchi, deputy director of the presidential chief of staff for political affairs, has warned against the consequences of U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement, saying Trump will have to “pay the price” if he exits the deal.

 If one party withdraws from the pact, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), it would be “meaningless” to the Islamic Republic to continue the agreement, Takht-Ravanchi, who was involved in crafting the nuclear agreements with 5+1 group, said in an interview with the Khorasan newspaper published on Saturday. The JCPOA is a two-way equation, and the equation’s balance should not be upset, he stressed.
