TEHRAN – The United States is not the only superpower in the world anymore as a multipolar world is on the rise and U.S. power is fading, says Yahya Rahim Safavi, a top military adviser to the Leader. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, General Safavi also denounced the anti-Iran remarks by the U.S. secretary of state, saying such “hostile remarks” are deemed unacceptable by the Iranian nation and the world, the YJC reported. Safavi, who was chief of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps from 1997-2007, also said U.S. President Donald Trump is delusional and “that’s why he believes toppling the Islamic Republic is possible.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
