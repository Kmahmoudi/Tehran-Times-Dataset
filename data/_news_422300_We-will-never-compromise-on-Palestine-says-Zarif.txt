TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says Iranians have made the Palestinian cause an ideal of their own, stressing that the Islamic Republic will never compromise on this issue.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran sees the problems of Palestine as its own, like all other friends and neighboring Muslims and their security and freedom as their own security and freedom,” Zarif said in an article in the Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak published on Monday. On Friday, at least 17 Palestinians lost their lives when Israeli military forces opened fire on thousands of protesters who had flocked to a sit-in near the Gaza border.
