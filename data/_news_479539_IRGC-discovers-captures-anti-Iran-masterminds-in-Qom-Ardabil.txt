TEHRAN- Several of the leaders of the counter-revolutionary organizations responsible for recent disturbances in the holy city of Qom and the northwest province of Ardabil have been detained by the Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC). According to the IRGC's intelligence body, several leaders of a foreign-backed network and its ringleaders who were active in cyberspace and actively engaged in carrying out anti-security measures were identified and apprehended in Qom on Thursday. In a statement, the IRGC intelligence unit said that during the most recent riots "the members of the network had extensive activities in the field of calling for riots, encouraging to spray slogans, handing out flyers, insulting the clergy and other actions that disturb public security." The statement also said that more information on the case will soon be made public. The Intelligence Organization of the IRGC also reported the capture of three people in Ardabil who were part of a network connected to anti-revolutionary groups. Based on the statement from the Intelligence Organization, the suspects planned to use Molotov cocktails and arson assaults to disrupt Iran's national security and destroy government and military facilities. The statement added, “In addition to plotting acts of destruction, the network moved to communicate with counterrevolutionary media, and by creating multiple accounts in social networks took other criminal measures such as disturbing the public mind, disseminating misinformation, mudslinging and directing rioters.” Foreign-backed riots have swept through numerous Iranian cities following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, at a hospital on September 16, three days after fainting at a police station. An investigation determined that Amini's death was caused by her medical condition rather than reported police violence. According to the Interior Ministry, 200 people, including security personnel, have been killed in the violent riots. The riots laid the grounds for terrorist acts.  Before the evening prayers on October 26, a terrorist with links to Daesh targeted the Shah Cheragh shrine in the south-central city of Shiraz, killing at least 13 pilgrims, among them a woman and two children. 40 worshippers were also wounded.
