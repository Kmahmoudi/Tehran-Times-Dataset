TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution has refuted the possibility that economic sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program could exist at the same time.

 Under the nuclear agreement, aka Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is obliged to put restrictions on its nuclear activities in exchange for termination of economic and financial sanctions. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was speaking on Monday on the anniversary of the demise of Imam Khomeini, said European powers better not plan on keeping Iran in the deal while sanctions are also imposed. “Statements made by some European states indicate that they expect the Iranian nation to both endure sanctions and to abandon their nuclear activities, which is the undoubtable future need of the country, and to live on with the restrictions already imposed. Let me tell these states that such disturbed dreams will not come true,” Ayatollah Khamenei stated. He also said that following the U.S. decision to abandon the JCPOA, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) must make preparations to increase uranium enrichment capacity “up to a level of 190,000 SWUs (separative work units). “The Atomic Energy Organization is required to swiftly make due preparations for 190,000 SWUs, for the time being, within the JCPOA framework,” the Leader stated. Following his speech, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) announced that it had made preparations so that the country could reach 190,000 SWUs of uranium enrichment capacity within 10 months at the Natanz nuclear site. Ali Akbar Salehi, who heads the AEOI, made the announcement on television on Wednesday night following the inauguration of the montage center at the Natanz plant in central Iran. “We had designated Natanz for producing one million SUWs, and have provided the required infrastructure,” he said. SWUs are a measure unit of uranium enrichment capacity. “Within 10 months, with the launch of a set of newly-built enclosures, we could produce 190,000 SWUs at Natanz,” said Salehi. However, he added, “this does not mean we start the production of advanced centrifuges for industrial use at this facility.”  At this facility, he added, Iran would assemble centrifuges while staying within the limits outlined in the 2015 nuclear deal. The comments followed the AEOI’s letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), informing the UN nuclear watchdog, which monitors the technical aspect of the JCPOA's implementation, of the start of certain nuclear activities at Natanz.
