TEHRAN – The Iranian women active in the field of financial technology (fintech) will attend the 5th edition of Finup Women on June 27 at the Amir Kabir University of Technology. During the event, a meeting will be held on regulatory technology, known as RegTech, a new field within the financial services industry that utilizes information technology to enhance regulatory processes. Four females who are active in renowned startups will also make speech during the event. Finup Women, the first educational-interactive event in the field of fintech in Iran, has been held four times since September 2017. Fintech is a portmanteau of financial technology that describes an emerging financial services sector in the 21st century.  Originally, the term Fintech applied to technology to the back-end of established consumer and trade financial institutions. Since the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the term has expanded to include any technological innovation in the financial sector, including innovations in financial literacy and education, retail banking, investment and even crypto-currencies like bitcoin.   SB/PA END All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
