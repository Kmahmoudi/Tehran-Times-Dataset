TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has lauded Basij as the nation’s great wealth and God-given reserve, saying the enemies have always been seeking to destroy or nullify it. “Basij is a great and brilliant relic of the late Imam, and a manifestation of national power, and an exhibition of purity, sincerity, insight, and struggle,” Ayatollah Khamenei said in a message on Wednesday on the anniversary of Basij Day. “In defending the country and its independence and stability, in providing vital services on a national scale, in leading scientific activities and new technologies, in valued approaches and creating a spiritual atmosphere, it is the name of Basij that comes up and the presence of Basij that draws attention,” the Leader wrote. He called on Basij forces to further concentrate on thwarting the enemy’s plots and wished for their success in their endeavors. In a statement on Sunday, the Army described Basij as one of the effective institutions in foiling the conspiracies of enemies. “Today, Basij is a driving force for growth, progress, development and achieving sublime goals of the Islamic Republic of Iran, inspiring the sincere and loyal forces of the country and has been turned into a symbol of realizing the slogan of ‘We Can’,” the Army stated. “The Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran considers Basij forces as the powerful and strong arm of the establishment who are ready to stand against soft and hard attacks of enemies under the auspices of the headship of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in line with thwarting all conspiracies of enemies and ill-wishers of the establishment,” it added.
