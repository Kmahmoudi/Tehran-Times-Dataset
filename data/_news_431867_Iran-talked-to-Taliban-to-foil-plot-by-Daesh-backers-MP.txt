TEHRAN - Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh has said that Iran held talks with Taliban to foil plots by Daesh supports in Afghanistan.
 “Iran held talks with Taliban in line with maintaining stability in Afghanistan and foiling Daesh supporters’ plot,” he told ILNA in an interview published on Monday. He noted that holding talks does not mean recognize a group. “The Islamic Republic of Iran had differences and serious tension with Taliban which have been resolved due to historic reasons,” he noted. The senior lawmaker added that it is a reality that Taliban has gained power in Afghanistan. “The Islamic Republic is seeing dangers worse than Taliban in Afghanistan. The U.S. is following a policy of transferring heads of Daesh to this country to create a new situation,” he revealed. He noted that in this situation actions must be taken against empowerment of Daesh in Afghanistan which make it essential to cooperate with Taliban. He also said Tehran’s talks with Taliban are with coordination of the Afghan government. The Foreign Ministry announced that Iranian diplomats held a meeting with a Taliban delegation in Tehran on December 30. Abbas Araqchi, the deputy foreign minister for political affairs, headed the Iranian negotiating team. Araqchi met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in the Arg presidential palace in Kabul on January 5 to brief him about the meeting in Tehran. Defense Minister Amir Hatami also said on January 7 that Iran’s talks with Taliban are aimed at restoring peace and stability to Afghanistan. Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, a top military adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, said on Wednesday that Iran can help the Taliban and the Afghan government reach a common understanding for stabilizing the central Asian country. In an interview with IRNA, Firouzabadi said security in Afghanistan is very important for Iran.
