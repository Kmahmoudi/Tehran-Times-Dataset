TEHRAN – The seventh edition of the Tehran National Sculpture Biennial opened at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMCA) on Tuesday after a six-year hiatus. “Art biennials are the beating hearts of the artists’ community in each society,” the secretary of the biennial, Kurosh Golnari, said during an opening ceremony, which was attended by TMCA director Ali-Mohammad Zare’ and groups artists and art aficionados.  He expressed his hope that the event could reach its zenith in six years. About 80 works are being displayed at the biennial, which will run until October 14. This year for the first time, the Visual Arts Office entrusted the organizing of the biennial to the Iranian Sculptors Society in the line with the government’s major policy to lessen its involvement in cultural events. “This same decision was also made about biennials for photography and miniature painting,” Visual Arts Office director Majid Mollanoruzi said. The office is keen to work on such events but only as a supporter, he added. The sixth edition of the biennial was also organized with a one-year hiatus in 2011.
