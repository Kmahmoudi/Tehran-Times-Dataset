"Negotiations are being held with Turkey and Iran to start a rail service to transport passengers and goods," Al-Qadissiya daily quoted Falah Hassan, acting director general of the Iraqi railways company, as saying. "The two countries have shown a real desire to open a rail link to Iraq," Hassan said, adding that the rail service to Iran would help link Iraq's railways with East Asia and Europe. Iraq and Syria in August resumed a rail service, 19 years after rail links between them were cut. (Reuter)
