TEHRAN – For many, bilateral relations between Tehran and Moscow have been more like “take the rough with the smooth.” Over the past decades, there have been challenges in between, including Russia’s delayed operationalization of Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, their performance during Iran’s nuclear row with the West, as well as the S-300 missile system contract. Whatever the nature, at no times the diplomatic cord has broken off and perhaps, for this reason the two have deemed it strategic. Ever since the Syrian conflict broke off in 2011, Tehran and Moscow have seen closer-than-ever relations, both unanimously backing the Syrian government and President Bashar al-Assad.
In what follows, Ali Akbar Velayati, top aid to the Supreme Leader, has shared his thoughts with the Tehran Times on defensive cooperation between Iran and Russia as well as the stance of the two on the future of Syria.
Velayati believes that there is no difference between the two states in terms of the future of President al-Assad, saying regional collaboration between Tehran and Moscow has just started. On defensive issues between Iran and Russia, the Iranian official sees no serious obstacles on the way as Moscow has relatively managed to fulfill its commitments. Below are the questions posed by the daily paper
Q. Is there any disagreement between Iran and Russia over the future of Syria and President Bashar al-Assad? Has Russians reduced their military helps to Syria? A. Russians have The cooperation between the two countries have just started, and we are at the beginning of some kind of regional cooperation.  We are after one common goal that is fighting against terrorism which is against the national interests of Russia and Iran. neither cut nor reduced their helps to the Syrian government and remained loyal to their friendly relations with Syria. To my knowledge and on the basis of the talks I held with President Putin during my recent visit of Moscow, he retreated Russia will be continuing its support for the Syrian government. So, I do strongly believe that there is no disagreement between Tehran and Moscow over the future of the Syrian government. The cooperation between the two countries have just started, and we are at the beginning of some kind of regional cooperation.  We are after one common goal that is fighting against terrorism which is against the national interests of Russia and Iran. However, that is not to say that there are no other future joint cooperation between the two countries, as the Shanghai cooperation is one to take as an example. Q. Cooperation between Moscow and Tehran in the defense sector has growingly been a challenge with the S-300 missile system, a case in point. There have been reports on Iran’s interest in purchasing Sukhoi Su-30 from Russia. What is the guarantee that the contract, if finalized, won’t be another S-300 case? A. From one side, Iran has signed some military pacts with Russia and we think we have been relatively successful in fulfilling the agreements.
For example, if you recall, there was huge propaganda by the Western media that Russians won’t be delivering the S-300 missile system to Iran. However, one month ago they delivered first parts of the system and I do think Russians will fulfill the agreements they signed with the Iranian side. And principally speaking, Tehran doesn’t see any major obstacles in fulfilling defense agreements with Moscow.
