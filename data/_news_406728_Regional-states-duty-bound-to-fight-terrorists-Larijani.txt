TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Saturday that all the countries in the Middle East region are duty bound to fight the terrorist groups.
 “Some regional countries’ support for the terrorists has undermined security in Iraq and Syria,” he said during a meeting with Iraqi Planning Minister Salman Ali Al-Jumaili in Tehran. Larijani highlighted the importance of finding “diplomatic” and “political” solution to crises in the region. He also said that historic and religious commonalities between Iran and Iraq are “firm support” for expanding political, parliamentary, economic and cultural relations. He said that removing banking obstacles, facilitating economic interaction between the private corporations and wavering visa for the Iranian and Iraqi pilgrims will help expansion of economic and cultural interaction. For his part, the Iraqi minister highlighted the importance of removing obstacles to expand relations between the two countries in various areas. Al-Jumaili also praised Iran for sharing its experiences in fighting terrorist groups. The Iranian and Iraqi people are “like brothers” and Iran’s supports have been effective in countering extremism and Takfiri ideology in Iraq, the minister said.  NA/PA
