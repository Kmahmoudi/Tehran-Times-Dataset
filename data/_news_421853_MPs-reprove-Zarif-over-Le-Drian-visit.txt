TEHRAN – Two lawmakers on Tuesday issued a warning to Foreign Minister Mohamamd Javad Zarif over inviting his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian to Tehran.  In an open session of the parliament, Hossein Naqavi Hosseini and Hossein-Ali Haji-Deligani issued the warning, demanding that the foreign minister explains why he had invited Le Drian, ignoring his anti-Iran stance. A number of MPs also called for revision of ties with France as it has been helping the anti-Iran front, Mehr reported. Prior to his Tehran visit, Le Drian criticized Iran’s missile program, saying Tehran could risk fresh sanctions if not letting go of its ballistic missiles.
