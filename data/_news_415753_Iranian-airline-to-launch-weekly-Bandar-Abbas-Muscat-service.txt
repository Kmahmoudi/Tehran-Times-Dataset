TEHRAN – Iran’s Kish Airlines has obtained a license from Oman’s Public Authority for Civil Aviation (PACA) to launch weekly flights connecting the port city of Bandar Abbas, southern Iran, to Oman’s capital city of Muscat. “The PACA gave its nod on August 3, authorizing the airliner to operate one flight a week between the southern Iranian port city and Omani capital as of August 7,” Muscat Daily reported on Sunday, adding that Kish Airlines will soon restart its flights to Muscat from its base in the Persian Gulf island of Kish. An official with Kish Airlines at its UAE office had told Muscat Daily: “We will be restarting the now suspended service between Muscat and Kish Island from August as well.” In line with promoting bilateral tourism ties, the two neighboring countries launched a cruise route in July that connects the port city of Khasab in Oman to the Iranian island of Qeshm.
