 However, Baeedinejad said the goals of the nuclear deal should not be lowered to economic benefits. Writing on his telegram, Baeedinejad said, “Iran has enough tools to put pressure on the other side. However, this should not cause us to ignore the important achievements of nuclear enrichment and other important nuclear programs.  Secondly, we should not lower objectives of the JCPOA to economic benefits. And thirdly, by lowering the values of important economic and commercial steps following the JCPOA, which has led to important openings for our country and the cancellation of tens of sanctions in transport, shipping, insurance, …, oil export and petrochemical products…” it is not acceptable to “announce that the JCPOA has had not result.” He added, “It is enough not to forget the situation in the past. Be sure that nobody denies the achievements.”   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
