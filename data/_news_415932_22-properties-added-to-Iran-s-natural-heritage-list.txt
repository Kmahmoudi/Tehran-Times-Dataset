TEHRAN – Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization has recently inscribed 22 natural spots and landscapes on the national heritage list, IRNA reported on Saturday. The properties are located in the provinces of South Khorasan, Mazandaran, and Qazvin in eastern, northern, and west central parts of the country respectively and some of which are associated with the Cretaceous and Quaternary geological eras, said Ali Qomi, an official with the CHTHO. Amongst the most prominent ones on the shortlist are the Lake of Ghosts and the Danial Cave both in Mazandaran and the Black Land of Tabas in South Khorasan, he added. The Black Land is situated some 120 kilometers south of Tabas and in the northernmost point in the Naiband Wildlife Refuge. This geological phenomenon dates from the last glacial period, which started about two million years ago, the official explained. The Lake of Ghosts can be traced back to sometime between the Middle Cretaceous to the Quaternary periods, Qomi noted. Measuring roughly 300 by 700 meters, the lake is peppered with some dead threes that contribute to the scenic vista of the lake that is positioned in the heart of a forest, he added. The official also briefed about the Danial Cave which is located 5 km south of Salmanshahr in Mazandaran province, saying that the property features two bat halls, needle-shaped stalactites, fixed temperature throughout the year and drinkable water. Qomi added that the cave is situated in the intersection of two faults that come from different geological eras. Having an opulent tourist circuit with 22 UNESCO World Heritage sites, Iran seeks to acquire greater share of the global tourism industry by 2025.
