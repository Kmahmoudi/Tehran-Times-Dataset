TEHRAN – American writer Richard Brautigan’s “Willard and His Bowling Trophies: A Perverse Mystery” has recently been published in Persian by Nimaj Publications in Tehran.  Translated by Farid Qadami, the 1975 book is about a papier mache bird that shares the front room of a San Francisco apartment with a collection of bowling trophies. The bird witnesses the problems of the human tenants of this apartment, which are comically sad. ABU/YAW
