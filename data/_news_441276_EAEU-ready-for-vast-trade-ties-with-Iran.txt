Iran is a very important market in the region and development of ties with this country is of high significance for the EAEU members, the official underscored and said that signing a free trade agreement between Iran and this union has laid the ground for the expansion of cooperation. “We believe that trade ties with Iran should be increased and all sides should benefit from the created condition”, Nikishina commented.
