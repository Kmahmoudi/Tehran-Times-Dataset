TEHRAN- Iran Air, the flag carrier airline of Iran, will take delivery of the third newly purchased Airbus jets today.

 The 330-200 Airbus is to land at Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport at 5:00 P.M., according to a report by ISNA. During a visit by President Hassan Rouhani to Paris in January 2016, Iran provisionally ordered 118 Airbus jets worth $27 billion. The first and the second planes that Iran has purchased from the European aviation giant Airbus landed in Tehran on January 12 and March 11, 2017, respectively. Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi announced in mid-January that renovation of Iran Air fleet has begun, adding that according to the contracts with world major plane makers, Iran Air is to receive 200 new planes, of which 100 will be purchased from Airbus and 80 from Boeing.
