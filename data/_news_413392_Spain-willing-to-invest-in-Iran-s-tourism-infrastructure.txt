TEHRAN – Spain is willing to invest in tourism and hospitality infrastructures across Iran, IRNA quoted Matilde Pastora Asian Gonzalez, Secretary of State for Tourism of Spain, as saying on Friday. She made the remarks during a meeting with Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization Deputy Director Morteza Rahmani-Movahhed on the sidelines of the 105th UNWTO Executive Council, which was held in Madrid on May 11 and 12. Referring to Iran’s high tourism potentials, growing bilateral relations and Iran’s ‘good’ relations with the European Union, Asian Gonzalez called for widening mutual ties in particular the role of Spanish investors in Iran. She also showed interest to personally visit the Iranian cities and Isfahan in particular. Rahmani-Movahhed for his part called for launching direct flights between Tehran and Madrid while suggesting to devise a visa simplification scheme for the two nations. Exchange of media representatives, tour operators, and travel associates with the aim of developing bilateral tourism relations were among other topics that were discussed in the meeting. Earlier this month, Iran’s Revitalization and Utilization Fund for Historical Places inked a memorandum of understanding with the Spanish hospitality company Paradores in a bid to refurbish some historical structures and repurpose them into lodging facilities.
