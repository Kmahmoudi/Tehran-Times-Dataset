TEHRAN- Ebrahim Raisi, the President of Iran, stated on Sunday that it will not be in the interests of the United States or other Western nations to back riots in Iran. Addressing his cabinet, Raisi directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to adopt diplomatic and legal strategies to neutralize the seditions planned abroad. Referring to the Sunday remarks of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Raisi said the government, as one of the parties addressed in the Leader’s speech, feels strongly committed to make more efforts in various areas to “resolve the people's problems, create social jubilance, and generate hope in the country.” He went on to say that the foes have launched a byzantine campaign to obstruct the country's growth by disrupting security, economy, education, and production sector. "Side by side with the executive body’s double-efforts aimed at serving the people to a greater extent…, the security, disciplinary, and judicial organizations, too, have great responsibilities to preserve the people's security and the country's capitals," Raisi insisted. Based on remarks delivered by Raisi, it is extremely saddening and heartbreaking that rioters kill children, adults, and security guards.  The concerned bodies must deal with rioters in accordance with law and draw up mechanisms to prevent the terrorists and rioters to take toll on people or destroy property, asserted Raisi.  He added these are “urgent requests” from the general public. The president also said it is imperative for Iranian media to broadcast news transparently, precisely and on time as the enemies have launched a propaganda and “mind-control” campaign against the Islamic system through airing fake news and false narrations in the incidents happening in the country. Raisi declared that the United States, France, and several other European nations clearly sponsored terrorism and riots, cautioning them that doing so would not be in their best interests. Since Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, tragically died in a hospital on September 16, three days after collapsing at a police station in Tehran, protests, supported by foreign governments, have erupted in certain Iranian cities. Following an inquiry, it was revealed that Amini's illness, was to blame for her passing. The violent riots have resulted in the deaths of dozens of citizens and security personnel. The rioters have killed Basijs and other security forces over the past two months in addition to torching public property. The most horrific incident took place on November 16 in which seven people, including a 10-year-old boy named Kian Pirfalak, were killed in a shooting spree in the city of Izeh in the southwestern province of Khuzestan. Raisi also expressed confidence that the national football team will make Iranians happy with their magnificent participation in the Qatar World Cup games. "I am sure the players in our country's national football team with their brave, noble and pride-inspiring presence in that important field will do all their best to present a good performance to fill the hearts of the Iranians with joy," he added. He also wished Qatar success in hosting this round of the World Cup at the highest possible level.
