TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has formulated guidelines for Iranian documentary filmmakers in a letter, which has been referred to by Persian news agencies as “The Revolution’s Charter of Documentary”.

 He sent the letter to the documentary filmmakers just one day after a meeting with a group of them on January 11. The letter, which is comprised of five guidelines, was unveiled during a special ceremony at the Art Bureau on Sunday evening. In his first advice, the Leader asked filmmakers to “Preserve carefully the revolutionary course. Do not displace the revolutionary morality with technical effects or professional renown. Confirm honorably by your tongue and your actions that you are a revolutionary believer.”  “The enemy’s soft war has been set up based on lies, distortion, rumors, censorship and boycotts. Your art can neutralize the enemy’s actions,” the second advice reads. In his third guidance, the Leader said, “An intention of the enemy is to stimulate disappointment and pessimism. Reasons for hope are numerous in the country. Your art is able to kindle hope, zeal and movement based on the realities.” “A critical documentary film is useful and also necessary. It should be conscientious and redemptive in approach. An aggressive, demeaning and anarchistic manner of criticism turns its advantage into damage. Satirical language helps the documentary be more useful and efficient,” the fourth guide reads.          “Consider God’s satisfaction in your works and ask Him for help,” the letter concluded.
