TEHRAN – Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has made a case against the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS, rejecting that it has been successful so far.  The Leader made the remarks on Tuesday in a meeting with visiting Slovenian President Borut Pahor who arrived at Tehran late on Monday for a formal visit at the head of a trade delegation.  The U.S.’s anti-ISIS campaign has been a failure as Washington neither intends nor can uproot ISIS in the Middle East region, the Leader emphasized. The Leader elaborated on two standpoints in this regard. “According to the first view, the Americans have no plan to exterminate Daesh… and intend to act in such a way vis-à-vis Daesh that this problem would remain unresolved in Iraq or Syria.”  On the basis of a second scenario, the U.S. is open to a solution to get rid of ISIS but the situation does not allow it to achieve the goal.  “Under the second view, the Americans are willing to resolve the issue of Daesh but mechanisms are not in such a way that make them able to do this…”  The Supreme Leader also called for a multipronged effort by all independent governments, urging them to be more active in the international arena.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran has always been calling on independent countries to play an active role in standing against exercising pressures on nations, and has asked them not to be silent and a bystander.”  On regional conflicts and the role of Iran in war-torn area, the Leader noted, “It behooves all countries to make efforts to quench the flames of the conflicts, and the Islamic Republic (of Iran), despite the propaganda by the arrogant current, is active and influential to achieve such goal, but it does not meddle in the affairs of other countries.”  Elsewhere in his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to far-reaching implications of insecurity in countries in the Middle East, saying, “Whereas European countries failed to give refuge to tens of thousands of refugees, it has been for years that Iran is hosting nearly three millions of the Afghani people and has provided them with education and living conditions…”  He also rapped the Saudi invasion of Yemen, saying, “Independent governments must counter such incidents because pressuring a nation is in fact a pain and suffering for all humanity.”  The Leader further referred to numerous potentialities of Iran and Slovenia for the expansion of cooperation, expressing hope the talks held in Iran translate into closer ties in the future.   The Slovenian president, for his part, said he had held very good talks with senior Iranian officials and expressed his country’s keenness to deepen relations with Iran in all fields. Pahor added that Iran and Slovenia share plenty of experience and enjoy great potential for cooperation. AK/PA
