TEHRAN – The Iranian Navy’s 41th flotilla of warships will dock in Bandar Abbas port on Monday, Mehr reported. 
Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari will take salute, welcoming the flotilla.
The flotilla left Bandar Abbas port for the Gulf of Aden on June 1 to protect Iranian cargo ships and oil tankers against pirates. 
The Iranian Navy has been conducting anti-piracy patrols in the region as of November 2008, when Somali raiders seized the Iranian-chartered cargo ship, MV Delight, off the coast of Yemen.
