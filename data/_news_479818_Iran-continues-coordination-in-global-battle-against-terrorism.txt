TEHRAN- Saeed Iravani, Iran's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said on Friday that the Islamic Republic will continue to cooperate with international efforts to uproot terrorism. Iravani stated that Iran will continue to cooperate with all nations, especially those in South and West Asia, notably Pakistan, in the battle against terrorism. Speaking on the occasion of the 8th anniversary of the victims of a terrorist assault against a public school in Peshawar, Pakistan, he said, “As two neighbors, Iran and Pakistan have always shared sufferings and pleasure, difficulties and opportunities, and have both suffered from terrorism.” The ambassador emphasized that Iran's core position is to denounce terrorism in all its forms, stating that his nation is one of the primary victims of terrorism in the globe. So far over 17,000 Iranians have fallen victim to terrorist operations over the last four decades, he stated. Iravani also referred to a recent attack by the Daesh terrorist group on the Shah Cheraq mausoleum in Shiraz, a city in southcentral Iran, which resulted in the martyrdom of 13 people.
