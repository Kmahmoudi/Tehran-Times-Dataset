TEHRAN – The deputy commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has described missiles as Iran's "main defense asset" and therefore indispensable to its military might. Brigadier General Hossein Salami made the remarks on the sidelines of a gathering at the Supreme National Defense University in Tehran on Monday amid a U.S.-led push against Iran's missile capability. “Missiles are among the defensive assets and main deterrent elements of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we can never accept to disarm ourselves of our deterrent capability,” Salami was quoted by Press TV as saying.
