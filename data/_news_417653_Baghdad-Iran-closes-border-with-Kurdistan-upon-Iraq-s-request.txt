TEHRAN – The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that Iran has shut its border crossings to the Kurdistan region at the request of the Iraqi central government. Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Mahjub said in a statement that the closure of the border crossings was in the frame of measures taken by the Iraqi government to control the border ports and airports in the region. He also said the decision came after the Iraqi Kurdistan held “the unconstitutional referendum”.
