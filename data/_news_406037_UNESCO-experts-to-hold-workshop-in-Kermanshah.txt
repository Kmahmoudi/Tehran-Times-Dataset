TEHRAN â€“ A panel of UNESCO-affiliated experts of cultural heritage will hold a workshop in the western Iranian city of Kermanshah from September 7 to 10, a senior local official said on Wednesday. Jalil Balai, the director of Kermanshah Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Department, also expressed hope the event would provide residents with an opportunity to properly introduce their history, culture, and handicrafts to the UNESCO experts. Practical skills and knowledge for the safeguarding and conservation of cultural heritage relics are amongst the subjects to be touched during the workshop. The four-day training course will be held adjacent to the Bisotun prehistoric center, which has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list since 2010. Bisotun linking the Iranian high plateau with Mesopotamia features remains from the prehistoric times to the Median, Achaemenid, Sassanian, and Ilkhanid periods.
