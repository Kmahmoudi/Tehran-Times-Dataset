TEHRAN - Indonesia has been devastated by a series of tsunamis in recent months and authorities have warned that more deadly tsunamis could strike the country’s coastline in coming days. At least 281 people have died from the latest tsunami, which struck the Indonesian coastline without warning Saturday night. Hundreds of others are injured and many more are missing. Eyewitnesses quoted by local media described fleeing for their lives as beachfront homes were swept away in the catastrophic wave, caused by underwater landslides following the eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman at Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency, warned Sunday that more tsunamis were possible as long as the volcano remained active. "We are cautioning the people to remain cautious," Sutopo said. "Agencies are still continuing to analyze the root cause ... the Krakatau volcano continues to erupt, which could potentially trigger another tsunami." In the wake of Saturday's disaster, Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geological Agency (BMKG) to purchase detectors which would provide "early warnings to community." A lack of warning was blamed for the high death toll in October tsunami which killed more than 2,000 people on the western coast of Sulawesi. President Widodo headed to the disaster zone on Monday, saying on his official Twitter that he was praying for the victims of the tsunami.   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
