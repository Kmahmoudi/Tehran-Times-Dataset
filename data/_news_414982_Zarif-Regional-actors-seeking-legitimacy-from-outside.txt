TEHRAN – Unlike self-reliant Iran, regional states try to acquire “legitimacy” and “security” from external sources, the Iranian foreign minister said on Monday. 

 “Regional powers eye on outside to acquire legitimacy and security,” Mohammad Javad Zarif told literati in Tehran. “Currently, these countries are either under the supportive umbrella of a foreign country or expect such support from foreign systems,” Zarif added.  The comments were a clear reference to archrival Saudi Arabia which signed a hefty arms sales deal with the U.S. during President Trump’s May visit to Riyadh.  Saudi Arabia’s animosity with Iran began after Iran concluded a historic agreement with great powers over its nuclear program in July 2015.
 
Tensions exacerbated after 464 Iranians were crushed to death in a Hajj ritual in Mecca in September 2015. Iran held Saudi responsible for the tragedy, saying it was a result of mismanagement.
Relations suffered another blow after Saudi Arabia executed Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr by Riyadh.  After the execution angry mobs stormed Saudi diplomatic posts in Tehran and Mashhad. Though Iran condemned the attacks, Riyadh severed all diplomatic ties with Tehran.  Ever since, the two sides, who back opposing sides in Syria, have been trading barbs at each other on a wide range of issues.  During a late-June visit to Germany, Zarif made similar remarks, arguing that security cannot be “purchased.”  "When foreign policy becomes a commodity, then purchasing military equipment becomes your yardstick for measuring who is a terrorist or who isn't a terrorist," Zarif noted. "This reinforces a cognitive disorder in our region that security can be purchased from outside, that security can be purchased by trying to buy more military equipment," he pointed out.  Dissimilar to Wahhabism which is s a cornerstone of Saudi ruling legitimacy, Iran just held a massive presidential election in May as 42 million rushed to ballot boxes.  “Mr. Trump arrived in the region at the time when he saw 45 million Iranians participating in the elections,” Mr. Rouhani told a press conference two days after re-election.  “Then he visited a country that I doubt knows the definition of elections. The poor things have never seen a ballot box,” Rouhani said in open reference to Saudi Arabia.  PA/PA  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
