The Iranian Foreign ministry said in a statement that during the meeting, Amir Abdollahian outlined the Islamic republic’s principled policy toward the issue of Palestine as a plight in the heart of the Islamic ummah created by the child-killing Zionist regime which enjoys support from the West. He also condemned the brutal crimes of the Zionist occupiers against al-Quds, al-Aqsa Mosque, Gaza and occupied Palestinian territories as well as the regime’s aggression and atrocities against the Palestinian people and sanctities. Amir Abdollahian reaffirmed Iran’s support for the legitimate defense of the Palestinian people and resistance against the occupation of the Zionist regime.  Haniyeh, for his part, appreciated Iran’s support for the Palestinian people in their struggle against the Zionist regime’s continued aggression. He also called on the Muslim and Arab world as well as the international community to adopt a decisive stance against the Israeli regime’s violations. The meeting was part of Amir Abdollahian’s high-level meetings in Qatar, where he met with the emir and the foreign minister of the tiny Persian Gulf nation.  In his meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Amir Abdollahian extended the Iranian president’s greetings to the Qatari leader. He examined the latest developments in bilateral ties in political, security, trade and economic areas. Amir Abdollahian referred to the existing capacities for expanding economic relations between Iran and Qatar, underlining the need for forging cooperation in economic areas given the existing advantages of Iran in this regard.  The Iranian foreign minister further outlined the current Iranian administration’s approach to relations with neighboring countries and emphasized the exchange of delegations at high levels between the two countries for consultations.
