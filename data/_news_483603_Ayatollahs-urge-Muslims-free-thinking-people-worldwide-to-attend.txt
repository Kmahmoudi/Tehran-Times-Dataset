QOM, Iran - A number of grand ayatollahs have issued separate messages asking Muslims in the world, especially Iranians, to attend the Quds Day rallies. Quds Day is marked in the last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan. This year it falls on April 14. Ayatollah Javadi Amoli, who is considered a top religious scholar, said in such a day “we want the global community to care about the freedom and independence of countries and do not give the Zionism and its supporters a ‘free hand’ to repeat the ‘bitter experience’ of the first and second world wars.” The scholar added, “Countries cannot achieve freedom through killing. Humanity cannot achieve freedom through bloodshed and killing. Killing and massacre will not make human civilized.” Javadi Amoli suggested that participation in Quds Day rallies will help the “oppressed” and instead weaken the “oppressor.” Ayatollah Nouri Hamedani urged people to hold rallies to show their disgust of Israel as the occupier of the Palestinian lands and the United States and the chief backer of the Israeli regime. Ayatollah Jafar Sobhani said the purpose for naming the last Friday of Ramadan by Imam Khomeini is intended to encourage all Muslims across the world to hold rallies in support of the “oppressed Palestinians” and request the God to annihilate the usurper Zionist regime.  “The fasting and dear countrymen, along with other Islamic countries, are requested to participate in the Quds Day rallies and demonstrate the unity of the Islamic world,” Ayatollah Sobhani pointed out. Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi said on Quds Day Muslims as well as free-minded people across the world cry out the “trampled rights of the oppressed Palestinian people” whose lands have been stolen. It is for more than 60 years that Al-Quds Mosque as the first qibla of Muslims have been occupied and the “self-proclaimed defenders of human rights and democracy have closed their eyes to daily crimes of the Zionist regime and act just as onlookers,” he lamented.
