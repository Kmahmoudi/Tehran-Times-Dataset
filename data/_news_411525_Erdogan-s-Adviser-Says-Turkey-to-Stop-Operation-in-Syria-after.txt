TEHRAN - An adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that the country will end its operation in Syria only after capturing the city of Manbij. "Turkey is presently setting up a 90-kilometer buffer zone," he said. "Ankara is trying to regain its presence there," Ilnur Cevik said at a conference titled "Relations between Turkey and Russia: From the Period of Tension to Strengthening Cooperation" organized by the Sabah newspaper and the Press and Information Office of the Turkish government, TASS reported. "As soon Manbij is captured, Turkey will stop its operation in Syria," Cevik said. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu earlier said that it is necessary to clean the city of Manbij from terrorists and Kurdish militants of SDF.
