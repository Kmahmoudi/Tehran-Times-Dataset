TEHRAN – Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Monday that Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani will be serving as an inspiring example for the resistance front.
 During a meeting with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza in Tehran, Zarif also described Soleimani as a “remarkable” figure of resistance. General Soleimani was assassinated in a United States’ airstrike in Baghdad on January 3. He was a legendary commander in leading the resistance movement against terrorist groups, especially Daesh, in both Syria and Iraq.
