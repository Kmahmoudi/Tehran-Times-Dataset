TEHRAN â€“ Tehran Municipality has shut down eight business units due to generating dust and causing disturbance to local residents in southern parts of the city, Mehrdad Zanganehfar, deputy director for urban services and environment of Tehran Municipality, has said. In this regard, the Department of Environment has also issued warnings to 10 carwashes, two of which have been closed down and the rest have been mandated to use septic tanks [to collect their sewage and allow to decompose through bacterial activity before draining by means of a soakaway], he added. He finally explained that in case citizens spot any violations on the part of the business or industrial units, they can report the violation by calling 137 and leaving a voice message; the municipality would investigate the matter as soon as possible.
