TEHRAN – General Ramezan Sharif, the spokesman for the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), has warned Israel against any military action against Iran, asserting that any such move will lead to the destruction of the Zionist regime of Israel. General Sharif was responding to remarks by an Israeli military official that Israel alone can attack Iran.  “This statement of the Zionists is not a new statement and they have repeated that many times. But maybe it has a message and that message is that the conditions of the Americans in the region are such that they cannot support the Zionists,” the spokesman told Fars News.  He added, “In a sense, the Americans are trying not to throw themselves into the arms of the Zionists because they know that if the Zionists take action against us, our reciprocal measures will include bases supporting the Zionists.” General Sharif further said, “The main reason for such a statement by the Zionist regime can be seen as the message of the Americans to them that they are not able to support this regime as in the past and are not ready to enter into a battle that will determine where its fate will lead.” He warned, “The Zionists know that if they start a military operation or action against us, the end of this action is not with them and it will definitely accelerate their destruction.” Responding to a question on the publicization of differences between the U.S. and Israel and the statements of American officials in this regard, General Sharif said, “Perhaps this type of statement has such a consequence, the Zionists want to announce to the Americans that we no longer rely so much on your military power and we want to take action ourselves.” But such a statement by the Zionists, General Sharif said, is a political bluff.  On Friday, IRGC Chief Commander Hossein Salami said Israel is nearing its end. Addressing demonstrators in International Quds Day rallies in the central city of Isfahan, General Salami said the ultimate victory for Palestine is not distant, as every move made by the Zionist regime would drive it closer to collapse. The fall of the Zionist regime is pretty imminent, the commander stated, according to Tasnim. “The cause of liberation of al-Quds has become a clear and achievable reality,” the top military official added. General Salami enumerated the crises the Israeli regime is grappling with, saying while the foreign policy crisis is making the Zionist regime more isolated, the internal chaos and instability coupled with social protests and the Tel Aviv regime’s impotence have steered the regime towards irreversible decay.   “Today, the enigma of (how to ensure) security is becoming more complicated for the (Zionist) regime every day,” the general stated, adding that the Zionists come under attacks from Lebanon, Syria and the Gaza Strip, but are unable to respond and do not know who launches the strikes. On Friday, rallies were held in Iran and other parts of the world to mark Quds Day, which is marked on the last Friday of Ramadan.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
