TEHRAN-  Platform 14A of Iran’s South Pars gas field (in the Persian Gulf) was loaded at Bandar Abbas yard in south of the country on Tuesday.
 The platform is projected to be installed on its designated offshore spot on January 20-22, starting production in phase 14 of South Pars development plan, according to the Public Relations Department of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC), which is in charge of the gas field development. Phase 14 is expected to produce 56.6 million cubic meters of sour gas and 75,000 billion barrels of gas condensate per day, one million tons of liquefied gas and one million tons of ethane per year, and 400 tons a day of sulfur. The huge gas field, that Iran shares with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, covers an area of 9,700 square kilometers, 3,700 square kilometers of which, called South Pars, are in Iran’s territorial waters. The remaining 6,000 square kilometers, called North Dome, are situated in Qatar’s territorial waters. The field is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas, accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves, and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate.
