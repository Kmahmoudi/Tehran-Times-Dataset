TEHRAN – European Commission’s deputy director-general for mobility and transport said EU is going to continue its transport cooperation with Iran despite U.S. sanctions, IRNA reported on Monday. Speaking in a two-day workshop on ports, maritime and logistics held by Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization (PMO) in collaboration with the European Union in Tehran, Maja Bakran Marcich said “the EU will continue to cooperate with Iran in the framework of agreements signed in various fields of transportation.” The official noted that 80 percent of the world's trade is conducted through sea transport and since a big chunk of this trade is between Asia and Europe, it cannot be stopped under any circumstances. Mentioning the U.S. sanctions on Iran and its effect on transport, Bakran said “I am sure that there will be no problem between Iran and the EU despite U.S. sanctions and its restrictions on Iran.” During the workshop, PMO’s Managing Director, Mohammad Rastad presented Iran’s significant potentials and capabilities in maritime transportation areas to the audience. According to the official, the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) is among the world’s Top 100 shipping companies and IRISL currently accounts for 1.1 percent of the world’s total shipping capacity. “With 5,800 kilometers of sea borders, Iran currently has 230 million tons capacity of commodity transportation in northern and southern ports”, he said. Rastad further noted that over 300 million tons of crude oil and non-oil commodities were loaded and unloaded at Iran's ports during the last Iranian calendar year (March 2017- March 2018). Attended by representatives of the European Commission and high ranking officials from Iran’s transport sector, the Workshop on Ports, Maritime and Logistics kicked off on Monday in Tehran.
