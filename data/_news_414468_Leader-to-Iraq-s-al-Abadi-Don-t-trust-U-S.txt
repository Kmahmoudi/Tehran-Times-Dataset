TEHRAN – Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday told Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi not to trust the Americans because Washington and its allies are against the Iraqi unity and independence. “There is need to be vigilant in the face of Americans and not trust them at all because the U.S. and its stooges are against the sovereignty, identity and unity of Iraq,” the Leader remarked in a meeting in Tehran. The Iraqi prime minister arrived in Tehran on Tuesday afternoon directly from Riyadh, where held talks with top Saudi officials including King Salman. The Leader added, “The reason why Americans are against popular forces is that they want Iraq to lose its important cause of clout. “Don’t trust Americans at all because they are waiting for the opportunity to deliver their blow (to Iraq).”  Also, Ayatollah Khamenei advised the Iraqi prime minister against allowing the Americans enter Iraq under the guise of training Iraqi forces. “They (Americans) shouldn’t be given the opportunity, and American forces should not be allowed to enter Iraq under the pretext of training (Iraqi forces) or other issues.” The Leader further said there is no will by the U.S. and its allies to counter terrorists in the region. “Americans and its certain subservient countries in the region don’t aim to uproot Daesh (ISIS) because Daesh rose from their backing and money.” Ayatollah Khamenei also voiced his strong opposition to holding a referendum on the independence of the Iraqi Kurdistan. “The Islamic Republic of Iran as a neighbor is against certain remarks about holding a referendum on a portion of Iraq getting separated, and considers those who promote the issue as opponents of Iraq’s sovereignty and identity.” “With such historical, cultural, and humanitarian civilization, Iraq should remain united, and it’s the right of such country to stand on its feet and powerfully stand up to those who seek to confront it.” Ayatollah Khamenei added, “The Iraqi government should be reinforced from all directions, and it’s the duty of all political and religious currents in Iraq to support the incumbent government.” Al-Abadi, for his part, said Iraq needs the assistance of Iran in fighting Daesh and later in reconstructing the country. The Iraqi prime minister also held talks with President Rouhani and Vice President Es’haq Jahangiri.
