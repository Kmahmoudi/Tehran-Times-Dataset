TEHRAN - The Brexit has long been a complicated puzzle in the political and economic equations of Europe and London. The talks between London and Brussels over British exit from the European Union have been halted. On the other hand, we are witnessing widespread protests against the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union (protests raised in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Shortly before, whispers were heard that England wasn't to leave Europe at all. For example, Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, whom his country's government holds the rotating presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Union, mentioned that Brexit won't eventually take place!  Previously, former British Prime Minister Tony his country's withdrawal from the EU, stated that it's possible that Britain won't leave the EU! This is while according to a referendum held in 2016, the British citizens voted for leaving the EU. The European and British authorities seem to be designing a joint project to prevent the realization of Brexit. The British authorities are apparently insisting on the persuasion of the Brexit negotiations, while on the other hand, European officials hope that the decision of British citizens on leaving EU wouldn't come true! The British authorities' insistence and the denial of the European authorities are two big pieces of the same puzzle which its ultimate pictures Britain as part of the European Union. Although Brexit is quite complicated by nature, many of the complications that have been highlighted by British and European authorities are not real. Indeed, if Britain's withdrawal from the EU and the related negotiations were to fail, then what would be the position of the official and general referendum in which was held in England last year? Regarding the evidences, we come to conclude that the British and European authorities are preparing the public to change their decision to leave the EU. Well, it should not be forgotten that right now the conservatives are in power in England, and they have always been the main opponents of Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. The current British Prime Minister, Theresa May, tried her best to prevent the realization of Brexit at the time she served in David Cameron's cabinet. Meanwhile, the only proponent of Brexit was the former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who agreed with England's withdrawal from the EU. However, Johnson is no longer in his previous position.  In any case, we should expect fresh conflicts in the case of the British withdrawal from the European Union. These conflicts will take a more serious strike by the British public and, in particular, supporters of Brexit in the future Finally, we should say that the British citizen's vote was thwarted by the British and European leaders' decision. British citizens are now pursuing the official and informal positions of their authorities in this regard while they're utterly confused. Is Brexit really going to take place? Will the decision of British citizens be recognized in this regard? These are the unanswered questions that are in the minds of the supporters of Brexit.
