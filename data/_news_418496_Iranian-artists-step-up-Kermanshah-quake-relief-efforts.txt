TEHRAN – Iranian artists have announced that they would organize various programs to help the victims of the devastating earthquake that hit the western Iranian region of Kermanshah on Sunday.

 The powerful earthquake killed at least 450 people and injured thousands. The Kurdish band Tarang plans to perform a benefit concert in Tehran to aid the victims of the deadly earthquake. The concert will be held at Tehran’s Andishe Hall on November 24, bandleader Borzu Amiri said in a press release on Tuesday. “This is not the first time that the Kurdish people feel grief… However, I hope it will be the last time they feel sad,” he stated. Tehran’s Kurosh Cineplex also plans to help with relief efforts following the natural disaster. The cineplex will allocate half of its box office revenue on Wednesday to the victims.   Tehran’s Mojdeh Gallery also will organize a three-day exhibition to aid the quake-stricken people. The gallery is scheduled to put part of its treasure trove on sale during the exhibition to raise funds for the victims of the earthquake.  Gallery manager Mojdeh Tabatabai has also asked Iranian artists to join the charity by donating their artworks to the exhibition, which will open on November 24. Legendary Iranian Kurdish vocalist Shahram Nazeri also expressed his sympathy for the victims of the quake during the unveiling of his new album “Who Is a Lover?” in Tehran on Monday. The organizers observed a minute of silence before the unveiling ceremony in remembrance of those who perished in the earthquake.  The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has also stopped all art and cultural programs for three days to sympathize with those who have lost loved ones in the accident. In addition, the National Orchestra also canceled its Tuesday night concert to remember the victims of the earthquake as many celebrities sent messages of sympathy to the victims on social networks.
