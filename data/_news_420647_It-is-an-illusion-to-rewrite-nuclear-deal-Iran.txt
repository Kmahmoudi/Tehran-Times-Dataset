TEHRAN – Speaking about rewriting the 2015 nuclear deal due to a pressure by U.S. President Donald Trump is just an “illusion”, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said on Tuesday. Speaking with al-Alam TV, Shamkhani said Washington’s efforts to contest nuclear deal, also called the JCPOA, is an “illegal” move and that Iran will “never agree to renegotiation” of the agreement. The U.S. has shown flagrant disregard to the JCPOA and while Iran has been fully committed to the multilateral agreement, it has not been able to fully benefit from it, the top security official complained.
