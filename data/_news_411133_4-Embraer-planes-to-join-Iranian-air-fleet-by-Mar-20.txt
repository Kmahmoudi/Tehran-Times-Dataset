TEHRAN- Kish Airlines will add four Embraer 195 airplanes to its fleet by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017), the CEO of the Iranian airlines told Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. The new Brazilian Embraer aircrafts will meet the demand of 20 Iranian airports that want to get connected to the southern Iranian Kish Island, Mohammad-Taqi Jadidi said. These airplanes are about six to eight years old, he added. Iran is hoping to rapidly upgrade its fleet now that sanctions have been lifted under the 2015 nuclear accord, in which Tehran pledged to curb its nuclear program. Iranian Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi announced in mid-January that by March 20, two Airbus A330 jets will be delivered to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Akhoundi also added that Iran will receive nine Airbus 321 and 330 planes during the next Iranian year.
