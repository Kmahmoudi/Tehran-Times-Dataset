TEHRAN – Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Monday that using foreign messaging apps is a right of Iranian citizens, reassuring that the Rouhani administration is not seeking to block Telegram messaging app. “The administration’s stance on the internet and the use of messaging apps is crystal clear,” Nobakht said at a press conference, highlighting the importance of competition among domestic and foreign apps. He also said the Rouhani administration has taken supportive steps to improve domestic messaging apps but will not resort to blocking foreign apps to achieve that end, ISNA reported.
