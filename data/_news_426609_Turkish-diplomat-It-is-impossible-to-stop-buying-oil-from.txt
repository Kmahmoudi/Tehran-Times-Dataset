TEHRAN - Riza Hakan Tekin, Ankara’s ambassador to Tehran, has said that it is “impossible” for Turkey to stop purchasing Iran’s oil.
 Turkey imports half of its needed crude oil from Iran and “it is impossible to meet the U.S. demand on stopping purchasing Iran’s oil,” ISNA quoted him as saying in an interview with Anadolu Agency. He noted that sanctions should “conform to international law” and be “based on international consensus”. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the nuclear deal on May 8 and ordered restoration of sanctions against Iran. The first batch of sanctions was snapped back on August 6. The second batch, which will include banking and oil boycott, will be restored on November 4. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu issued a statement in June saying that Turkey does not have to act in compliance with “unilateral” U.S. decisions on Iran. Cavusoglu said on Thursday that Turkey is determined to expand ties with Iran despite the U.S. threats to punish governments that violate economic sanctions against Tehran. “Time and again we have made it clear that we will not implement U.S. sanctions against Iran,” Press TV quoted him as saying during a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s special envoy Mahmoud Vaezi in Ankara. Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said on Wednesday that Ankara will continue to buy gas from Iran. “We adopted the United Nations sanctions on Iran in the past. Even the European Union is extremely annoyed by today’s situation. We are conducting legitimate trade here, which is of great importance in terms of supply security,” he said. Iran is one of the biggest suppliers of natural gas and oil to Turkey, according to Press TV.
