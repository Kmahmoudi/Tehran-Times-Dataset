TEHRAN – Some six thousand Iraqi nationals apply for the Iranian visa per day, according to Iran’s consulate in the city of Basra. The Islamic Republic’s consulate general in Basra announced that 6,000 Iraqis apply for Iran visas every day in order to visit the country, and this figure is on the rise, public relations office of the consulate announced on Monday, ISNA reported. Back in March, Tehran and Baghdad agreed to mutually waive visa fees hoping to cement tourism, local economies and to bring their peoples closer.
