TEHRAN — Finland would be happy to transfer its experience and technology to Iran and take a share in addressing its environmental challenges, said Antti Kaikkonen, the Chairman of the Finnish Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs. Kaikkonen who had travelled to Tehran at the head of a delegation made the remarks during a meeting with the Chief of Iran’s Department of Environment (DoE), Masoumeh Ebtekar, the DoE reported on its website on Monday. “Iran and Finland are capable of boosting cooperation in various areas especially in the field of environment,” Kaikkonen noted. Finland has the potential to help Iran in the field of renewable energies and waste management, he said, adding “we can help Iran cut down on greenhouse emission and enhance energy efficiency.” “We are also ready to take practical steps towards implementation of the environmental agreement we have already signed with Iran,” he stated. Ebtekar, for her part, referred to climate change as one of the fields that the countries can focus on while insisting on transferring knowledge and technology from Finland to Iran. Emphasizing on Iran’s willingness to combine effort on international scale Ebtekar added that wetlands’ restoration and monitoring of weather, water, and soil quality are of the other areas of interest for Iran to focus on international level. “Of course protecting the biodiversity, developing and improving management of preserved areas, exchanging technology, promoting green economy, fighting air and soil pollution and global warming are already mentioned and agreed upon in the agreement signed with Finland,” Ebtekar added. All countries worldwide are interested in collaborating in tackling environmental challenges, she pointed, adding in fact such matters needs to be dealt with internationally.
