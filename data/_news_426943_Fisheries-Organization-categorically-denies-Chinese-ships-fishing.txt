TEHRAN — Over the past few weeks there has been a heated debate over claims that Chinese ships are fishing in Iran’s territorial waters. The claims have been categorically denied by Iran’s Fisheries Organization.
 There are claims about overfishing by Chinese vessels in Iran's southern waters which are said to have infuriated local fishermen whose livelihoods have been affected by the practice.  Traditional fishermen have no way to make a living other than fishing, but industrial ships disrupt local fishermen's economic status by catching small and big fish.  Shapour Kakoulaki, deputy director for fishing at the Fisheries Organization, said on Monday that there are some 91 fishing vessels in southern waters of Iran with 2,000 crews including 300 Chinese who work for Iranian ships. These fishing vessels are either purchased or are rented, Kakoulaki said, adding, “We are training Iranian workers to replace the 300 Chinese crews.”  He rejected claims that the organization has issued long-term licenses to Chinese fishermen to work in the Persian Gulf waters, saying that the vessels are not plying the Persian Gulf, rather they are across the Hormuz Strait and are only legally allowed to fish in depth of 200 meters. Kakoulaki also noted that two vessels are sent to the area to assess the condition of fish in the area and that hunting lantern fish will be banned from September 11 for a month.  While some claim that lantern fish population is in danger based on surveys conducted by the Fisheries Organization there are some 2.5 to 4 million lantern fish in the area, he added. “Fishermen are authorized to catch 300,000 tons of lantern fish. Last year (March 2017-March 2018) some 17,000 tons of lantern fish were caught,” he explained.  All vessels are being tracked with GPS and in case of violations their permits will be suspended.
