TEHRAN â€” The cabinet of ministers has allocated some 8.2 trillion rials (nearly $205 million) to Lake Urmia restoration projects, IRIB reported on Wednesday. Previously, three trillion rials (nearly $75 million) had been earmarked for projects to replace old irrigation systems and farming practices and prevent soil erosion, Tajrishi explained. Lake Urmia which used to be the largest lake in the Middle East and the sixth-largest saltwater lake on Earth with a surface area of approximately 5,200 square kilometers is facing a dramatic decline for some year now. Old and inefficient irrigation methods, depleting ground water resources within the lake watershed, long periods of drought, damming rivers which were supposed to flow into the lake and on top of that mismanagement and inappropriate measures intensified the lakes status over time. However recently with international helps the lake is rather gaining strength which may [or may not] last forever.
