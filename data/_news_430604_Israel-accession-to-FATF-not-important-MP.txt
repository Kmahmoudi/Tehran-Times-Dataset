TEHRAN – MP Alaeddin Boroujerdi said on Wednesday that the accession of Israel to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is not important for Iran, adding that the Zionist regime, whether it be a member of the FATF or not, makes every effort to pressure Iran. “Israel is an eternal enemy of the Islamic Iran and will spare no efforts in pressuring Iran, especially through America,” ISNA quoted Boroujerdi as saying. He added that despite the pressure, the Iranian parliament goes ahead with the passing of the FATF-related bills. On Monday, it was reported that Israel had been accepted as a member the FATF, which is dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorism financing.
