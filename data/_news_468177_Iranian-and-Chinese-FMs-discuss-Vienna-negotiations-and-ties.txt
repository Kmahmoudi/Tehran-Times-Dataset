Regarding the nuclear talks in Vienna, the top Chinese diplomat supported Iran's approach toward the negotiations given the positive actions and initiatives as well as good faith of the Islamic Republic.  Wang described the positive efforts of the Iranian side in the negotiation process as facilitating. The Chinese foreign minister also praised Iran's efforts to negotiate with some regional countries to clear up misunderstandings in the region, calling it a factor in stabilizing the region. In the end, Iran’s foreign minister described actions such as the AUKUS treaty (between Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom) as a sign of a severe weakening of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) through the application of double standards.
