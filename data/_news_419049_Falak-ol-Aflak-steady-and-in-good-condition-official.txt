TEHRAN – No physical threat poses Falak-ol-Aflak, a historical fortress in western Iran, as a wave of recent reports on social media hinted that the ancient brick structure has been partly hurt, a cultural heritage official said on Sunday. Also known as Falak-ol-Aflak Castle, the unmissable eight-towered monument dominates Khorramabad, the capital of Lorestan province. “Regarding scientific researches and technical inspections, the fortress is not confronting with a new problem and this valuable monument is in a state of sustainability,” said Farhad Azizi who presides over the office of World Heritage Affairs at the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization. “It stands pretty steady and is in good condition,” CTHN quoted him as saying. The official rejected reports on social networks about the destruction of Falak-ol-Aflak as baseless and non-technical. In the past couple of years ago, the historic castle was faced with lots of problems that resolved in close cooperation of provincial officials by the means of both essential and urgent repair projects, he explained. A tourist destination for domestic and foreign travelers, the fortress dates from the Sassanid era (224–651). It seems particularly imposing and dramatic when floodlit at night, offering picturesque views of its encircling crenellated battlements.
