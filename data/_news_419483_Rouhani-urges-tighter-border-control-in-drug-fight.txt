TEHRAN – President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday that patrols in border areas should be increased to counter drug trafficking.
 During a meeting of the Drug Control Headquarters, the president called for holding consultations with neighboring countries on campaign against drug trafficking. “We should use other countries’ successful experiences in countering drug trafficking and (drug) addiction,” he said. He attached great importance to the role of schools and universities in countering addiction. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said on December 3 that Tehran and Moscow have established “comprehensive cooperation” in fighting drug trafficking. “Iran, Russia and the regional countries have the right to be more sensitive about the issue of narcotics and should hold consultations on fighting drug trade,” he said.
