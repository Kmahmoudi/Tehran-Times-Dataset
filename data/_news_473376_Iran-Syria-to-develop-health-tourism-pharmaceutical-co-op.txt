TEHRAN – Iranian Health Minister Bahram Einollahi and Syrian Prime Minister Hussein Arnous discussed ways to expand bilateral cooperation in the fields of health tourism and pharmaceuticals. In a meeting on Monday, Einollahi welcomed the exchange of medical services and equipment by the two countries, referring to the memorandum of understanding signed in various fields. He called for the elimination of bureaucratic barriers to the activities of doctors and the exchange of medicines, referring to the provision of education for students of the two countries. Elsewhere in his remarks, Einollahi announced his readiness to hold a joint congress of Iranian and Syrian medical sciences. “As U.S. sanctions continued, the difficulty of COVID-19 control increased, however, we strived to handle it.” Arnous, for his part, said that there is a need to increase the exchange of medical research, especially now that there is ample opportunity for collaboration. A total of 227 knowledge-based firms are supplying medical equipment for health centers across the country. He further emphasized that Syria would support any agreement between the two countries to promote health. Sanctions for countries bring more solidarity and we must stay together, he further noted.

Today, all medicine used in the treatment of coronavirus are produced by domestic manufacturers, and if we wanted to import all the items, there would be a high exchange rate, he further stated, emphasizing that COVID-19 vaccine development indicates the pharmaceutical industry’s capability. In 2018, 67 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used to produce drugs in Iran were made locally. A total of 227 knowledge-based firms are supplying medical equipment for health centers across the country, according to the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology.
