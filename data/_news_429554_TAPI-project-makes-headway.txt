TEHRAN _ The TAPI pipeline project, designed to diversify Turkmenistan’s gas exports, could deliver its first gas to Pakistan in two years, the company’s chief executive officer (CEO) said on Tuesday. The pipeline is expected to link the energy-rich Central Asian nation of Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan and India, said a report by Reuters. Muhemmetmyrat Amanov, CEO of TAPI pipeline company, speaking at an industry conference in Abu Dhabi said the primary cost of the pipeline was $5 billion and the total cost was expected to be around $7 billion. “We are planning to make a final investment decision in the first half of next year and then stage by stage finalize construction in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India,” he said. Last week, a delegation of Turkmenistan government led by Deputy Prime Minister was on a working visit to Afghanistan during which they held extensive talks on TAPI project with the Afghan political leadership. The two sides exchanged views on key areas of cooperation and implementation of humanitarian and economic projects were also considered in accordance with the agreements reached earlier, said a report. The TAPI pipeline will run from Galkynysh – the largest gas field in Turkmenistan through the Afghan cities of Herat and Kandahar and finally reach the Fazilka settlement located near Indo-Pak border.
