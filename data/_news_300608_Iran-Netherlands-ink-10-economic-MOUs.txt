 The signed contracts seek to improve future bilateral cooperation in energy, finance, banking and insurance, as well as transportation, health and water management besides finalizing economic agreements and exchanging experiences and data in different fields. Reviewing the latest situation for economic cooperation in the joint meeting, Van den Berg referred to the existing investment opportunities and capacities in Iran and underlined expansion of bilateral cooperation.

Last November, Iran and Netherlands signed an MOU on bilateral cooperation in different agricultural areas. The agreement was penned by Iran’s Agriculture Minister Mahmoud Hojjati and the Netherlands’ Minister of Economic Affairs Henk Kamp in Tehran. In the ceremony for signing the MOU, Hojjati expressed hope that Iran’s nuclear deal with the world’s major powers will lead to the expansion of its trade ties with the Netherlands. A new chapter has opened in the political and economic ties between Iran and the Netherlands after Iran’s nuclear deal.
