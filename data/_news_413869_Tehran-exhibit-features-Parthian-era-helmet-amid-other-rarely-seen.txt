TEHRAN – A Parthian-era armory helmet along with a patchwork of other rarely-seen historical relics of the same period (247 BC–224 CE) are on show at the National Museum of Iran in downtown Tehran, ISNA reported. Arsacid dynasty that founded and ruled the Parthian empire controlled almost all the trade routes between Asia and the Greco-Roman world. Parthian wealth obtained through lucrative trade networks resulted in substantial patronage of the arts, in particular relief sculpture, statuary (large and small scale), architectural sculpture, metalwork, jewelry, and ceramics; coins with images of Parthian rulers form another important category of objects, according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The showcase will be running through June 17 and it is part of a larger event that features prehistoric tools, pottery vessels, metal objects, textile remains, and some rare books and coins dating back to the Paleolithic era to the end of Qajar period (1789–1925).
