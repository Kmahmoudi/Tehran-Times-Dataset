TEHRAN – Iranian President Ayatollah Ebrahim Raisi said that foreign troops stationed in West Asia should leave the region, warning Israel against any military action against Iran. Speaking at a parade in Tehran held on the occasion of Army Day, Raisi said foreign troops in the region are a threat to security and they did not ensure security of the regional nations.  In his speech, Raisi called belief in God, self-belief and belief in the people as important features of the Iranian Army, according to a readout by the official website of the Iranian presidency.  "Belief in God creates the idea of defending the people, homeland and preserving divine values as well as standing and resisting in our army," Raisi said. He noted, "The army of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a well-equipped and up-to-date army. The use of advanced equipment in the army is one of the clear manifestations of the ‘We Can’ slogan, which has made opportunities for ourselves and the country out of threats and sanctions.” Referring to the character of the army's credibility, Raisi said, "The army of the Islamic Republic of Iran loves the people, and whenever an incident occurs in the country, it sees itself as a servant by the side of the people, and the people also trust and love this army." He further described the army as a strong barrier against counter-revolutionaries, takfiri groups, and evildoers. "The army of the Islamic Republic of Iran protects the interests of the country and the people from guarding the borders of the country to the oceans, and the people also love the Army." Emphasizing that the presence of Iran’s armed forces is a security-building factor for the region, president Raisi said, "The message of the Army Day ceremony is a message of peace and friendship for the countries of the region, and our armed forces warmly shake any hand that wants to maintain security for the region today." He further said, "Extra-regional forces, especially American forces, should leave the region as soon as possible because they threaten the security of the region and have not and will not provide security for the nations of the region, but the presence of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran is security-building anywhere in this region." Raisi stated that today the power of Iran’s armed forces is not unknown to anyone, adding, "Our armed forces will not allow any force to create the slightest insecurity in the region, and the skies of the region and the Persian Gulf are always safer than ever thanks to the presence of our armed forces." Raisi went on to say that the army defended the country, the people, and the values of the Islamic Revolution.  48,000 army personnel were martyred and thousands more were wounded during the Sacred Defense in the 1980s, he stated. And today it has given peace and security to the people like a strong fortress, the president noted. He added, "The enemies of the Islamic Revolution, especially the Zionist Regime, have received the message of the power of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran that the slightest mistake against our country will be responded with a harsh response and will be accompanied by the destruction of Haifa and Tel Aviv." Raisi further clarified, "The nations of the region should also know that the message of the authority of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic will be hope and security for them, and that our valiant army will always provide them with comfort and peace." The president also addressed the families of the martyrs, saying, "If the blood of your martyrs has been able to protect the country against modern ignorance, our army and armed forces will always guard their pure blood and increase the dignity and authority of Islamic Iran." He also emphasized the importance of equipping the armed forces. "The government considers itself obliged to equip and support the armed forces and will try to solve their organizational and individual concerns."   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
