TEHRAN – Former Iranian nuclear negotiator Seyed Hossein Mousavian says Washington’s policy toward the Islamic republic is shaped in Tel Aviv not Washington, ISNA reported on Monday. Mousavian, a research scholar at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, made the remarks while addressing a special conference with leading U.S. policymakers and nuclear security analysts at Ploughshares Fund. Mousavian said Donald Trump’s policies showed that Washington places no value on its signature. Despite repeated confirmations by the UN nuclear watchdog that Iran is abiding by its commitments under the nuclear agreement, Trump, in a speech on October 13, refused to certify Iran’s nuclear compliance.
