He added, “The IRGC Navy, especially in recent years, has achieved extraordinary capabilities and achievements, and what we are witnessing today is part of the IRGC's power and might at sea.” During his visit, the IRGC commander inspected the IRGC bases and assets on the island, saying that the Basij forces stationed on the Abu Musa island are at the forefront of defending Iran. Addressing these forces, General Salami said, “Today, You are at the forefront of defending the country in the Abu Musa island.
