TEHRAN – The number of Iranian arrivals in Serbia has increased over the past six months since the country allowed visa-free entry for visitors from Ira Some 7,000 Iranians have visited Serbia since last September when the European country abolished visa requirements for Iranians, Mehr quoted Belgrade’s Ambassador to Tehran Dragan Todorovic, as saying on Tuesday. People in Serbia and Iran have common morals, Todorovic said, adding, tourists going to Serbia will be guests of the Serbian people … because the two nations are friends. I am sure that tourism will help the two countries boost cultural and economic sectors, the envoy added. After a gap of 27 years, direct flights between Iran and Serbia resumed on March 11, when an Iran Air jet touched down at Belgrade’s Nikola Tesla airport. Iran Air is offering a direct service between Tehran and Belgrade twice weekly, with all flights fully booked until the end of the summer. A second Iranian carrier, Qeshm Air, is also planning to launch a service between the two capitals starting from March 19, AFP reported. Last August, Maja Gojkovic, the president of the National Assembly of Serbia, said she would put to vote in parliament lifting visa restrictions for Iranian travelers. She made the remarks in a meeting with Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani in Tehran.
