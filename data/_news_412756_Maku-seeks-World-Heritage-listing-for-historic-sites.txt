TEHRAN – Maku, a northwestern Iranian city teemed with abundant historical places and natural beauties, keeps an eye on possible inscription of its sites on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2021. Earlier this month, Maku Free Trade Zone Organization secured a memorandum of understanding with the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization to safeguard the historical and cultural features of the region. A key article in the MOU obliges the sides to make arrangements and prepare a dossier in a bid to inscribe “Maku cultural landscape” on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Maku is a picturesque city in West Azarbaijan Province. The Saint Thaddeus Monastery on the outskirts of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage list.
