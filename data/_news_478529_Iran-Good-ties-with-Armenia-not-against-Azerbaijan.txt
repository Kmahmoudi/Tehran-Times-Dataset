TEHRAN- Nasser Kanaani, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, stated on Tuesday night that dialogue between regional capitals rather than “trans-regional” involvement is the best way to address disputes in the Caucasus region. "Iran once again announces its readiness to contribute to resolving the remaining issues between its northern neighbors (the Republic of Azerbaijan and Armenia) in the framework of bilateral, trilateral, and six-sided regional frameworks," Kanaani said in response to the Azeri president’s remarks on Iran's good relations with Armenia. Kanaani further stated that Iran's core diplomacy is founded on good neighborly relations and the growth of cordial connections with all its neighbors, as well as building relationship with each neighbor, but this does not imply exploiting such ties against another neighbor. “Our core policy has been premised on good neighborliness and development of relations with all neighbors and that consolidation of relations with each of the neighbors is not against another neighbor,” he clarified.  "The Islamic Republic of Iran has always emphasized the need to safeguard the territorial integrity of every country, and peaceful resolution of the disputes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and therefore, we had condemned the occupation of Azerbaijan's territories and supported their liberation at the highest political level," the Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated in reference to Iran's fundamental policy regarding the ongoing conflict between its two northern neighbors in the Karabakh region. He added the Republic of Azerbaijan has been in contact with officials from Armenia for nearly two years at various political, military, and security levels, paving the way for peace and friendship.  All of this has been supported by Iran, but “we are unable to understand why they are concerned about our normal interactions on a neighborly level with that nation (Armenia),” Kanaani pointed out. Kanaani also said Iran’s recent wargame near borders with Armenia and Azerbaijan was a routine and pre-planned action that had previously been communicated to the neighbors through official channels.
