TEHRAN - Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said on Sunday that Iran will respond if the U.S. Congress violates the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Iran’s parliament inspects the U.S. Congress’s moves on the JCPOA and will respond at the right time if the deal is violated, he said during a meeting in Tehran with Richard Howitt, a member of the European Parliament. Elsewhere, Boroujerdi said that terrorism poses threat against the whole world’s security. An international determination is required to fight the terrorist groups, he added. He said that military and financial supports for the terrorists in Syria by some regional countries have fueled the tension in the region. Boroujerdi said that inter-Syrian dialogue is the only way to settle the Syrian conflict. The senior lawmaker added the Syrian people should determine their destiny. He also highlighted the importance of talks between Iran and the European Parliament on various issues. For his part, Howitt said the nuclear agreement between Iran and the 5+1 group (the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany) has opened a new chapter in relations between Iran and the European Union. He also praised Iran’s efforts in fighting terrorism. The nuclear deal between Iran and the major powers took effect in January 2016.
