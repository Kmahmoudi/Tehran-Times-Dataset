TEHRAN – Like every year, Pir-e Shaliar, a legendary figure for Iranian Kurds, was warmly remembered during a vast ceremony held in Uraman Takht rural district. Flocks of people from all walks of life attended the three-day event which commenced from January 31 in western Kordestan province. Narratives say that Pir-e Shaliar had magical healing qualities and a mojo power to populate the land with livestock and crops in times of trouble. He is associated with the pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian times.  The legend says that Pir-e Shaliar magically cured ‘Shah-Bahar Khatoun’ the beloved daughter of king of Bukhara so that he was rewarded with getting married with the girl. Participants from neighboring villages and areas usually make their way through the snow to Uraman Takht where festivities and prayers to God continue over a few days.  The festival usually starts before dawn with children distributing walnuts as gifts, knocking on the villagers’ doors and getting sweets from them in return. Sheep and goats are slaughtered as the day breaks. Then several hours are spent for cooking a special soup called ‘Veloshin’; meanwhile people celebrate the event by blessings and prayers. The soup will be ultimately distributed amongst all villagers.  People come out from their terraced houses, which roof of one is courtyard of another, to witness the ritual. Daf, a local drum, is played and the dervishes of the region gather to chant and dance, while swaying their long hair through the air. Prior to the night, men meet in the house of Pir-e Shaliar and continue their ritual of chanting prayers and playing the dafs to pay their ultimate tribute to the legendary figure of the region.(PHOTO: Seyyed Mosleh Pir-Khazranian/IRNA) AFM/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
