TEHRAN - Yahya Rahim Safavi, a top military adviser to the Leader, said on Sunday that the Syria Army and government should follow political solution to the conflict gripping their country while continuing their military campaigns against militants.
 “The Syrian Army and the axis of resistance should continue their successful operations, however, in my opinion, the Syria Army and Mr. Bashar al-Assad’s government should follow political solution along with armed jihad,” Safavi suggested. The former IRGC chief noted that the U.S., European Union, Zionist regime, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Turkey provoked the war in Syria in order to undermine the country’s independence, national identity, and territorial integrity but they failed. Elsewhere, he said that the U.S. follows “policy of force” which has failed in West Asia. Rahim Safavi added, “You can hardly find a region as important as West Asia from geopolitical, geoeconomic and geostrategic aspects. This region is place of geostrategic rivalry for international and regional powers and Syria is an example of this rivalry.” NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
