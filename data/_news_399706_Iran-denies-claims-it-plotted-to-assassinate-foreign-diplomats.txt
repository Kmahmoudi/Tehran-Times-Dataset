NEW YORK - Ali Reza Miryousefi, the head of the press office of the mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations, has dismissed claims that Iran had plotted to assassinate a number of foreign diplomats.
	 
	The Washington Post reported on May 28 that Iran-linked operatives had planned to kill foreign diplomats in at least seven countries over a span of 13 months and that the targets had included two Saudi officials, a half-dozen Israelis, and several Americans.
	 
	Miryousefi, in a press release published in English on Tuesday, wrote, “The Islamic Republic of Iran has been a victim of vicious acts of terrorism that have resulted in the assassination of thousands of innocent Iranians, including ordinary people, officials, and scientists. The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly condemned all acts of terrorism. These latest baseless allegations are clearly the manifestations of Iran-phobic propaganda in order to increase the illegal pressures on Iran. These allegations coincide with rumors regarding the delisting of the MEK terrorist (group) from the U.S. terror list. In turn, this raises the question of who really supports terrorism.” All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
