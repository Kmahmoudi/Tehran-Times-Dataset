TEHRAN - Former Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan has said that Qaher, a state-of-the-art stealth fighter jet produced at home, has entered pre-flight test phase which is technically called “fast taxi” phase.
 “One of the tests is to check if the plane is able to move on the runway which is called taxi test and after this phase the plane should be able to move fast and get ready to take off which is called taxi test. In both phases, the plane’s points of strength and weakness are revealed… The Qaher fighter has gone through the fast taxi phase,” he told Tasnim news agency in an interview published on Saturday. The fighter jet Qaher-313 was unveiled in February 2013. The single-seat stealth fighter jet can take off and land on short runways, according to Tasnim. Elsewhere in his interview, Dehqan said continuation of instability and insecurity in the Middle East region is a “fundamental strategy” pursued by the United States. He noted that the U.S. has changed its policy to proxy wars which are being conducted by countries such as Saudi Arabia and terrorist groups. He also said that the U.S. formed a coalition against Daesh, but it actually provided the the terrorist group with financial and arms supports. “The Islamic Republic of Iran warned the regional and extra-regional governments that Daesh was a threat against international security when the terrorist group was formed. However, no country took practical actions in fighting Daesh except for Iran,” he said. NA/PA
