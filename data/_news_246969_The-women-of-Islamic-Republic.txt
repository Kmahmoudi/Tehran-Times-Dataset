Behind every great man stands a greater woman, as goes the famous saying. If I may humbly add, behind every great nation stands a great mountain of innovative, resilient and collaborative men and women. When I visited the 28th Tehran International Book Fair, this exact attitude seemed to have taken a firm grip of the new generation of publishers and exhibitors working there. However, as Ms. Maryam Zamani from the Institute of Ghadirshenasi remarks, this phenomenon is not simply limited to one industry; it is an industrious and success-driven approach shared across the cities and towns of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
