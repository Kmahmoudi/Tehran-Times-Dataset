TEHRAN – The Republican leader of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee said President Trump should not walk away from the Iran nuclear deal, Reuters reported. Texas Congressman Mac Thornberry said on Fox News on Sunday it would be a mistake for Trump to scuttle the nuclear accord reached with Tehran. “I would counsel against it,” he said. “I thought it was a bad deal,” he said. “But the key question is, ok, what happens next if the U.S. pulls out? Does Iran kick out those inspectors so we lose the visibility we have?” MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
