TEHRAN — Iranian ranger, Ahmad Bahri, on his Instagram has called for volunteer people to help save the wildlife, Mehr news agency reported. Bahri’s call has been welcomed very well. “It’s been a year that I get massages on my Instagram page from people who would like to somehow help promote the environment by helping the wildlife in various ways voluntarily,” Bahri explained. Therefore, he said, “I decided to get the idea to the next level by asking the people publicly to take part in this act of protecting environment voluntarily.” In what Bahri himself calls “Nazr-e Tabiat” (meaning doing something charitable to help save and protect the environment) people can make their contributions to the environment by either giving away money to construct watering places and buying hays for feeding the animals or by taking care of wounded animals until the recover and can return to the wild once again. “Some vets treat injured animals for free and there are even lawyer who have expressed readiness to bring environment related lawsuits to the court free of charge,” he highlighted. “We also had an offer from a guy who suggested to write environmental massages on the walls,” he highlighted. Some believe that mostly farmers are those who participate in this charitable act of protecting the environment but almost all people nationwide are joining it, he said, adding, but people from provinces of Yazd, Isfahan, and Hormozgan are more active than other provinces. “We are also doing our part by distributing posters and brochures promoting ‘Nazr-e Tabiat’ among the people specially those living the vicinity of the protected areas,” he noted.
