TEHRAN – Domestic managers should take the risk of indigenizing the aerospace industry, the vice president for science and technology has said. Sourena Sattari said that for indigenizing the aerospace industry international standards should be met, ILNA reported on Monday. Iranian experts and scholars active in the field of aerospace should take part in the industry, he said, adding that by signing contracts the vice presidency for science and technology supports the aerospace companies. “However, the private sector should accept responsibilities to offer service and high quality products,” Sattari explained. Iran will establish a national aerospace market in the near future to introduce aerospace industry products, services, technologies and software. In late May, the head of the headquarters for knowledge aerospace technologies at the vice presidency for science and technology Manouchehr Manteqi said that Iran plans to establish a national aerospace market in the near future to introduce aerospace industry products, services, technologies and software.  The market aims to support knowledge enterprises active in the field of aerospace industry and develop market for demanded products, he explained. Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth (aeronautics) and surrounding space (astronautics). Aerospace organizations research, design, manufacture, operate, or maintain aircraft or spacecraft.  Aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces aircraft, guided missiles, space vehicles, aircraft engines, propulsion units, and related parts.  SB/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
