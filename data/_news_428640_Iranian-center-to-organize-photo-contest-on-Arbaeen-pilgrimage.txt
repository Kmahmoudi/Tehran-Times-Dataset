TEHRAN – Al-Ummah, a satellite institute of Iran’s Study Center of the Islamic Revolution Cultural Front, plans to organize a photography contest on the Arbaeen pilgrimage this year. “Iran and Iraq Cannot Be Separated” is the main theme of the competition, the center announced on Tuesday and asked photographers to send their photos to the institute until November 21. The competition aims to neutralize the videos and other materials published on the social networks to damage the friendly relations between Iranian and Iraqi people, the organizers said. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians have embarked on a journey to the Iraqi city of Karbala to observe the holy day of Arbaeen at the holy shrines of Imam Hussein (AS), the third Imam of the Shia, and his brother, Hazrat Abbas (AS).        Arbaeen, which will be observed on October 30 this year, marks the end of the 40-day mourning period following the martyrdom of the Imam and his loyal companions on Ashura.
