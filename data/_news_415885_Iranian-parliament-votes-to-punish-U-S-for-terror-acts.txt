TEHRAN – On Sunday, the Iranian Parliament voted overwhelmingly for a bill to punish the United States for its terrorist activities and adventurism. Of the 247 MPs present in the 290-seat parliament, 240 voted in favor of the bill.   The parliamentary bill was first adopted by the Parliament National Security and Foreign Policy Committee. The bill came after the U.S. Congress in July adopted a legislation against Iran for its defensive missile program, alleged human rights violations, and what they called Iran’s “destabilizing” role in the region.
