TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Velayati, the senior foreign policy advisor to the Leader, said on Tuesday that cooperation between Iran and Russia has prevented a further spread of terrorism in West Asia.
 In a televised interview, he also said regional situation entails “strategic” relationship between Iran and Russia. “Strategic relations in defense area have been established and the sale of S-300 defense system and advanced planes are examples,” the veteran politician explained. Commenting on nuclear cooperation with Russia, he said Moscow has been providing Iran with peaceful nuclear technology to produce electricity, a reference to the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant and a plan to build two more nuclear facilities at the site. Velayati says it is Iran, Russia, China and India which will determine the future of Asia.
Velayati also said it is Iran, Russia, China and India which will determine the future of Asia. -----‘Iran will respond if ISA is enforced’ In a press conference on Tuesday, Velayati also said an implementation of the Iran Sanctions Act violates the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the official name for the nuclear deal.  He said Iran will respond if the ISA is enforced. The ISA was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran’s energy industry. The extension was passed unanimously on Thursday by Senate. The ISA was first approved by the House of Representatives. Velayati also said that Tehran Security Conference is scheduled to be held on December 11. ------‘De Mistura was seeking to partition Syria’------ Velayati also said UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura sought to disintegrate Syria which was refused by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Velayati said de Mitsura was more representing the United States rather than the United Nations. “De Mitsura’s view was that a local governing council be established in eastern Aleppo and this meant the partition of Syria which Beshar Assad did not accept.” Velayati also said there is no doubt that the Syrian city of Aleppo will be liberated from the hands of terrorists sooner or later.
