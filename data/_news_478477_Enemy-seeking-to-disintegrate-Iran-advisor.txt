TEHRAN – A senior Iranian official has said that the enemy seeks to disintegrate Iran through its media outlets.  Mohammad Dehghan, advisor to the Iranian president on legal affairs, said the recent developments in Iran were “beyond protest” and that the enemy seeks to use the unrest to disintegrate Iran. “The recent incidents in the country have been beyond protest and as was admitted by a Pahlavi regime official, the enemy, using everything in its power, especially the media, is seeking to disintegrate Iran through regime change,” Dehghan was quoted as saying on Tuesday by IRNA.  The presidential advisor also said that Iran’s law apparatus is paying attention to this matter and has a duty to explain it.  Iran has been grappling with a weeks-long wave of unrest that erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini. Iranian authorities have said in unison that the enemies want to exploit the unrest to disintegrate Iran along ethnic and religious lines. Iran’s Deputy Interior Minister for Security and Police Affairs, Majid Mir-Ahmadi, has said that the U.S., Israel and their allies are running the riot operations room in the country, Fars News reported.  Mir-Ahmadi averred that in the recent riots, the war room and the leadership of the scene were in the hands of America, the Zionist regime and their allies. “Enemies target the security and stability of the country and make it unsafe. It doesn't matter to them whether this insecurity is for a woman who wears a headscarf or has little adherence to the veil, or a Shiite or a Sunni person,” he said. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said on Saturday that the recent unrest was a Plan B pursued by the United States but failed to implement it. Speaking to reporters, Amir Abdollahian said, “What our nation has seen over the last 40 days was the implementation of the very Plan B that the Americans wanted to pursue. But they failed in this regard due to the nation’s intuition and the guidance of the Supreme Leader.” In an early October speech, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said that the United States and Israel exploited the death of Mahsa Amini to stage riots in Iran and if this incident had not taken place, they would have found another pretext to do what they did.  “These riots were planned. These riots had been planned. If the incident with the young girl had not taken place, they would have found another excuse to create insecurity and riots in the country at the beginning of the month of Mehr (September) this year. Who designed these plans? I openly state that these schemes were designed by the US, the usurping, fake, Zionist regime, and their mercenaries. They sat down and planned. They devised these schemes. Their employees, mercenaries, wage earners, and some treasonous Iranians abroad helped them,” the Leader said. Also, Iran’s intelligence agencies have said that the U.S. and its allies are behind the unrest in Iran.
