Addressing a group of Basij (volunteer) forces, he said the bullying powers have realized that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a power to reckon with in the region. The Islamic Republic of Iran has brought security not only for itself but also for the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, the Caucasus, and the Central Asia, he added. The Islamic Republic of Iran has become a regional power, thanks to the unity enjoyed by its nation and government and the wise leadership of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, the IRGC commander stressed. He further said that the U.S., European states, the Zionist regime and certain Arab countries are threatened by Iran's successes and are trying to prevent it from becoming a regional power in political, economic, and military terms. Iran's power to defend the region's peace and security, its vast energy resources and geo-political situation indisputably makes it a regional power, he added.
