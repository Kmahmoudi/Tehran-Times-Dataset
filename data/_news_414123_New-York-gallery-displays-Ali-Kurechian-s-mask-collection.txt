TEHRAN – Iranian sculptor Ali Kurechian is displaying a collection of his masks inspired by Persian alphabets in an exhibition underway at the Elga Wimmer Gallery in New York. Entitled “For Your Eyes Solely", the exhibit features a number of masks with three-dimensional representations of poetry and mysticism. “The reason why I have chosen the notion of the mask is that I was inspired by the equivocal phrases and lines of Persian poetry, which I took to mean that the truth about the world has been disguised,” the artist has said about his masks. “However, coming to use these mask-like volumes to convey the connotation and rhythm of what the Persian poets are trying to insinuate via the elements of these masks is the product of their shape,” he remarked. “This particular show in NY urges the viewer to think of masks as the veil between truth and reality, the way mystic poets such as Rumi use layers of meaning to allude to what lies beneath words,” art dealer company Sotheby’s has written about the exhibit. Masud Nader and Roya Khadjavi are the curators of the exhibit, which opened on May 31 and will be running until June 11. Tehran’s Saless Gallery hosted the exhibit in January.
