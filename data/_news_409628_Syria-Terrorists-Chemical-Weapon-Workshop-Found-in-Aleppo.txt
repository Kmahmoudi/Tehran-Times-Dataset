Official Envoy of Syria for implementation of the agreement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Samer Abbas presented a series of documents to the representatives of the International Committee of the OPCW, proving that terrorists used Mustard Gas in Syria. Based on Abbas remarks, the representatives of the OPCW were due to form a special committee to investigate the use of chemical weapons by terrorists, "but they have not done anything in this regard yet".
