TEHRAN – Iran opened Friday a consulate in the southern Armenian city of Kapan nearly a year after expressing interest in doing so. Videos circulating on social media showed a building decorated with balloons and Iranian and Armenian flags being readied for an official opening. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian on Thursday afternoon left Tehran for Armenia’s capital Yerevan at the head of a political and parliamentary delegation upon an invitation by his Armenian counterpart Ararat Mirzoyian. Earlier, the Iranian Foreign Ministry had said Amir Abdollahian will attend a ceremony to inaugurate Iran’s consulate general in the town of Kapan. In early October, Amir Abdollahian commented on Iran’s recent move to open a consulate in southern Armenia, saying the consulate is intended to bolster Iran-Armenia relations. In remarks to ICANA, Amir Abdollahian considered the establishment and start of activities of the first Consul General of Iran in Kapan in line with the view of the Raisi administration on economic issues and with the aim of strengthening the North-South transit route and expanding and deepening the relations between Iran and Armenia. “This move, which will help strengthen the North-South transit route, was carried out with the aim of developing and strengthening cooperation between the two countries, especially in the economic field, and the Iranian Consulate has started its activities in Kapan,” Amir Abdollahian said. He added, “We will witness the ever-increasing expansion and deepening of relations between Iran and Armenia with the establishment of the first consulate in Kapan.”    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
