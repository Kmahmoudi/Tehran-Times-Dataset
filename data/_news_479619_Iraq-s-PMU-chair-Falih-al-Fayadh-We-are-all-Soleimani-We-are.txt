TEHRAN – On the fifth anniversary of victory over Daesh (ISIS), Iraq's Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) chair Falih al-Fayadh said defeat of terrorism is an honor for future generations. The winners of this victory are the martyrs, especially martyrs who commanded the fight against Daesh, al-Fayadh stated. “We announce the season of martyrdom. Martyr commanders are a thorn in the flesh of foes. In defending this country, we are all Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. We are all Qassem Soleimani,” the PMU president stated. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy chairman of the PMU, and Iranian anti-terror hero Lt. Gen. Qassem Soleimani were martyred in a U.S. assassination attack in early January 2020 near Baghdad’s international airport.
