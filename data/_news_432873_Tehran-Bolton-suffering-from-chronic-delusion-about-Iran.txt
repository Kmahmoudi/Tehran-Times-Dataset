TEHRAN – Tehran says U.S. national security advisor John Bolton is suffering from a “chronic delusion” regarding Iran and Iranians. Speaking with IRNA on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said Monday’s celebrations of the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution made Bolton realize that his desires and pipe dreams about Iran will never come true. Bolton said earlier that “after 40 years, the Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to fulfill its promises to uphold and safeguard the rights of its citizens. The 40th anniversary of the Iranian regime only serves to highlight four decades of failure and broken promises.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
