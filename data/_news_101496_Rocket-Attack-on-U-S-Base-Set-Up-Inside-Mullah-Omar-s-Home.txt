The rocket was fired on Friday evening and landed several meters behind the compound in the southern Afghan city, causing only minor damage, AFP reported. Provincial security official Mohammad Salim Ehsas said the rocket was fired from the village of Qasam Pul, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Kandahar. He said three people had been arrested and that sympathizers of the former Taliban fundamentalist regime were suspected of carrying out the attack. Some 19 months after the toppling of the Taliban, a 11,500-strong U.S.-led coalition continues to hunt the militia and its allies, mainly in southern and eastern regions bordering Pakistan.
