TEHRAN – An Exhibition of hand-woven Persian carpets, rugs, and kilims by Iranian tribes and nomads including Bakhtiari, Qashqai, and Shahsavan is currently underway at Tehran’s Qasr Garden Museum.  In addition, the exhibit showcases a variety of lavishly designed floorings by countrywide urban craftspeople who are native to Kerman, Qom, Tabriz, Tehran, Hamedan, Shiraz, Gorgan, and Mashhad. Organized in close collaboration with the Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization, the event will come to an end on December 9. Amongst principal characteristics that tribal and urban Persian carpets have in common are distinctly floral designs, representing leaves, buds and flowers along with a tendency to naturalistic drawings with graceful and often intricate lines sketched through vivid natural colors. The museum is located on Motahhari St., Police Square. AFM/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
