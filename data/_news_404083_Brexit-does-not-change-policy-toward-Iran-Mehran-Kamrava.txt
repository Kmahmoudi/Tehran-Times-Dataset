TEHRAN - Mehran Kamrava, a professor of the Middle East Studies in Georgetown University of Doha, says the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union will not necessarily affect London’s policy toward “the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and Iran”.

 “I don't think Britain's exit from the EU will necessarily result in changes to its policies with the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and Iran,” Kamrava tells the Tehran Times. Following is the text of the interview: Q: What will be the effect of Brexit on British relations with the Middle East, especially the Persian Gulf region? A: I don't think Britain's exit from the EU will necessarily result in changes to its policies with the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and Iran. There are two issues to keep in mind. First, although Britain may be exiting from the EU, its foreign policy objectives and interests are still likely to be similar to those of the EU and also the U.S., and therefore there is unlikely to be any noticeable changes to British foreign policy in general and toward our region in particular. Secondly, most of Britain’s policies in regards to the Persian Gulf is driven by economic interests, and these economic interests in terms of investments by British companies in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and Iran are unlikely to change. If anything, Britain will have a freer hand in international investments now that some EU restrictions and regulations are likely to be lifted, and so the UK may pursue international investments more aggressively. “Most of Britain’s policies in regards to the Persian Gulf is driven by economic interests, and these economic interests in terms of investments by British companies in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and Iran are unlikely to change.” Q: Will Brexit have any effect on British relations with Iran? A: Please keep in mind that these are all speculations at this point. Until it actually happens, no one knows quite how Britain's withdrawal from the EU will impact its domestic economy and its foreign policy in the short and long terms. Also, the actual exit of Britain from the EU is not going to happen for at least several months, perhaps a year or so. Prime Minister David Cameron has announced his resignation and has called for elections in October. That means at the earliest there will be a new prime minister in London in October. No matter how different in perspective and policy from Cameron, the new prime minister will not be able to put into immediate effect policies that are radically different from Cameron's. So we are not likely to see any immediate changes to British foreign policy for at least several months. PA/PA
