The bill has been thoroughly reviewed by the Guardian Council, said Kadkhodaei, adding that there are numerous problems within the bill which the parliament has been informed about. He further said the problems are mostly mistakes in translation. MH/PA   All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
