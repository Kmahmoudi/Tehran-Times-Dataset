TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has purchased the necessary equipment to conduct cloud seeding operations as part of a program to fight drought, the IRGC’s representative for parliamentary affairs has said. Mohammad Saleh Jokar said that the IRGC is ready to help cloud seeding in order to resolve the water crisis, ISNA reported on Monday. “Although the government has not asked for Sepah’s help, we have announced our readiness to help the government if necessary,” he said. Weeks ago, the IRGC Aerospace Force said it would mobilize all equipment to help the government.
