TEHRAN – As per a memorandum of understanding signed between the Ministry of Defense and the Department of Environment, the ministry is tasked to provide rangers with appropriate personal armors. The commander of Iran’s environment protection unit explained that other equipment including ballistic vests, stun guns, pepper spray, handcuffs and leg cuffs will be given to the rangers.   The equipment, comprising some 1,300 items, are produced with proper international standards and the first delivery will be made during next two weeks, YJC quoted Jamshid Mohammadkhani as saying on Monday. Counting to 2850 individuals, protectors of Iran’s environment have long suffered from lack of support, especially in terms of equipment. For instance, in June 2016 Mohammad Dehqani and Parviz Hormozi were killed during an armed conflict with poachers in Hormozgan province while a simple ballistic vest could have saved their lives.
