TEHRAN- Iran’s annual exports to Germany has witnessed a 35-percent growth in 2017, according to the vice chairman of Iran-Germany Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In an interview with ILNA, Amir Alizadeh also announced that Germany’s exports to Iran rose 15 percent in the past year. He put the value of trade between the two countries at €3.3 billion, of which €3 billion is Germany’s exports to Iran and €300 million is Iran’s exports to the European country. Iran’s trade with the European partners has increased noticeably after the implementation of its nuclear deal (known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) in January 2016. According to official data, EU trade with Iran has more than tripled from the pre-deal low of €6.2 billion in 2013 to almost €21 billion last year, Financial Times reported on Friday.
