Based on the data released in February, by the Parliament Research Center, the country’s economic growth will reach 4.6 percent by the current yearend. Unemployment inches down Iran’s unemployment rate in autumn 2017, which corresponds to the third quarter of the Iranian calendar year, stood at 11.9 percent, down 0.4 percent compared to autumn 2016, the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) announced.  The jobless rate showed 0.2 percent increase, in comparison with the figure in summer. Single-digit inflation rate  The CBI announced that the inflation rate for the 12-month period ended on the last day of the 11th Iranian calendar month Bahman (February 19) hit 9.9 percent compared to the same period in the previous year. It is while the SCI put the inflation rate for the 12-month period at 8.3 percent.

The country’s crude oil sales reached 402.4 trillion rials (about $9 billion) in the mentioned time span while the figure stood at 270.4 trillion rials (about $6 billion) in the preceding year, the report said. Foreign trade notches up The value of Iran’s non-oil trade with foreign partners reached $80 billion during the first 10 months of the year ended on January 20, up 12 percent from the same period last year.
