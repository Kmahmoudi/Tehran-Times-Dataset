TEHRAN – Iran’s presidential chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi has said that Iran and Canada had started no talks on resuming relations that the Canadian parliament decided to stop it.
 “No talk was even started to be stopped,” Young Journalists Club quoted him as saying on Sunday. He noted, “A number of signals for holding talks have been exchanged which do not mean resuming talks and relations.” The Canadian House of Commons voted on Tuesday in favor of a motion, calling on the government to “abandon its current plan and immediately cease any and all negotiations or discussions” to restore diplomatic relations with Iran. The measure also accused Tehran of “sponsorship of terrorism around the world” and enlisted Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps as a “listed terrorist entity” under the Canadian Criminal Code. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday that Canada has “misconceptions and illusions” about Iran. “These polices will be to Canada’s detriment and will not serve international peace and security,” Press TV quoted Zarif as saying. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi also said that Canada’s motion and its “final approval will undoubtedly be a strategic and major mistake entailing destructive consequences.” Canada cut diplomatic relations with Iran in 2012.
