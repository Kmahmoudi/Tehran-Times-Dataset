TEHRAN – Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan said Khatam-ol-Anbia Air Defense Base has received the first delivery of S300. Dehaqan let slip the news on the sidelines of an exhibition showcasing the latest advances of Khatam-ol-Anbia Air Defense Base, Tasnim reported on Tuesday.
Khatam-ol-Anbia Air Defense Base which controls Iran’s air-based defense, is the fourth branch of the Iranian Army, which until recently had ground, air, and navy divisions.
Iran showed off parts of the defense system during National Army Day on April 17.
The Russian predator will boost Tehran’s air defense capability dramatically as it is one of the most advanced systems of its kind that can engage multiple aircraft and ballistic missiles around 150 km away.
Dehqan also noted that a home-grown air defense system named Bavar 373 (Belief) will be unveiled this year with capabilities similar to those of S300.
The sale of the S-300, originally concluded in 2007, was repeatedly delayed due to the West’s pressure on Russia.
In 2010, Dmitry Medvedev, then the Russian president, canceled the deal, citing UN sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.
In addition to the UN arm embargo, the U.S. and Israel heavily lobbied Russia to block delivering the system to Iran, saying it could be used to shield Iran's nuclear facilities from possible future air strikes.
Angry by Moscow’s lack of commitment to the pact, Iran sued Russia in the International Court of Arbitration, asking for $950 million of compensation for the contract cancelled by Russia arms export agency Rosoboronexport.
Later on, the two sides buried the hatchet in 2015 as Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree lifting a ban on the delivery of the S-300 systems to Iran.
Since that time, there were conflicting reports as to when Iran would actually receive the system. AK/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
