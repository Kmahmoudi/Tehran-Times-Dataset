Prominent Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has censured US President-elect Donald Trump over his "escalating statements against Islam and Muslims," calling on him to refrain from engaging in "new gambles with blood and war." "Even if the US president changed, the hostile policies against the world will not change,” Sadr said in a statement on Thursday, stressing that Washington’s approach toward the Middle East and Iraq will not alter no matter who the president and vice president are, and which political party is running the US administration. The prominent 43-year-old Shia cleric also criticized Trump for not distinguishing between radical and moderate Muslims. Sadr then urged the US president-elect “not to throw himself into new gambles in the world of politics as the results would be nothing other than losses, blood and warfare -- something which would only prolong America’s woes especially at the time it is going through a financial distress.” Moreover, the Iraqi clergyman asked the American nation “not to be affected by the radicalism of their president," warning that they would otherwise "suffer from the international isolation because of the reckless policies which is unacceptable to every mind and every religion." Sadr signed his statement with “Peace be on the American people,” noting, “You have to know that Israel will remain our first enemy.” US President-elect Donald Trump meets with US President Barack Obama (unseen) during an update on transition planning in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington DC, the United States, on November 10, 2016.

The New York businessman has so far garnered 290 electoral votes, while his heavily favored rival and the former secretary of state received 232 votes despite winning the popular vote. Thousands of people rallied in cities across the US on Wednesday to protest against Trump's presidential election victory, condemning his controversial campaign rhetoric against Muslims, immigrants, women and other groups.
