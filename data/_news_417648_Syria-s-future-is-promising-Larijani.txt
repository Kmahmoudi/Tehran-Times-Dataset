TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Monday that the future of Syria is “promising” and the crisis in the country will be settled.
 “Syria resisted and paid a high cost for that, however, the country achieved a ‘good capital’ and has passed a five years crisis. The future of Syria is promising,” he said during a meeting with Speaker of the People’s Council of Syria Hammouda Sabbagh in Saint Petersburg. He also highlighted the importance of stabilizing Syria. Larijani also condemned Israel and Saudis’ role in causing crises in the Middle East region. For his part, Sabbagh praised Iran’s supports for Syria. He also condemned Trump’s Friday speech against Iran. The U.S. only seeks to protect Israel’s interests in the region, the top Syrian lawmaker noted. Trump decertified the nuclear deal and used harsh language against Iran as part of his new Iran strategy officially declared on Friday. Trump threatened to “terminate” the JCPOA if he could not “reach a solution working with Congress and our allies” to change it.
