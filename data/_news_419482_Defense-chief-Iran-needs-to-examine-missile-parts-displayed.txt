TEHRAN –Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Monday that Iran should be given a piece of the missile fired last month at an airport in Riyadh by Yemeni Houthi rebels to do its own investigation.
 Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to UN, on Thursday presented the debris of a missile at a military base in Washington in which she claimed was made by Iran and fired at King Khalid International Airport on November 4. “Enemies of the Islamic Republic can claim many things, but following Iran’s complaint, a debris of the missile should be given to Iran to examine it and announce its final analysis about it,” Hatami said. The defense chief also echoed a statement by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif that Iran will soon file a complaint to the UN Security Council against the U.S. for claiming that Iran has supplied missiles to Houthi rebels. In a tweet on Friday, Zarif said, “While Iran has been calling for ceasefire, aid and dialogue in Yemen from day 1, U.S. has sold weapons enabling its allies to kill civilians and impose famine. No amount of alternative facts or alternative evidence covers up U.S. complicity in war crimes.” Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference on Saturday, Zarif called the missile show “a piece of metal” and said the accusations by Haley were “unfounded”. The UN has said that its own investigation about the origin of missiles fired at Saudi Arabia remained inconclusive.  NA/PA
