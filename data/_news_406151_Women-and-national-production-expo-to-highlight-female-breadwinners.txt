TEHRAN — The 9th women and national production exposition will bring together some 70 major Iranian producers, the director of Tehran Municipality’s female breadwinners empowerment committee has said. Opening on September 8, the exposition will last until September 16 in Goftogu Park, northern Tehran, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fahimeh Firouzfar said, IRIB reported on Monday. 50 percent of the stalls are set up by children of female breadwinners, she added. All the goods available in this exposition are domestically produced and there will be inspectors in the exposition who would check up on that, Firouzfar noted. The goods which will be sold at the exposition are at much more reasonable prices than stores, she highlighted, adding, 22 stalls are allocated to women’s wear, 12 to children’s wear, 23 to men’s wear, two to hijab wears, one to leather items, three to handicrafts and three to jewelries. Carrying the slogan “Iran, building up self-belief” the producers have very well received the exposition last year as they made some 7 billion rials (nearly $200,000) over the 10-day event.
