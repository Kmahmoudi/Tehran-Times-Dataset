TEHRAN - The president of the Algerian Football Federation (FAF), Kheïreddine Zetchi, said he has not contacted Iran current coach Carlos Queiroz. The Portuguese has been reportedly a nominee to replace Rabah Madjer. The Algerian football federation parted company with Madjer in early July following a poor run of results that saw the national team lose to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Cape Verde and Portugal in their last four friendlies. "We are negotiating with two coaches. The name of the future coach will be announced in early August,” Zetchi said. “personally, I did not contact Carlos Queiroz and I don’t know who has contacted him,” the FAF president added. Former Japan coach Vahid Halilhodzic and Morocco head coach Herve Renard are reportedly candidates to take charge of Algerian football team.
