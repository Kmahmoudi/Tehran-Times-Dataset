TEHRAN – U.S. authorities have torn up the “warp and woof” of the nuclear deal, Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday in response to the U.S. government’s claim that Iran has not been in compliance with the “spirit” of the accord. “Iran has acted wisely regarding the nuclear issue,” Larijani said, adding the country would restore its nuclear program to pre-deal era in case the deal fails. Iran and six world powers signed the nuclear deal, officially known as the JCPOA, on July 14, 2015. It went into force on January 16, 2016.
