Scrolling through the Instagram, the vibrant colors of handicrafts and the innocent face of little girls in Baluchi dresses makes you to pause and open photos on @banook page. “We, a group of girls and young people at Saydbar Jadgal village in Baluchestan decide to develop and improve educational and medical situation of our place by selling our handicrafts [on this page],” one can read on the top of the @banook.doch Instagram account in Persian language.  Saydbar Jadgal is located 120 km from Chabahar port in the most southeastern part of Iran in Sistan and Baluchestan province. Needlwork is one of the most precious and interesting handicrafts created by Baluchi women in Iran. They are mainly used to embellish women’s clothes, however, the girls and women at Saydbar offer these fantastic works on bracelets, necklace, bags and scarfs. They offer the handicraft with reasonable price, which is a great motivation for visitors to buy them. Each piece of handicraft has a local name, which is mentioned with its Persian meaning. The idea of initiating an Instagram account was proposed by the Iran-e Man, a campaign launched by the private sector three years ago, focusing on building schools in deprived areas and holding programs toward sustainable development of such regions.  “A group of ten young men and 50 girls and women are working to provide handicrafts,” facilitator of sustainable rural development and member of Iran-e Man campaign Mina Kamran said in an interview with the Tehran Times. About 20 to 30 percent of the sale is set for a budget to improve educational and medical facilities for the village, she explained. “All the decisions and activities are made by themselves and Iran-e Man only provide facilitation for them,” she explained. Needlwork is one of the most precious and interesting handicrafts created by Baluchi women in Iran.

Kamran pointed to cooperation between men and women as an important factor to improve rural sustainable development. “Fortunately the men in Saydbar Jadgal do their best to improve the business and help women to do their best,” she explained. In future months, they are going to improve their works by asking women and men from other villages to offer their works on their Instagram account, she said. As the first step, they have decided to buy waste bins for their village by their budget, Kamran said.  Iran-e Man does not aim to give financial support to deprived area but to help them to think creative and have opportunity to implement their ideas, she stressed. A collection of their artworks will go on display during an exhibition in Tehran from March 12 to 15. The showcase can be found on No.3, Vahdatimanesh dead end, Kheradmand Jonoobi st., off Karimkhan blvd.
