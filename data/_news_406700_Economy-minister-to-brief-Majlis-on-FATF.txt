TEHRAN – Iran’s minister of economy is going to address the Majlis over the government’s voluntary cooperation with the Financial Action Task Force. Majlis Presiding Board member Akbar Ranjbarzadeh told the IRIB on Saturday that Ali Tayyebnia has requested to be given a time to speak to the lawmakers about the FATF. “Majlis will provide the minister with the opportunity, but it is to be decided by the presiding board how the report can be delivered,” the MP said.
