TEHRAN – The Iranian Armed Forces are fully prepared and strong enough to confront any military threat, according to Armed Forces Deputy Chief Ataollah Salehi. Speaking with IRNA on Tuesday, Salehi said the sanctions against the Islamic Republic have had no impact on the country’s defensive power and the enemies are well aware of Iran’s deterrent capability.  On stealth visits to Iraq by American officials, the general said the American officials’ visits to their bases in Iraq are taking place secretly while the Iranian officials visit Iraq for Arbaeen rituals in the most powerful manner.
