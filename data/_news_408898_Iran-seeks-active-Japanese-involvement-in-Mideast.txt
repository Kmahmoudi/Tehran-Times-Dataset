TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday that Japan should play a more active role in helping establish peace in the Middle East region.
 “We expect Japan to play active role in establishing stability in the region and use its political connections and contacts with other actors in the region and encourage them to stop supporting terrorists,” Zarif said during a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. Zarif said Iran is ready to cooperate with Japan to help stabilize the region. He added, “There exists a readiness for trilateral and multilateral cooperation in line with restoring stability and economic progress in Afghanistan.” Iran’s chief diplomat also said Tehran is willing to expand relations with Japan in various spheres, especially in economic and banking areas. For his part, Kishida said Japan supports a full implementation of the nuclear deal which was signed between Iran and the 5+1 group in July 2015. The nuclear deal known, as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action went, into effect in January. Kishida also called on Iran to play a more active part in helping promote international peace. NA/PA
