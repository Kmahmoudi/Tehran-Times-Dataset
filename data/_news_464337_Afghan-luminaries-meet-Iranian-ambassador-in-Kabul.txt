TEHRAN — Afghanistan’s former president Hamid Karzai and former peace negotiator Abdullah Abdullah have met with Iran’s ambassador in Kabul on Wednesday morning for talks on ways to restore stability to the war-torn country, following the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban takeover of Kabul.
 According to reports, Iranian Ambassador Bahador Aminian and the senior Afghan figures discussed the need to end the power vacuum in Afghanistan and form a system based on the will of the Afghan people, which would enjoy national and international legitimacy. The Taliban on Tuesday included Karzai and Abdullah in a 12-member council which will govern Afghanistan during the transition period, according to a source. Out of the 12 members, seven candidates have been already agreed upon, Asian News International (ANI) quoted a source close to senior Taliban circles as saying, citing Sputnik. “Afghanistan would be governed by a 12-member council, with the exception of the president and the emirate. So far, the council has agreed on Abdul Ghani Baradar, Mullah Yaqub, Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Hamid Karzai, Hanif Atmar and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,” the source said. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Monday that different Afghan groups should see the U.S. withdrawal as a turning point and work together to establish an inclusive government.
