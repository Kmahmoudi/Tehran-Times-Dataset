2012 Olympic gold medalist and three-time world champion Jordan Burroughs who received a surprise present after he withdrew from last weekend's Freestyle World Cup in order to be with his wife while she gave birth to their new daughter, Ora thanked Iran wrestling federation on his official twitter account. The gift was Termeh, a hand-woven cloth that originates from Iran, and it came from the Iranian Wrestling Federation as a way to honor Ora's birth.
Jordan BURROUGHS (USA) and Hassan YAZDANI CHARATI (IRI) were set to collide at last week's Freestyle World Cup. But when Burroughs' wife Lauren gave birth to their daughter, the 2012 Olympic champion chose to miss the competition to be with his family.
In response, the Iranian Wrestling Federation sent Burroughs a Termeh -- a Persian gift meant to welcome the birth of his daughter. A gesture seen by Burroughs (and wrestling fans around the world) as incredibly kind and befitting the two nation's unique wrestling connection.
The United States and Iran were two of the countries competing at the Freestyle World Cup. They faced each other in a dual during the qualifying stage, with the meet resulting in four wins apiece for both countries. In Burroughs' absence, Iran's Hassan Yazdani was able to earn a victory by technical fall over American Alex Dieringer in the dual's 74kg match.
With the meet tied, Iran ultimately ended up taking the victory over the U.S. via a tiebreaker (classification points) and advanced to the final. Iran then went on to beat Russia to earn their fifth straight Freestyle World Cup title, while the United States lost to Georgia in the third-place dual.
