TEHRAN – Oscar-winning director Asghar Farhadi’s acclaimed movie “The Salesman” is among the five contenders for the Oscar in the best foreign-language film category at the 89th Academy Awards, the academy announced on Tuesday. “Land of Mine” from Denmark, “A Man Called Ove” from Sweden, “Tanna” from Australia, and “Toni Erdmann” from Germany are other nominees in this category. A Memento production, “The Salesman” is about Emad and Rana who move into a new flat in the center of Tehran. An incident linked to the previous tenant dramatically changes the young couple’s life. The film brought Farhadi the award for best screenplay and the Palme d’Or for best actor for Shahab Hosseini at the 69th Cannes Film Festival last year.   Farhdi’s “A Separation”, a drama about a breakup, won Iran its first and only ever Oscar in 2012. The 89th Academy Awards will be announced the winners in the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood & Highland Center on February 26.
