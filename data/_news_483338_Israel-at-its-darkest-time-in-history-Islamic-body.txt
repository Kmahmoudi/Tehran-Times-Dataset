TEHRAN- The World Assembly of Islamic Awakening has harshly denounced the assassination of two military advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) in an Israeli bombing near Damascus, noting that the Tel Aviv regime is at its darkest moment in its history. In a statement issued on Monday, the assembly said that the Israeli regime is on the verge of collapse and has reached a point of weakness and desperation from which it was only a matter of time until it falls. In addition, it stated that the regime “continues to support terrorism in West Asia while violating international law and norms in an effort to polarize Muslims.” “But they should understand that such heinous and shameful deeds won’t affect the Muslim world’s solidarity and that their assaults and acts of hostility will not go unpunished,” it added. It went on to say, “The child-killing and occupying Israeli regime is currently going through its darkest period in history and is more isolated internationally than ever.” “The Muslim world must take tougher and more decisive stands in condemning the acts and crimes of this cancerous tumor since the true and terrible nature of this criminal regime has now been revealed to global nations,” it underlined. The Israeli regime is unquestionably drawing closer to its end, and the process has been sped up by its criminal behavior, egregious human rights violations, stoking unrest and conflict, and targeted killings of Muslims. Countries members to the Axis of Resistance and the entire Muslim world were ultimately urged by the International Assembly of Islamic Awakening to remain united against Israel’s plots and courageously combat terrorism by this regime.
