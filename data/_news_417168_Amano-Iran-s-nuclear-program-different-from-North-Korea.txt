Yukiya Amano, chief of the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency, said on Tuesday that Iran’s nuclear program is different from situation in North Korea, noting “in the JCPOA’s case, diplomacy worked”.
 In an interview with Reuters, he said that Iran is implementing its nuclear commitments under the deal. He said complementary access - often consisting of short-notice inspections carried out under the IAEA Additional Protocol, which Iran is implementing under the accord - is going smoothly. “Complementary access in Iran is being undertaken without problem and the number of accesses is quite high,” he said. During his speech at the UN General Assembly last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that he may not recertify the agreement when it comes up for review by a mid-October deadline, in which case the U.S. Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the accord. The nuclear deal was reached in July 2015 and went into effect in January 2016. Except the U.S. under Donald Trump, all other signatories to the nuclear deal – France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China and the European Union - have been insisting on the full implementation of the multilateral agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231.
