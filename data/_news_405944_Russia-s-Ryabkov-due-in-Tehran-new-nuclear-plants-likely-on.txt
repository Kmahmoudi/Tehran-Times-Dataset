TEHRAN – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov will be visiting Tehran on Wednesday, the Russian ambassador to Tehran said, days after Atomic Energy Organization of Iran spokesman Behrooz Kamalvandi said President Rouhani had approved the funding of two nuclear power plants planned to be built by Russia.  The Russian diplomat, who led the Russian negotiation team during nearly two years of negotiation over Tehran’s nuclear deal, will sit down with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi.
“Mr. Ryabkov will exchange views with his counterpart Abbas Araqchi during the visit,” said Russian ambassador to Tehran Levan Dzhagaryan on Tuesday. 
The two will most likely discuss a date for starting the construction of the two power plants President Rouhani had referred to. 
“In the coming weeks we will try to hold the final talks and then soon after announce a date for starting the construction of the power plants,” Kamalvandi said on Sunday. “Mr. Ryabkov will exchange views with his counterpart Abbas Araqchi during the visit,” Russian ambassador to Tehran Levan Dzhagaryan said.  One more possible theme is a deal under which Moscow will purchase heavy water from Iran with related talks nearing final stages. 
“The talks to sell heavy water to Russia are almost in thier final stages,” Kamalvandi was quoted by ISNA as saying. 
Under the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, including the U.S. and Russia, there will be no additional heavy water reactors or accumulation of heavy water in Iran for 15 years and all excess heavy water will be made available for export to the international market.
Iran’s heavy water needs are estimated to be 130 tons of nuclear grade heavy water annually. 
In the event of finalizing an agreement, Russia will be the second country after the U.S. importing the product from Iran. 
Closer relations between Moscow and Tehran in the nuclear sector will add more of a strategic quality to their ties, particularly after Iran allowed the Russian air force to conduct airstrikes in Syria against terrorist strongholds.  AK/NA/SP
