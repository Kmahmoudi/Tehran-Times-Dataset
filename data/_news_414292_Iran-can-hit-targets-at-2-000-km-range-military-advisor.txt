TEHRAN – A top military advisor to the Leader has said that Iran’s missiles are capable of hitting targets within a 2,000-kilometer range, ISNA reported. “In the event that America wages a war against Iran, all of that country’s military bases in the region will be in danger, as Iran is capable of hitting targets with its missiles within a range of 2,000 kilometers,” Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi said on Wednesday. Tension between Tehran and Washington has escalated since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who follows a confrontational policy toward the Islamic Republic.  Rahim Safavi noted though the U.S. military is present all over the world, it cannot hide the fact that its power is vanishing. This, he said, is manifested in their inability to put an end to the Syrian conflict and impose their own will on the Damascus government. Tehran and Washington back different sides of the conflict in Syria, with Tehran supporting the legal central government and Washington backing the so-called rebels who try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Elsewhere, the former IRGC chief condemned last week’s terrorist attacks that targeted Iran's parliament and the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Revolution. The attacks were later claimed by Daesh (ISIS). Rahim Safavi said Daesh is a by-product of Wahhabism which considers Shia Muslims as “infidels”. After the terrorist attacks, Trump blamed Iran for the incident, arguing that the countries which sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote. The comments sparked an immediate backlash from Iran. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif denounced them as “repugnant”, saying Iranians were countering “terror backed by U.S. clients”.  MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
