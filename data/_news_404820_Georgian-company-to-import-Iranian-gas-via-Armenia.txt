TEHRAN – The National Iranian Gas Exports Company (NIGEC) signed an interim agreement with the privately-owned Georgian International Energy Corporation for the export of 40 million cubic meters of gas to Georgia in a four-month period through Armenian territories, the managing director of NIGEC said on Sunday. The accorded contract is a short-term one which will be put into operation after receiving the required permits from Armenia, Shana news agency quoted NIGEC managing director Alireza Kameli as saying. After a meeting with Armenian Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Levon Yolyan last week, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said that an Armenian delegation made a trip to Iran following Tehran’s request for gas transit to Georgia. He further explained that Iran signed an agreement with a Georgian purchaser for tentative gas deal and hopes to start exports of its gas to that country via Armenia. Meanwhile, Georgia’s Deputy Energy Minister, Mariam Valishvili, told Trend that the ministry has no information on the conclusion of contracts for the import of Iranian gas to the country. “Theoretically, private companies can sign such a contract,” she said. “The Georgian legislation does not forbid it. However, these contracts must be submitted to the Georgian government for registration.”
