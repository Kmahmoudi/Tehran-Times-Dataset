TEHRAN – The speaker of the Majlis (parliament) stressed on Sunday that Iran will not succumb to pressure by the Trump administration and that the nation will preserve its dignity.

 “We appear to have entered a new stage whose essence is that the opposite side is assuming it can dictate its irrational and domineering will upon the nation,” Ali Larijani told an open session of the parliament. “This is where they should be made to understand that the Iranian nation is patient and welcome cooperation, but will not barter its dignity.” He stressed that Iran’s national pride does not let Iranians “to submit to American domineerism and overlook their future technological advancement.” “The important issue is that although [the Americans] have imagined the theory of pressure and economic austerity for our nation, our nation can turn this period into one of internal rebuilding of national economy by being vigilant.” Praising Iran’s past policy to engage in diplomatic talks with the West, Larijani said, “The important thing is that the country's officials have made their best efforts even by negotiating with the enemy to improve the country’s situation, especially in the economic sphere.” He added, “Since the withdrawal of the U.S., the EU has repeatedly asked that Iran condone its legal right to act in kind and not quit the nuclear deal. And they promised to create mechanisms to provide Iran with the benefits of the nuclear deal. Again, for the second time, the country's officials did not dismiss that request. The reason for that was to prevent economic situation becoming difficult for people.” The senior lawmaker, who once served as chief nuclear negotiator, said, “Judging from the entire course of action, one issue is sure: that the Islamic Republic system, walking on the path to nuclear technological advancement, used all methods to remove misunderstandings and resolve the issue in a way that people are not economically pressed. And this path will still be pursued.” SP/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
