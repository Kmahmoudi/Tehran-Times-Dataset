Many argue that it is an imperialist war for conquest and control of vast oil reserves, but that does not seem to be the case. The realpolitik of the 21st century is far more sophisticated than the colonialism of the 19th century. Political analysts compare the occupation of Iraq to the Vietnam War. They are correct to make the comparison, but mostly for the wrong reasons. The U.S. military and government lost the Vietnam War. Yet, it is said that some elements in the United States won the Vietnam War. How can that be? The U.S. military-industrial complex earned billions and billions of dollars during the Vietnam War. This was the main objective of the major stockholders, and they didn’t care who won the war on the ground. Now it seems that history is repeating itself, since the U.S. military-industrial complex is earning billions from the war in Iraq, with U.S. taxpayers footing the bill. “No blood for oil” is the slogan of the peace activists, but this war is not about oil. The extraction of oil requires engineers and oil workers. The occupying forces have used over 500 tons of depleted uranium munitions in Iraq. On impact, a certain percentage of the DU fragments into dust, meaning thousands of kilos of uranium dust are blowing in the wind in Iraq, contaminating the people, the land, waterways, and crops and leaving large sections of the country an irradiated wasteland. Very few engineers and oil workers will want to work in such an environment, so how can the war be about oil? Yet, the so-called peace activists keep up the chorus about blood for oil. They do not realize they are being manipulated by forces that seek to neutralize the peace movement. During the Vietnam War, peace activists were tricked into believing the peace movement was a one-issue struggle. Thus, when the war finally ended, most of them thought they had won, since their one issue had been resolved. One day, the U.S. troops and their allies will leave Iraq, and most of the peace activists will retire from the struggle, just like an earlier generation of peace activists did after the Vietnam War, if all goes according to the evil plan. The U.S. military-industrial complex will have made their billions, and those who sought to damage the gene pool of the Iraqi nation will also have attained their goal. In addition, those who sought to neutralize the peace movement will have realized their objective. However, there are still some things that peace activists can do now to prevent this bleak scenario from unfolding. Many U.S. soldiers who served in Iraq have contracted Persian Gulf War Syndrome, a mysterious illness with no known cause, but which is probably caused by exposure to the uranium dust from DU weapons. If a common struggle were to be established uniting the victims of depleted uranium munitions in the East and the West, maybe something could be accomplished. An Iraqi citizen could very well say to a U.S. soldier: “GI Joe, don’t you get it? Wipe that uranium dust out of your eyes and take a good look at what’s happening. The same people who are killing us, are killing you, too.” The military-industrial complex killing machine is basically a money-making machine. Therefore, it should be sued for damages. And there could be very many plaintiffs. At the height of the DU bombing, higher levels of radioactivity were even recorded in Britain. Radiation detectors at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) in Aldermaston and four other stations recorded a fourfold increase in uranium levels in the atmosphere within a few weeks after the attack on Iraq began in March 2003. Furthermore, some physicians have put forth the theory that the worldwide rise in diabetes over the past few years is due to the use of depleted uranium weapons on battlefields across the globe, since the wind carried the uranium dust all over the planet. Governments responsible for war crimes like the use of DU weapons and the targeting of civilians should be tried at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Charges should be filed against government officials and executives of the military-industrial complex involved in these war crimes at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Corporations that produce depleted uranium and other weapons of mass destruction that have been used against civilians should be sued for damages in national courts that have jurisdiction. This won’t bring back the people who have been killed or cure the people affected by DU weapons or maimed, but it would be an effort to put the military-industrial complex killing machine out of business, which is what the peace activists say they are trying to do in the first place.

Thus, when the war finally ended, most of them thought they had won, since their one issue had been resolved. One day, the U.S. troops and their allies will leave Iraq, and most of the peace activists will retire from the struggle, just like an earlier generation of peace activists did after the Vietnam War, if all goes according to the evil plan. The U.S. military-industrial complex will have made their billions, and those who sought to damage the gene pool of the Iraqi nation will also have attained their goal. In addition, those who sought to neutralize the peace movement will have realized their objective. However, there are still some things that peace activists can do now to prevent this bleak scenario from unfolding. Many U.S. soldiers who served in Iraq have contracted Persian Gulf War Syndrome, a mysterious illness with no known cause, but which is probably caused by exposure to the uranium dust from DU weapons. If a common struggle were to be established uniting the victims of depleted uranium munitions in the East and the West, maybe something could be accomplished. An Iraqi citizen could very well say to a U.S. soldier: “GI Joe, don’t you get it? Wipe that uranium dust out of your eyes and take a good look at what’s happening. The same people who are killing us, are killing you, too.” The military-industrial complex killing machine is basically a money-making machine. Therefore, it should be sued for damages. And there could be very many plaintiffs. At the height of the DU bombing, higher levels of radioactivity were even recorded in Britain. Radiation detectors at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) in Aldermaston and four other stations recorded a fourfold increase in uranium levels in the atmosphere within a few weeks after the attack on Iraq began in March 2003. Furthermore, some physicians have put forth the theory that the worldwide rise in diabetes over the past few years is due to the use of depleted uranium weapons on battlefields across the globe, since the wind carried the uranium dust all over the planet. Governments responsible for war crimes like the use of DU weapons and the targeting of civilians should be tried at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Charges should be filed against government officials and executives of the military-industrial complex involved in these war crimes at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Corporations that produce depleted uranium and other weapons of mass destruction that have been used against civilians should be sued for damages in national courts that have jurisdiction. This won’t bring back the people who have been killed or cure the people affected by DU weapons or maimed, but it would be an effort to put the military-industrial complex killing machine out of business, which is what the peace activists say they are trying to do in the first place.
                  Yet, the so-called peace activists keep up the chorus about blood for oil. They do not realize they are being manipulated by forces that seek to neutralize the peace movement. During the Vietnam War, peace activists were tricked into believing the peace movement was a one-issue struggle. Thus, when the war finally ended, most of them thought they had won, since their one issue had been resolved.
