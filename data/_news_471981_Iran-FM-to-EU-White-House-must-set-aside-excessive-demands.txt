Amir Abdollahian appreciated the tireless efforts of Borrell and his deputy Enrique Mora for revitalizing the JCPOA, emphasizing that “now diplomacy is working properly”. Borrell also referred to the positive will of the Iranian side in the Vienna talks, saying, “We believe that Iran wants an agreement and that there have been various initiatives which still exist and continue.” The EU foreign policy chief added that the protraction of the break in the talks “is not constructive” and suggested that talks between EU coordinator Mora and Iran's chief negotiator be resumed shortly.
