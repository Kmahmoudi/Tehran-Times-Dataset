TEHRAN – Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezaee has tacitly backed presidential candidate Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf who has said he will create 5 million jobs if he is elected president.

 “Creating 5 million jobs is doable and the country can be run by one who manages time,” Rezaee wrote in a tweet on Tuesday. Also in a second tweet, Rezaee reiterated his previous statement by saying, “Time is the biggest asset.” He then added, “The 100,000-toman ($24) subsidies is feasible, especially if it helps create jobs.” SP/PA
