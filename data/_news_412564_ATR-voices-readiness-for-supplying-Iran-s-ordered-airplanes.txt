TEHRAN- ATR is proud of assisting Iran with revamping its air fleet via supplying its required airplanes, IRNA quoted Patrick de Castelbajac, the CEO of ATR, as saying on Wednesday.  The CEO of Franco-Italian turboprop maker added that developing aerial transportation and boosting Iran’s regional status is a matter of importance to ATR.
Iran’s national flag-carrier airline Iran Air has signed a contract to buy 20 ATR 72-600 and four planes of the kind will be delivered to the country in less than 15 days, IRNA quoted Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan as saying on Monday.
As the official added, nine of the accorded planes will be delivered to Iran by the end of 2017 and the rest will arrive in 2018.
Representatives of ATR traveled to Iran in early February to negotiate terms of a deal for the sale of at least 20 aircrafts.
Iran Air finalized a deal on the purchase of the aircrafts with ATR in mid-February. 
On February 4, Fakhrieh Kashan said the value of the deal is about $400 million.
Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi announced in mid-January that renovation of the fleet of Iran Air has begun, adding that according to the contracts with world major plane makers, Iran Air is to receive 200 new planes, of which 100 will be purchased from Airbus and 80 from Boeing. HJ/MA
