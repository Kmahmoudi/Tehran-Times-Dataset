TEHRAN- Friendly gatherings and the exchange of legislative experiences, according to the deputy Syrian head of the Syria-Iran parliamentary friendship group, are crucial to deepening connections between the two fraternal nations and governments. Speaking to IRNA ahead of leaving Damascus for Tehran on Sunday, Haifa Jumaa said, "This visit is made based on an invitation forwarded by Abbas Golru, the Iranian head of the Iran-Syria parliamentary friendship group, and it is an honor for us to visit Tehran." "The mutual purpose of these meetings between our friends and brothers in the Iranian Islamic Parliament and the Syrian People's Parliament is sharing experiences and renewing visits of our Iranian comrades," the Syrian MP continued. Based on the comments of the top Syrian lawmaker, expanding parliamentary ties is crucial to the development of relations between the two nations.
