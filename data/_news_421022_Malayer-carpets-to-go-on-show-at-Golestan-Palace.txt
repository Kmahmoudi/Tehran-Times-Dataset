TEHRAN – A collection of antique and rare carpets handcrafted in Malayer, west-central Iran, will be put on display at the UNESCO-registered Golestan Palace in downtown Tehran. A total of 17 carpets which are at least one century old have been selected for the event, Mehr quoted Masoud Nosrati, the director of the world heritage site, as saying on Saturday. “It’s the first time that these carpets, which are at least one century old, will find their way out from the palace’s treasure trove to being showcased.” The Qajar-era (1785-1925) offerings are woven by tribespeople and nomads both in Malayer and its surrounding villages in Hamadan province, he added. Every day, clusters of foreign travelers visit the lavish palace, which embodies a successful integration of earlier Persian crafts and architecture with Western influences. The ten-day exhibition will open its doors to the public on February 7. AFM/MQ/MG All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
