TEHRAN – The nuclear deal and its fate is Tehran’s top foreign policy issue in the new Persian year, a former Iranian ambassador and Foreign Ministry spokesperson has said. In an article published in the Shargh newspaper on Tuesday, Hamid Reza Asefi pointed to two important changes in the Trump administration’s cabinet, saying they imply that Trump wants to withdraw from the nuclear deal, formally known as the JCPOA. “Donald Trump is one of the most unpredictable U.S. presidents and also the most hated one,” he said, adding that since becoming president, Trump has fought Obama’s legacies, including the JCPOA.   MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
