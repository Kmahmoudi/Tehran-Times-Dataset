TEHRAN - On Saturday, some media outlets in the Saudi alliance, such as al Arabiya and Al-Hadath, in an organized and pre-planned attempt, reported that Saudi-led coalition had taken control of Yemeni port of  Al Hudaydah. However, it did not take long for the Yemeni political and revolutionary authorities to deny the Saudis and their allies claiming to dominate Riyadh and Abu Dhabi over  Al Hudaydah and its port. In an interview with Al-Alam News Network on Saturday, Ibrahim al-Obeidi dismissed reports by the Saudi and Emirati media that the invaders have taken control of Al Hudaydah’s airport. The battle for  Al Hudaydah is a war of attrition that would drag on for a long time, the Houthi commander added. It would have been impossible for the members of the Saudi-led military coalition to handle such a long war against Yemen single-handedly, Obeidi noted, adding that the invasion is being supported by the U.S. and the UK. Denouncing the U.S. government for giving the green light for Saudi Arabia to launch a war against Yemen, the Houthi leader said the fighting has flared up in Yemen’s western coastal areas upon a decision by Washington. While the aggressors are looking for excuses to justify the invasion of Yemen, the Yemeni forces have no choice but to fight off the invaders and occupiers with any available equipment, Obeidi underlined, explaining that Yemen’s Navy uses its missiles for defense and for preventing heliborne operations of the foreign forces. According to the Yemeni army propaganda campaign, the aggressive forces penetrated from the West Shore were surrounded by three sides and could not receive support except by sea. Clearly, the fabricated lies of the Saudis and Emiratis and their affiliated media about their domination over Al Hudaydah are their wishful thinking. They are spreading such falsehood with the aim of creating a psychological warfare through the media-propaganda against the Yemeni forces.  The main reason for such pretense is the failures of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi against the armed forces and popular committees in Yemen. They decided to target Al Hudaydah after their plans fell through in Aden and Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. Had Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates been able to defeat Yemeni forces in Al Hudaydah, they would not have to bring in their Western allies, including the United States and France.  Thus, the direct involvement of Americans and French with Saudi and Emirati in Yemen is a clear proof of the aggressive Saudi-led coalition’s defeat in the Yemen War. In another event, the French Newspaper, Le Figaro, quoted two well-informed military sources as saying that French Special Forces, are in Yemen along with forces from the United Arab Emirates. The newspaper does not mention the details of the activities of these foreign forces in Yemen. Although the French Defense Ministry has not yet responded to this, a French parliamentary source recently told Reuters that his country’s special forces are in Yemen. Zaifullah al-Shami, a member of the Ansarullah movement’s political bureau has confirmed the presence of mercenary fighters in the strategic port of Al Hudaydah.  Israeli fighter jets have carried out airstrikes on the western coast of Yemen, he added. Currently, the development in  Al Hudaydah, despite widespread Saudi air strikes, is in the interest of the Yemeni army and popular committee’s forces who have made invaders withdraw from the airport for kilometers. The images released by the Yemeni intelligence headquarters all indicate that  Al Hudaydah airport and its port are still outside the control of the Saudi invading forces and their allies. This means that the reports published in recent days regarding the fall of  Al Hudaydah has been nothing but a mass media hypes.
