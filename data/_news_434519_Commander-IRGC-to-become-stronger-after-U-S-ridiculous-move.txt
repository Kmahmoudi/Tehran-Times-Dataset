TEHRAN – The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) will become stronger in its defensive and offensive power, IRGC Chief Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Tuesday. “The measure that the Americans took is so ridiculous,” Jafari said, referring to the U.S. designation of the Guards as a terrorist group a day earlier, Mehr reported. Because, he continued, the IRGC is in the hearts of the people and “our credibility does not come from the Americans, but from the dear and decent people of Iran.” He further said the Iranian Army and the IRGC will be beside each other.
