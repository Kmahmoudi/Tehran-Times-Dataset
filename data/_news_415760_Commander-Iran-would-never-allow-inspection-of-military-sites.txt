TEHRAN – Commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force has said foreign countries will never be allowed to inspect Iran’s military centers. Responding to efforts by Washington to inspect Iran’s military sites, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh said: “We will not give them such a permission.” “The enemy must be pushed back,” he said. “Ever since the victory of the Revolution, the imperialist [countries] have opposed Iran and have conveyed such animosity directly and indirectly.” The top general added these countries try to destabilize Iran as they did to Libya. Boasting the country’s missile program, Hajizadeh said the region’s reactionary regimes and the arrogant countries have come to the conclusion that Iran has “red lines” which can never be crossed. His comments came after AP quoted senior U.S. officials as saying that the Trump administration is pushing for inspections of Iranian military sites in a bid to test the strength of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Iran and the Group 5+1 (Russia, China, the US, Britain, France and Germany). The commander also said the IRGC fully supports the Rouhani administration to help it confront the country’s enemies.
