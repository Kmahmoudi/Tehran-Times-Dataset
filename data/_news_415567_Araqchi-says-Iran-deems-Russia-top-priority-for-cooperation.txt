TEHRAN – Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Monday that his country looks at Russia as a top priority to ink contracts with in the post-nuclear deal era. “We won’t forget our old friends and the countries who stood by Iran in the sanctions era, especially Russia,” Abbas Araqchi said on the sidelines of a ceremony in which Iran and Russian signed a 2.5 billion euro contract. The contract was signed between the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran (IDRO) and Transmashholding, a Russian company operating in rail transport markets. Araqchi noted that signing contracts, including the recent one Tehran inked with Total as well as the contract with Russia’s Transmashholding company, show that Iran is expanding cooperation with various European and Asian countries, especially its old friend, Russia. Hailing the agreement as a “major commercial contract”, Araqchi pointed to the positive impacts of the nuclear agreement on the country’s foreign trade.  A rising trend is seen in Iran’s foreign trade, he added. “We are very pleased that another major commercial contract, namely the investment (deal) between the IDRO and the Russian side, has been signed,” the senior diplomat noted. These partnerships have taken place despite Washington’s anti-Iran attempts, the deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs further said.
