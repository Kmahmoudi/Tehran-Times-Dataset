TEHRAN – Habibollah Sayyari, the deputy army chief for coordination affairs, said on Saturday that the Iranian Navy’s next task is to develop the Makran region on the shores of the Sea of Oman, as the region suffers from underdevelopment. Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari said the Navy is already doing projects near the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north and also the shores of the Sea of Oman in the south. “Today, different regions are under development, with hospitals being built in Jask, Bandar-e Anzali and Konarak.” He also stressed the importance of a “strong healthcare system” to develop the country, and thanked the Navy personnel for their success in implementing different projects.
