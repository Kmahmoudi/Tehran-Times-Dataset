TEHRAN – The value of Iran’s annual fishery exports is set to rise by $50 million by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017), IRNA quoted the head of Iran Fisheries Organization as saying on Sunday. According to Hassan Salehi, the country produced some $350 million worth of such products last year and this figure will reach $400 million by the end of this fiscal.
After the implementation of nuclear deal with world powers in January 2016, Iranian government has focused on development of domestic fishery industry to attract foreign investments and increase the country's share of the international market, he said. 
During the past year, related negotiations have been done with some foreign countries such as France, Romania, Finland, Italy, China, Vietnam, Russia, and Thailand, Salehi added.
Back in November 2016, the General Secretary of the Union of Iranian Aquatics Exporters Ali-Akbar Khodaie told IRIB that the value of Islamic Republic's exports of aquatic products witnessed a 42 percent increase during the first half of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20-September 21, 2016).
