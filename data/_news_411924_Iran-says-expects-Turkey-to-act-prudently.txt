TEHRAN – Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Monday that Tehran expects the Turkish government to be considerate in making comments and adopting stances.
 Iran practiced “self-restraint” towards some comments made by the Turkish government, he said in a press conference. Last month, in successive comments, the Turkish prime minister and foreign minister accused Iran of pursuing a sectarian policy in the region.
 
Larijani also said that asking the Iranians to avoid taking unnecessary trips to Turkey does not mean Tehran intends to undermine relations. Such action was taken to protect the people’s lives, he added. Larijani called Turkey a friendly country to Iran and expressed hope that terrorist acts would not happen in the country anymore. Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday issued a statement warning Iranians about traveling to Turkey. The statement which was published on the ministry’s official website urges citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to Turkey during the upcoming Nowruz holidays. “Considering the security conditions in Turkey in recent months and concerns for safety of Iranian citizens, all Iranians who intend to visit Turkey are strongly recommended to avoid making unnecessary trips and take all necessary measures if the visit is unavoidable,” the statement read.
