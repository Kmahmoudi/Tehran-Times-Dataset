TEHRAN- Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Tuesday that the country’s non-oil gross domestic product grew by seven percent during the first half of the present Iranian calendar year (March 21-September 22, 2017), IRIB news reported.   As Nobakht announced in late July, GDP of Iran, including oil sector, stood at 11.1 percent in the past Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20, 2017), while non-oil GDP growth stood at 6.4 percent in the same time.  He said these figures were released after the Statistical Center of Iran changed the base year from Iranian calendar year 1376 (March 97-March 98)to 1390 (March 2011-March 2012), while the GDP growth, including oil sector, had been announced 8.3 percent and non-oil GDP growth was put at 6.3 percent before that change.
