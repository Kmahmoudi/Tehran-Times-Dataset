TEHRAN - Ali Akbar Velayati, a top foreign policy adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, said on Tuesday that relocation of the U.S. embassy to al-Quds (Jerusalem) speeds up annihilation of the Zionist regime of Israel.
 “Relocation of the U.S. embassy to one of the most sacred religious places of the Muslims will speed up the process of the Zionist regime’s collapse,” Velayati said in a post on his Instagram. U.S. relocated its embassy in Tel Aviv to al-Quds (Jerusalem) on Monday. Israeli snipers shot dead 60 Palestinians and wounded thousands who protested the relocation. Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to al-Quds has been blamed for the bloodshed.  Velayati said that the U.S. move was taken to recognize the Zionist regime’s “illegal” status, however, it revealed more the “cruel” image of the Zionists. “Return to homeland which has been occupied by a tyrant and child-killer regime is a rightful demand which will be met soon. The Palestinians have always resisted and will resist criminal acts of Israel which is being backed by the U.S. and certain reactionary allies in the region,” he said. Velayati, a veteran politician, noted that Quds has belonged and will belong to Muslims. The U.S. move in relocating embassy happened a day before the anniversary of the forcible Israeli eviction of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homeland in 1948 known as Nakba Day, meaning Day of the Catastrophe.
