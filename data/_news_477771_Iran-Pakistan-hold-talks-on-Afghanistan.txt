TEHRAN- Iranian Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian met on Tuesday with Pakistan's Special Representative for Afghanistan, Mohammad Sadiq Khan, to discuss the current situation in Afghanistan and the recent developments. The top Iranian diplomat underscored that the implementation of the decisions made at the Tehran meeting on Afghanistan can bring security and stability to the region and help secure Afghanistan. He said that 4.5 million refugees from Afghanistan are now residing in Iran, of whom more than 1.5 million have immigrated to the country since Taliban came to power last year. Amir Abdollahian went on to add that “restoration of peace and stability in Afghanistan will lead to the return of the Afghan refugees to their country, and the Islamic Republic of Iran will use all its capacities for the establishment of peace and stability in Afghanistan and the wellbeing of the people in that country.” For his part, the Pakistani envoy elaborated on Islamabad’s views on developments in Afghanistan and the prevailing conditions there, which have resulted in the deterioration of people's living conditions due to internal disputes and international pressures, saying that the constructive roles played by regional countries, particularly Iran and Pakistan, are critical.   Elsewhere in his remarks, Amir Abdollahian said although relations between the two Islamic republics are excellent, they still need to be strengthened between the two brotherly and neighboring countries to strengthen regional security.  He also asked Sadeq Khan to extend the warm greetings of the Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to the Pakistani officials, including the president and prime minister. The foreign minister stated that Iran views Pakistan's security as being equal to its own and that Iran is poised to ratchet up security cooperation with Pakistan, which will bolster regional security.
