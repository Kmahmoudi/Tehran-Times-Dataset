TEHRAN- With the involvement of several units, the Ground Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has initiated a massive military drill in Iran's northwestern borders. The three-day drill, known as the IRGC Ground Force's Authority, started on Monday in the Aras region, that includes the northern parts of Ardabil and East Azarbaijan provinces. The major part of the drill began with key authorities present, including IRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami. The large-scale war game, according to IRGC Ground Force Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour, is intended to carry out exercises based on a yearly schedule to improve its combat readiness. As the commander stressed, the drill will include heliborne parachute operations, night raid operations, helicopter combat operations, and suicide drone missions. Based on the remarks of Commander Pakpour, other activities range from building a makeshift bridge over the Aras River, seizing and controlling supply highways and heights, to launching offensives and destructive operations against predetermined targets. He emphasized that although the military exercise sends a clear signal of peace, friendship, and long-term security to neighboring nations, it also symbolizes a potential firm reaction to adversaries. According to a specific schedule, Iranian military personnel conduct routine drills around the country to test their equipment and weapons and gauge their combat capability. Iranian authorities have invariably emphasized that the nation would never negotiate on its defense capabilities and that it will not hesitate to bolster its military might, particularly its missile capability, which is only intended for defense.
