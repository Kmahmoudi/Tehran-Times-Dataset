TEHRAN - The Italian chamber orchestra Cameristi della Scala is scheduled to give a concert in Tehran’s Vahdat Hall on September 21, 2016. In a press conference held at Vahdat Hall, Ali-Akbar Safipur, the managing director of Iran’s Rudaki Foundation, Italian Ambassador Mauro Conciatori, and Italian Cultural Attaché in Tehran Carlo Cereti talked about the concert, Persian media reported on Tuesday. This concert helps review Iran-Italy relations, Safipur said, adding, “We have arranged many fine events and have been able to introduce Iran’s genuine art to the world.” Ambassador Mauro Conciatori called music the simplest means to transmit culture since it requires no translation and one can learn a great deal about a country by listening to its music. He said that for him as a diplomat who had traveled to Iran for the first time, music was the first thing that helped him learn more about Iran. In his brief words Carlo Cereti also said that there have been good relations with Rudaki and the recent World Youth Orchestra’s performance in Tehran in August was a good example. The Cameristi della Scala is due to perform compositions by Italian musicians including Antonio Vivaldi (Italian Baroque composer and violinist) and Niccolo Paganini (violinist), he added. A master class has also been arranged on the side section, he added. Cameristi della Scala has performed in the most prestigious theaters and concert halls in the world. The orchestra’s repertoire includes the principal compositions for chamber orchestras from the 18th century.
