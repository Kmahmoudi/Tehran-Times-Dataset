TEHRAN – Mohammad Sadeq Jokar, the IRGC’s point man for parliamentary affairs, has said there’s no suitable ground for talks on Iran’s missile program and other defense issues. “Certainly, no one in Iran would accept such notion,” Jokar told ISNA in an interview published on Friday. Pointing to Western calls for negotiations on Iran’s missile program, he said the other sides did not respect their obligations under the nuclear deal and this proved that Iran should not negotiate with them on other issues. He also called on the Iranian Foreign Ministry to firmly reject such calls that are being made by Europeans and Americans.
