TEHRAN – An official with the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) announced on Sunday that Myanmar’s government has blocked Iran’s aid shipment for Rohingya Muslims who have been targeted by the country’s security forces and armed Buddhist militants for months. The IRCS had sent a 40-ton aid consignment for the Rohingya through neighboring Bangladesh but the Myanmar government did not allow the relief aid reach its soil, Mostafa Mohamadioun told IRNA. The Rohingya are a Muslim minority community living in Myanmar’s Rakhine State. MH/PA
