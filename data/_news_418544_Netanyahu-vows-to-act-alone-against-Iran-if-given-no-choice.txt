Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Tuesday to act alone against Iran if given no choice, in order to stop what he called “Iran’s aggression” and “its pursuit of nuclear weapons.” “We must all work together to stop Iran’s aggression and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. If we stand together we will achieve it. But if we have to we'll stand alone. Iran will not get nuclear weapons. It will not turn Syria into a military base against Israel,” Netanyahu told the Jewish Federation of North America’s General Assembly.
