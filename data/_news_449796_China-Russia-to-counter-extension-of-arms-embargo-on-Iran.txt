TEHRAN - David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University, has said that Russia and China will counter the United States’ attempt to extend arms embargo on Iran.
 The two countries will use their veto right at the UN Security Council to abort the plan, Schultz predicted. In an interview with ILNA published on Wednesday, he said that U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to weaken Iran. The professor also predicted that Washington’s policy of pressure on Iran will reach nowhere. The United States has stepped up calls for an extension of UN arms embargo on Iran since April. The arms embargo on Iran is set to expire in October. Under the UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal, arms embargo against Iran expires in October. On June 30, the U.S. was rebuked at the UN Security Council meeting, including by the five European countries on the council.  Russia’s Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia slammed the U.S. for pursuing a “maximum suffocation” foreign policy against Iran, saying Washington’s goal was to “achieve regime change or create a situation where Iran literally wouldn’t be able to breathe”. “This is like putting a knee to one’s neck,” said Nebenzia, in a veiled reference to the death of black man George Floyd in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck.  China also voiced opposition to the anti-Iran move, urging Washington “to stop its illegal unilateral sanctions” on Iran. In a statement to the UN Security Council, Zhang Jun, China’s permanent UN representative, said the root cause of the current crisis is the U.S withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposition of unilateral sanctions against Iran, Xinhua reported. “This has again undermined the joint efforts to preserve the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action],” Zhang said, referring to U.S. efforts to extend the arms embargo. “We urge the U.S. to stop its illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and return to the right track of observing the JCPOA and Resolution 2231 [of the UNSC],” he said. Rosemary DiCarlo, undersecretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, also told the Security Council meeting that the nuclear agreement remains crucial to the global non-proliferation architecture and to regional and international security, according to the UN website. In a letter to the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the Security Council circulated on June 8, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the Trump administration of unleashing a politically motivated campaign against Iran and called for “universal condemnation” of the U.S. attempts. The Russian foreign minister said the United States withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and six major powers and now has no legal right to try to use the UN resolution endorsing the deal to indefinitely continue the arms embargo.
