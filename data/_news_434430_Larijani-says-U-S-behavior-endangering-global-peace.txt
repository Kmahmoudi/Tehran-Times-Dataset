TEHRAN – Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that the “imprudent” behavior demonstrated by the Trump administration is endangering the international peace and security.
 Larijani cited U.S. plan to withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) with Russia, its abrogation of the Iran nuclear deal, its pullout from the Paris climate agreement, its economic war against China and the Europe, moving its embassy to Jerusalem in the occupied territories as some instances that are endangering international peace and security, Larijani told the Inter-Parliamentary Union summit in Doha. He noted that such moves show that there is no trust on international agreements because of “unilateral behaviors” by the United States. Elsewhere in his speech, he described the U.S. illegal sanctions against Iran as “economic terrorism”. Doha praises Iran’s stance toward the Qatar blockade  Larijani who had visited Doha for the Inter-Parliamentary Union summit also held talks with a number of foreign officials.  He held talks with Qatari Prime Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani and his counterparts from Iraq, Lebanon and Russia. The Qatari prime minister, in his talks with Larijani on Sunday, said that Iran adopted a “positive” stance on the blockade of Qatar. In June of 2017, Saudi Arabia along with Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) abruptly cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and closed land, sea and air routes to the country. The severing of relations also included withdrawing ambassadors and imposing trade and travel bans on Doha. The Islamic Republic opened its airspace to about 100 more Qatari flights a day during the blockade. Larijani says Iraq can always count on friendship with Iran During his meeting with Iraqi Parliament Speaker Mohamed Al-Halbousi on Saturday, Larijani said that Iran-Iraq relations and interaction are “constructive” and “important”. “You, the Iraqi brothers, can always count on friendship with Iran,” Larijani said. He also welcomed Halbousi’s invitation to visit Iraq. Halbousi said that Iraq intends to hold a summit of neighboring countries’ parliament speakers and attaches great importance to Iran’s participation. Larijani also held a separate meeting with Nabih Berri, the Lebanese parliament speaker. During the meeting with Berri, Larijani condemned the U.S. for blocking aid to flood victims in Iran. Since March 19, large parts of Iran have been inundated with flash floods. So far, about 70 people have lost their lives and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. 24 provinces out of 31 have been affected by the flood. The U.S. is practically preventing aid to the Iranian flood victims by other countries by blocking the accounts of Iran’s Red Crescent Society. Larijani said before departing to Qatar on Saturday that the U.S. move clearly shows the depth of Washington’s animosity toward the Iranian people. He held a separate meeting with Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin on Sunday. Larijani called for implementing agreements between the two countries. Volodin described the agreements as “important” and “strategic”. He also invited an Iranian delegation to Moscow in order to participate in the International Forum on the Development of Parliamentarism. “On July 1-2, the second International Forum on the Development of Parliamentarism will take place. We would be glad if you come or send a delegation,” Sputnik quoted him as saying. NA/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
