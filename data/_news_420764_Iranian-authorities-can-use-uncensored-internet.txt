TEHRAN – Iranian authorities can use uncensored internet if their positions require such usage, Information and Communications Technology Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi said on Saturday. Azari Jahromi made the remarks during a conference in Shiraz, southern Fars province, IRNA reported. He also said although Twitter is legally banned from having activities in Iran, Iranian people are not banned from using the social networking service. No judge can issue a verdict banning social networks, Azari Jahromi said, adding, “This will require a parliamentary legislation.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
