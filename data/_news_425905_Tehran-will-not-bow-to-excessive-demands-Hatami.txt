TEHRAN - Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Saturday that Iran will never bow to the enemies’ excessive demands, saying those who imagine that Iran will surrender under pressure of sanctions are living under illusion.
 “We strongly believe that we will pass this stage honorably and we will turn the enemies’ plots to opportunities for growth and progress,” Hatami said.  The brigadier general added, “Given its great capacities, our country is an undeniable power and the enemies should know that they cannot force this nation to surrender through pressure and sanction.” He also noted that strategic decisions have been made to counter the sanctions and solve the economic problems. U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally left the 2015 nuclear deal on May 8 and announced the reinstitution of sanctions against Iran. This happened despite the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly said that Iran is complying fully with the terms of the nuclear agreement. Only the Saudi royal family, the UAE and the Israeli prime minister have welcomed Trump’s move in exiting the U.S. from the international agreement and reintroducing sanctions.   NA/PA    All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
