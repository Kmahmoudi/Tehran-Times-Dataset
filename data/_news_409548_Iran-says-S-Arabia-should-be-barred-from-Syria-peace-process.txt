TEHRAN - Saudi Arabia should not be allowed to take part in the Syrian peace process, Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan told Russia's state-backed RT TV station in an interview, according to the RIA news agency on Tuesday. He was cited as saying that he thought Saudi Arabia's insistence that President Bashar al-Assad should step down meant Riyadh should not participate in future Syrian peace talks.
