European Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete may visit Tehran on May 19-20 to discuss EU-Iran energy cooperation, EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters. The program is still in the final stage of negotiations, said the EU spokeswoman. According to her, this visit is very important to preserve the nuclear deal as long as Iran, in its turn, remains committed to the agreement, TASS reported. The news comes a week after Trump announced the U.S. would exit the 2015 nuclear deal, also called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
