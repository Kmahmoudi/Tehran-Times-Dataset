TEHRAN- James Cleverly, the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom, has repeated London's allegations in Iran's domestic affairs while rejoicing that more than 300 sanctions have been placed on Iran over the last three months. On Friday, Cleverly made a reference to Mahsa Amini's death in police detention in September as justification for the British government's continued hostility toward Tehran. He claimed in a tweet that after Amini's death, the British government had added 40 Iranian officials to its list of those subject to sanctions. The UK government also rehashed allegations meant to support the unrest in Iran in a communiqué, a copy of which was made public on the website of the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Affairs. The year 2022, Cleverly said, “has been full with unpleasant developments in the human rights sector.” Despite the fact that the EU Council released a scathing report last week on the state of human rights in the British government, the self-proclaimed standard-bearer of human rights has continued to make the claims.
