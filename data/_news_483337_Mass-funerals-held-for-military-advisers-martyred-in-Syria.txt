TEHRAN- Two military advisors from Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) who were martyred in an Israeli bombing last week near the Syrian capital Damascus were mourned by tens of thousands of people during their funeral procession. The massive ceremony began on Tuesday morning in Tehran with mourners from all walks of life bearing the coffins of Milad Heidari and Meqdad Mehqani from Imam Hussein Square to Shohada (Martyrs) Square while holding the Iranian flag. IRGC chief Major General Hossein Salami, Quds Force Commander Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, and a number of other senior Iranian officials were also present in the ceremony. The Israeli aerial raids on the suburbs of Damascus on Friday resulted in the martyrdom of the military advisers. A 32-year-old father of two children, Heidari, came from Kurdistan Province. He was a resident of Qarchak County in Tehran.  Mehqani, 31, subsequently passed away from injuries he received in the Israeli strike. He came from Golestan Province and had a son who was two years old. Writing on his Twitter account on Sunday, government spokesperson Ali Bahadori Jahromi said the Israeli regime’s terrorist activities “will not go unanswered.” Iran continues to support the Arab nation with an advisory mission, assisting it in fending against foreign-sponsored terrorism.  Syria’s triumph against the Daesh terrorist organization in 2017 was made possible through advisory aid of Iran.  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
