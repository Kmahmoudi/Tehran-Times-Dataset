TEHRAN — The residents of the Iranian capital breathed air fouled by fine particles during the Iranian New Year holidays, also known as Noruz, starting on March 21.  While every year during the 2-week Iranian New Year holidays air pollution is eased and the citizens normally experience excellent air quality, this year PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration went high for one day in the metropolis of Tehran.  The concentration of the fine particles moderately polluted the air and caused discomfort for sensitive groups.  Comparatively speaking over first week of the new year air quality has reached a record low for the first time over the past 10 years, Mehr news agency quoted Tehran Air Quality Control Company spokeswoman, Leila Nazari, as saying on Monday. In a report published by World Health Organization in September 2016 some 92% of the population breathes air with unhealthy levels of pollutants which are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. The particles work their way into the lungs when we breathe and can cause cardiovascular diseases like lung cancer, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. The report indicates that one in every nine deaths per year—about six million totals—can be linked to breathing in unhealthy concentrations of these particles. With the median fine particulate matter of 42 micrograms per cubic meter Iran holds the 26th place among 187 countries across the globe. As per the report Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt with median fine particulate matter of 108, 103, and 93 micrograms per cubic meter top the list of most polluted countries worldwide.  MQ/MQ All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
