TEHRAN — Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi has said the crimes committed by the Zionist regime against Palestinian worshippers and those committed by ISIS against Afghan worshippers are the result of movements created by the West. Speaking at a religious congregation marking the anniversary of Imam Ali's martyrdom (PBUH) early on Saturday, Raisi said the current Afghan authorities are responsible for protecting all Afghans, including Shias. He stated that Imam Ali exhorted Muslims to join with the downtrodden against the oppressors, pointing out that the world is witnessing two crimes against Muslims: the Zionists oppressing Palestinian worshippers and ISIS killing Afghans. Regarding the Palestinian cause, the president stated that the fate of the Palestinian nation is decided by resistance movements rather than negotiators. He also described the impending International Quds Day as a symbol of Muslim solidarity and integration, expressing optimism that the day will result in the freedom of Quds and the victory of Palestinians to keep their rights that have been due for 70 years.
