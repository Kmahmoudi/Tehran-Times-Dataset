TEHRAN- The death penalty has been upheld by Iran's Supreme Court for four members of a group of hardened criminals linked to Israeli intelligence services, who intended to jeopardize the nation's security. The final judgments against the Israeli-linked network, which were demolished in May after a combined operation by Iran's Intelligence Ministry and the Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), were announced by the judiciary's media office in a statement on Wednesday. The network engaged in theft, damage of both public and private property, kidnappings, and coercive gathering of false confessions among other illegal activities. Four individuals were sentenced to death after a thorough judicial procedure. The appeal was subsequently sent to the Supreme Court, the country's appeal authority, for final verdict. The four major offenders, Hossein Ordoukhanzadeh, Shahin Imani Mahmoudabad, Milad Ashrafi Atbatan, and Manouchehr Shahbandi Bejandi, received death sentences for their involvement in kidnappings and intelligence collaboration with the Zionist regime, according to the final judgment. Due to their crimes against national security, participation in kidnappings, and possession of illegal weapons, three more network members received prison sentences ranging from five to 10 years. It is proved that members of this gang were utilizing weapons to abduct people under the direction of the intelligence operatives of the Zionist regime. Additionally, it stated that they were getting paid in cryptocurrencies. The statement noted that the prisoners had a history of criminal activity and that they were aware that they were getting orders from people outside the country and were interfering with national security in exchange for payment. Iran has been the target of massive surveillance by the Israeli regime with the intention of disrupting its security and stability. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry said that the intelligence apparatus destroyed a second spy network with links to Israel in late July. The group was going to harm the nation and blow up a crucial defense site.Â  All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
