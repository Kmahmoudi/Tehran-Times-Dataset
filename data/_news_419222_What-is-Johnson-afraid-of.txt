TEHRAN _ The British Foreign Secretary's recent visit to our country is a matter of varying dimensions. The reality is that Boris Johnson is currently in a difficult position. He has been criticized by many British politicians such as Jeremy Corbin, the leader of the Labor Party in recent weeks. Even some Boris Johnson parties in the conservative party have advised him to resign from his position. Under these circumstances, the British Foreign Secretary has traveled to Iran to discuss the security prosecutors, nuclear accords and regional issues with our country's authorities. What is certain is that Britain is guilty of any of these cases. In other words, Boris Johnson must be held accountable for any charges against his government. Regarding the nuclear deal, we have witnessed British decades over the past two years. Following the United States of America, Britain is preventing the normalization of Iran's banking and economic relations with other countries in the world. Currently, British banks do not have the necessary cooperation with Iranian merchants and exporters. As for developments in the West Asia region, Britain is one of the main defendants. Johnson knows well that his country is the main sponsor of assassination and violence in the region. Britain is one of the main supporters of Saudi Arabia in the Yemeni war. Also, Britain is helping Saudi and Bahraini authorities in suppressing the Bahraini people. In Syria and Iraq, Britain played an important role in the emergence and creation of ISIS. In the case of security guards, Britain must also be responsible for spying on Iran. Britain continues to be spies and criminals not only in Iran, but also in many Muslim countries. The role of British security agencies is high on this issue. The most important goal of Johnson's journey to Iran is to save himself from the difficult situation in which he is. The British Foreign Secretary now sees his future in danger.At the moment, Johnson doesn't have much luck to be present at the top of political and executive equations of London. In other words, many people who believed that he would be a good successor to Theresa May, have now discarded this idea. In such a situation, Johnson should throw out the thought of being the next UK's Prime Minister! Many media in Britain now agree that Johnson is a man of great mistakes in the political arena.

He could even gain popularity among people with no particular political orientation. He is also known for adopting liberal approaches among conservatives. Boris Johnson is considered a different politician in the conservative party. He is especially different from members like David Cameron and Theresa May. Johnson was one of the main supporters of his country's exit from the European Union during the Brexit referendum. Adopting this stance towards the departure of Britain from Europe has led to the anger of many of his party members, including Prime Minister David Cameron.
