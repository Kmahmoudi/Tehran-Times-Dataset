TEHRAN — Iran’s border police commander says his forces are monitoring any movement on the other side of national borders, announcing that a terrorist team was destroyed by the border guards of the Khodaafarin border regiment in East Azarbaijan province, northwest Iran.
 General Ahmad Ali Goodarzi broke the news while visiting the border units of the Khodaafrin border regiment on Wednesday. “All borders of the country are under the intelligence and operational monitoring of the border guards,” Goodarzi said. He then noted that with the specialized training and use of modern equipment, there is now complete security at national borders, especially in the north and northwest of the country. The border guard commander stated that Iran will confront any illegal traffic and armed action on the borders of the country. He added border guards’ response to the aggressors will be “harsh and brutal.”  “Recently, a seven-member terrorist team along with military equipment and quantities of weapons and ammunition was destroyed by the border guards of the Khodaafrin border regiment,” Goodarzi added. The general also pointed to the successful operations of border guards in West Azarbaijan province, stating that the brave guards of the Urmia border regiment successfully discovered and pinned down 30 hunting weapons of smugglers by carrying out complex intelligence measures and round-the-clock monitoring of the border crossings in an area infested with criminals and anti-revolutionaries in very difficult and unfavorable weather conditions.  Underlining that Iran is a stable and powerful country, Goodarzi added, “We advise our neighbors not to allow the offenders to act against our country from their soil.” Referring to the recent movements behind the borders of Iran, he said in the last few days, the police has identified and completely destroyed in the shortest possible time with the help of the military and security forces a terrorist team that had penetrated into the country.
