TEHRAN – Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani said on Tuesday that Iran can be a sustainable source of energy for Europe if attention is paid to necessary conditions and issues. Larijani made the remarks during a meeting with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov in Tehran. Larijani also called on Europe to study and solve banking obstructions in economic relations with Iran. Despite the fact that the nuclear deal between Iran and great powers went into effect in January many banks around the world are still hesitant to resume transactions with Iran. Turning point Larijani told Borissov that his trip to Tehran can be a turning point in ties between Tehran and Sofia. The top MP said that banking and economic relations between Iran and Bulgaria can be a role model for ties between Iran and other European countries. For his part, Borissov said Bulgaria can play an effective role in expanding relations between Iran and the European countries. Borissov said that Iran should send a banking delegation to Bulgaria in order to identify and remove the obstacles on the path of expanding ties. ‘Situation in Middle East is critical’ During his talks with Borissov, Larijani also described the situation in the Middle East as “critical”. “Terrorism is not a simple and tactical issue and cannot be settled through a number of air bombardments,” he noted. He said that international cooperation is required to counter terrorism as a global problem. No religion supports the terrorist groups’ actions, however some countries back these groups, Larijani lamented. Iran calls for Iraqi unity in terror fight  During a separate meeting on Monday with Ammar al-Hakim, leader of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, the Iranian Majlis speaker said all the Iraqi groups must get united in fight against terrorism. Larijani also expressed satisfaction over the recent Iraqi victories against terrorists and called for more unity among all the ethnic, political and religious groups in this struggle. Hakim also elaborated on the current situation in Iraq and praised Iran’s support for the Iraqi government and people.
