TEHRAN - Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has vehemently dismissed claims that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has resigned, saying “some elements inside the country publish false reports in a mad way”.
 “It seems that efforts are being made to undermine the country’s diplomatic apparatus and status of the foreign minister and spread lies in this respect,” he told ISNA on Saturday. He also dismissed claims of Iran’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
