TEHRAN – Iranian director Mehrdad Oskui’s documentary “Starless Dreams” won the Cineuropa Audience Award at the 12th edition of FEST -- New Directors New Films Festival, which was held in the Portuguese city of Espinho from June 20 to 27.  The documentary also received an honorable mention in the documentary section. The Golden Lynx for best feature documentary was presented to “Iramaos” by Pedro Magano from Portugal. “Starless Dreams”, which has been acclaimed at several international events, shows young women in an Iranian juvenile detention center reflecting on the crimes they have committed and the harsh circumstances that have shaped their lives. In mid-June, Oskui canceled the Iranian premiere of “Starless Dreams” in order to conceal the identity of the juvenile offenders appearing in the film. The decision was made to avoid any trouble that may arise for the juveniles after the screening of the documentary.
