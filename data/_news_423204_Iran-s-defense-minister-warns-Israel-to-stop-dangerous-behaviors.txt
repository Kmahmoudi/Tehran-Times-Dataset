TEHRAN – Iran’s Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami on Tuesday warned the Israeli prime minister to stop “dangerous behaviors”, saying Iran’s response to any provocation will be “surprising” that will make the Tel Aviv regime to feel “regretful”.
 “I warn the occupying regime of Israel and its allies that they must stop hatching plots and behaving dangerously, because Iran’s response will be ‘surprising’ and will make them ‘regretful’,” Hatami asserted. The warning came a day after Benjamin Netanyahu in televised remarks claimed that Israel had obtained tens of thousands of pages of what he called Iran’s “secret atomic archives” which proved that Iran had developed a nuclear weapons plan, which could be activated at any time. General Hatami said Netanyahu’s claims are “unfounded” Hatami added “Netanyahu’s propagandistic show” is intended to cover up crimes against Palestinians. The Iranian defense chief also said the United States’ “behavior toward the nuclear deal is dangerous for the international system”.   The defense minister said while Iran is fully observing its commitments under the nuclear deal the U.S. is moving to ditch the deal which proves “the Americans cannot be trusted”. Hatami said Netanyahu’s televised remarks, which he called a “show”, were in conformity with Trump’s “animosity with the Iranian nation”. The claims by Netanyahu came just two days before Trump decides to stay or leave the 2015 nuclear deal. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has claimed what Netanyahu said were authentic and showed that the nuclear deal “was built on lies”.
