TEHRAN – At a joint meeting of foreign policy committees of the Iranian Majlis and the Russian State Duma in Moscow on Tuesday, Iranian and Russian lawmakers discussed parliamentary cooperation, economic ties, war on terror in Syria, and the July 2015 nuclear agreement. Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani and some members of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee represented the Iranian side. In reference to the conflict in Yemen, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said, “It is the third year of the war and 10,000 people have been killed.”
 
According to Al-Masdar news, Boroujerdi said, “About 800,000 people are suffering from cholera in Yemen. The reason for all these disasters is Saudi Arabia and its coalition.”  He added, “The developments in Yemen are not related to Iran. The death of the former president (Ali Abdullah Saleh) has nothing to deal with Iran. It’s all about Saudi Arabia.”  The senior MP also said that Iran would “help and support” Syria, and not abandon the country “during the post-war reconstruction.” MH/PA All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
